however, proBDNFinduced apoptosis of natural killer cells is mediated by SORT1 . | Of note, PLGplasmin that is generated by the action of PLAT (plasminogen activator, tissue type) is highly reduced in MS resulting in the reduction of the proteolytic conversion of proBDNF to BDNF. | In addition, SERPINE1tissue plasminogen inhibitor (serpin family E member 1) that reduces PLGplasmin is increased in MS . | Hence, BDNF activators could be a therapeutic potential in the management of MS. | T cells that reach the bloodstream of fingolimodtreated patients with MS may contribute to the neuroprotective effect of this therapy by increased secretion of BDNF . | Fingolimod has a neuroprotective effect against the aggregation of SNCA in PD by increasing the expression of BDNF in the dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra pars compacta in transgenic mice . | Thus, the neuroprotective effect of fingolimod against the development and progression of MS may be primarily through activation of the BDNF signaling pathway. | Hence, the neuroprotective effect of IFNB against the progression of MS is related to the immunomodulatory effect and augmentation of BDNF signaling. | Thus, the neuroprotective effect of ketamine against the progression of MS is linked to activation of BDNF signaling. | Different studies highlighted the point that the potential neuroprotective and antidepressant effects of antidepressant drugs are mediated by activating BDNF signaling . | These findings highlighted the fact that BDNF activators could be effective in the management of MS (Table 4). | TABLE 4 The potential role of BDNF activators in MS. | BDNF activators Findings References Fingolimod Promotes BDNF levels via MAPK signaling and inhibits NMDAmediated neurotoxicity in cultured neurons Glatiramer acetate A longitudinal study found that treatment with glatiramer acetate for 21 months increases the production of BDNF from peripheral immune cells in MS patients IFNB Attenuates neuronal apoptosis by increasing the expression of NTRK2 receptors and BDNF in rats Ketamine BDNF may be the key factor underlying antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of subanesthetic ketamine Antidepressant drugs Antidepressant drugs can enhance BDNF signaling, which is highly dysregulated in MS Ketogenic diet The ketogenic diet promotes BDNF expression in the rat hippocampus Physical exercise Physical exercise improves depressive symptoms by increasing the circulating BDNF level in patients with depression Taken together, BDNF signaling is deregulated in MS and correlates with the progression and severity of MS. | BDNF activators can ameliorate MS neuropathology by increasing brain and peripheral BDNF signaling, which has a neuroprotective effect against the development and progression of MS (Figure 4). | FIGURE 4 BDNF activators in MS: BDNF activators improve BDNF signaling, which inhibits MS neuropathology and associated neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. | BDNF has been extensively investigated, and it has emerged as an important regulator of synaptic plasticity, neuronal survival, and differentiation. | BDNF activators can ameliorate MS neuropathology by increasing brain and peripheral BDNF signaling which has a neuroprotective effect against the development and progression of MS.",

      "text_block": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is critical for neuroplasticity, synaptic transmission, and neuronal survival. | BDNF plays a pivotal role in neuroplasticity and neurotrophic mechanisms that can be enhanced by traditional antidepressants, which have been shown to increase BDNF levels both peripherally and in targeted brain regions. | Ketamine and its S-enantiomer, esketamine, exert both rapid and sustained antidepressant effects through activation of glutamate-related pathways, with neurotrophic effects involving BDNF, as demonstrated in experimental studies. | Among these, the neurotrophic hypothesis has received considerable attention, focusing in particular on the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein essential for neuroplasticity, synaptic transmission, and neuronal survival . | The neurotrophic hypothesis proposes that downregulation of BDNF and subsequent impairment of neuroplasticity are central to the pathophysiology of MDD, linking the disorder to broader mechanisms of neuronal atrophy and synaptic loss . | Conventional antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have been shown to gradually increase BDNF levels with chronic treatment, which correlates with their delayed therapeutic onset . | Approximately 30 of patients fail to respond adequately to first-line therapies, including SSRIs or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). | BDNF: Functions, Distribution, and Implications BDNF is a critical neurotrophic factor that contributes significantly to the development, maintenance, and plasticity of neurons in the central nervous system . | BDNF is particularly known for its role in promoting neurogenesis, enhancing synaptic plasticity, and supporting neuronal survival . | This cleavage can occur intracellularly, within the trans-Golgi network by enzymes such as furin, or extracellularly, after the release of proBDNF into the synaptic cleft, by matrix metalloproteinases or the tissue plasminogen activatorplasmin system . | BDNF, Depression, and Antidepressants BDNF plays a critical role in synapse formation, plasticity, and neuronal survival, making it an important focus in studies of MDD. | This finding supports the neurotrophic hypothesis of depression, which suggests that reduced BDNF levels in individuals with MDD are associated with impaired neurogenesis, particularly in regions involved in emotion and memory . | Antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), have been shown to increase BDNF levels both in peripheral blood and in specific brain regions such as the hippocampus, which is critical for mood regulation and neurogenesis . | The rapid onset of these effects, often evident within hours, and their persistence for weeks after a single dose suggest that ketamines action involves more complex processes than simple NMDA receptor blockade, particularly those related to synaptic plasticity and neurotrophic signaling, including BDNF pathways . | The importance of BDNF and its interaction with TrkB in ketamines mechanism of action is highlighted by studies showing that ketamines antidepressant effects are blocked by the infusion of an anti-BDNF neutralizing antibody into the mPFC , by BDNF or TrkB knockout models, and by the systemic administration of a selective TrkB inhibitor (Figure 2). | Studies using pharmacological inhibitors or genetic ablation models of microglia have demonstrated that the absence or inhibition of these cells completely abolishes the antidepressant effects of ketamine, emphasizing their essential role in the drugs mechanism of action . | The importance of BDNF and its interaction with TrkB in ketamines mechanism of action is highlighted by studies showing that ketamines antidepressant effects are blocked by the infusion of an anti-BDNF neutralizing antibody into the mPFC , by BDNF or TrkB knockout models, and by the systemic administration of a selective TrkB inhibitor (Figure 2). | This is supported by clinical findings indicating that rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, does not reduce the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine and may actually enhance them . | The neurotrophic potential of ketamine has even led to studies exploring its application in patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers . | In fact, recent clinical findings suggest that ketamine may provide neuroprotection and alleviate neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with Alzheimers disease, due to its ability to act as an NMDA receptor antagonist and modulate brain inflammation and glutamate-related neurotoxicity . | BDNF is critical for synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, and neuronal survival, and its altered expression has been implicated in the development of depressive symptom . | The neurotrophic hypothesis of depression suggests that reduced BDNF levels in key brain regions, such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, contribute to the neuronal atrophy and synaptic dysfunction observed in MDD, which in turn leads to the manifestation of depressive symptoms . | In addition, it is important to note that the central neurotrophic mechanisms involving BDNF are studied experimentally with ketamine,

adult-specific mBDNF is more common and essential for developed functions such as synaptic plasticity and neuroprotection . | Through its interaction with the TrkB receptor, mBDNF activates signaling cascades that support synaptic plasticity, neuronal survival, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein (CREB) translation . | The mechanisms via which the mature form of BDNF carries out its neuroprotective effects are phospholipase C-γ pathways (PLCγ), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)protein kinase B (Akt), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) . | Figure 2 Mechanism of brain-derived neurotrophic factor via signaling pathways proBDNF, immature form of brain-derived neurotrophic factor;

CREB, cAMPresponse element-binding protein; cAMP, Ca2 calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. | A neurotrophic imbalance associated with aging resulting from compromised activity-dependent processes may heighten the likelihood of synaptic malfunction, a precursory event in Alzheimers disease . | Age-related deficits in neurotrophic signaling are thought to increase the risk of AD in some people because aging-related poor activity-dependent mechanisms may make hippocampal neurons less responsive to stimulation for the transcription of Cacalmodulin-dependent protein kinases, which in turn causes a delayed or decreased increase in BDNF transcription . | Further evidence for neurotrophic activity comes from a subset of patients tested for CREB activation and neuronal hypertrophy . | A synapse loss occurs in a break in the link between the innervating and target neurons, and synaptic transport dysfunction affects the retrograde transfer of neurotrophic substances . | Because the innervating neurons do not receive the neurotrophic factors their target counterpart generates, these two processes may result in their death . | Table 8 Effects of altered BDNF levels in AD patients BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; AD, Alzheimers disease; MCI, mild cognitive impairment; NPs, neuritic plaques; NFTs, neurofibrillary tangles Author Study Type Purpose of Study Conclusion T. | Longitudinal Cohort Study To assess the association of BDNFTrkB in the formation of NPs and NFTs within a homogenous population of CA1 pyramidal neurons Downregulation of BDNF and TrkB is independently associated with increased entorhinal cortex NFTs and CA1 NPs during the progression of AD Hence, by addressing mechanisms of neuroplasticity and avoiding or attenuating amyloid and tau pathology, restoration of BDNFTrkB signaling, whether through neurotrophins administration, transactivation of the TrkB receptor, or activation of downstream pathways, may provide neuroprotection . | The neurotrophin known as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) stimulates arborization, synaptic plasticity, dendritic morphogenesis, and even neurogenesis in adult brains . | The growth of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, which are broadly distributed in cortical and subcortical regions, depends on brain-derived neurotrophic factors . | It also modifies the activation kinetics of inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the postsynaptic membrane . | Table 9 Meta-analyses studies explaining the effects of altered serum BDNF levels in PD patients BDNF, Brain-derived neurotrophic factor;

      "text_block": "Pharmacological therapies synergistically targeting multiple pathogenic pathways, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation, are prime candidates for neuroprotection. | Then, we review the literature investigating the efficacy of melatonin combinations with approved or investigational neuroprotective agents and of melatonincontaining hybrid molecules, both in vitro and in animal models of AD, PD, and MS, as well as the efficacy of addon melatonin in clinical settings. | We conclude that a better characterization of the mechanisms underlying such melatonin synergistic actions under neuroinflammation at appropriate doses needs to be tackled to advance successful clinical translation of neuroprotective melatonin combination therapies or melatoninbased hybrid molecules. | Therefore, combinations of melatonin with other neuroprotective agents have been investigated, pointing to a synergistic or additive effect in the context of a multitargetdirected strategy often pursued in neurodegenerative diseases characterized by a multifactorial nature. | Two kinds of combinations were investigated: (i) combination of melatonin with neuroprotective agents, either approved drugs or substances with mechanisms supporting a neuroprotective effect (e.g., antioxidant, metal chelator, etc.); (ii) melatoninbased hybrid compounds merging melatonin structure with that of other antioxidant and neuroprotective molecules. | These drawbacks could be mitigated using a single multifunctional compound, acting on two or more targets at the same time, for which druglike properties can be optimized. | Compared to drug combinations, these compounds may offer the advantage of reduced side effects and pharmacokinetic complexity, and fewer drugdrug interactions. | Notably, multitarget compounds could suffer from a challenging optimization of physicochemical properties and pharmacokinetic profiles. | We also mention the major controversies related to the use of melatonin as a neuroprotective agent, mostly generated by the lack of a common consensus for the optimal dosing, molecular targets, and toxicity. | 2 Mechanisms of MelatoninMediated Cell Protection Melatonin neuroprotective activities include cell protection from oxidative stress, regulation of energy metabolism, and modulation of the innate immune system. | It is reported that melatonin exerts neuroprotective actions both directly on neuronal cells and indirectly through the modulation of glial cell activities . | Under pathological conditions, some melatonin effects may persist even in the absence of MT1 and MT2 receptors or upon their pharmacological blockade, indicating the existence of melatonin receptorindependent mechanisms, as observed in studies evaluating the neuroprotective activity of melatonin . | Moreover, in vitro studies performed in transfected HEK293 cells have shown that melatonin receptors may be desensitized by internalization when exposed beyond 1 µM melatonin, suggesting that nonreceptordependent mechanisms or indolecompoundbased actions may be relevant when high concentrations of melatonin are given . | The development of selective melatonin receptor ligands, the characterization of melatonin receptorselective KO mice, and the identification of the phenotype of brain cells expressing melatonin receptors under pathological conditions using wellcharacterized antibodies (for discussion see ) will be instrumental to establish and validate the role of melatonin receptors in neuroprotection. | The MT2selective antagonist 4phenyl2propionamidotetralin (4PPDOT) was able to prevent the activation of the Nrf2 pathway and the neuroprotective actions afforded by 1 μM melatonin in vitro, against erastininduced ferroptosis in neuronal hippocampal HT22 cells, and by 10 mgkg melatonin (i.p.), in vivo, against the spinal cord injury . | Melatonin mitochondrial effects can be mediated by the activation of membrane receptors, of SIRT1 and SIRT3 pathways, and downstream signaling molecules such as peroxisome proliferatorinitiated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC1α), adenosine 5monophosphateactivated protein kinase (AMPK), and Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) . | At 1 mM concentration, melatonin inhibited LPSinduced chemokine expression and secretion in BV2 cells , reduced cyclooxygenase2 expression in murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 , downregulated the inducible NOS M1 marker, and upregulated the antiinflammatory M2 markers arginase 1 (Arg1) and the mannose receptor CD206 through signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation in primary microglia cultures . | 4 Melatonin Combinations Melatonin has been evaluated in combination with several molecules claimed as neuroprotective to assess whether the combination could attenuate the progression of neurodegenerative disorders to a greater extent than a singleagent treatment. | Combinationhybrid compound Disease condition or experimental model of disease Treatment Outcome References Melatonin memantine AD modelAPPPs1 mice Melatonin: 6 mgkgday (po) memantine: 10 mgkgday (po) Duration: 32 days Improvement in episodic memory and reduction of amyloid aggregates compared to the drugs alone. | Melatonin ergothioneine AD modeldgalactosetreated mice Melatonin: 10 mgkgday (po) ergothioneine: 0.5 mgkgday (po) Duration: 88 days Synergistic neuroprotective effect on learning and memory deficits. | Melatonintacrine hybrid 12 AD modelAβ2535injected mice 0.1 mgkgday (ip) Duration: 7 days Improvements in reduction of Aβ2535induced learning deficits and protected longterm memory compared to the reference BuChE inhibitor. | MelatoninChE inhibitor hybrid 13 AD modelAβ2535injected mice 0.3 mgkgday (ip) Duration: 7 days Improvements in reduction of Aβ2535induced working memory deficits compared to the reference HDAC6 inhibitor and melatonin alone or in combination. | Melatoninferulic acidHDAC inhibitor hybrid 16 AD modelAPPPs1 mice 50 mgkgday (po) Duration: 12 weeks Improvements in reduction of Aβ brain accumulation and synaptic degeneration, with antiinflammatory and antioxidant activities. | In vitro assays were performed on human SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cell line to evaluate whether melatonin in combination with the AChE inhibitor galantamine could protect against mitochondrial oxidative stress induced by rotenone and oligomycinA exposure. | The involvement of nicotinic and melatonin receptors in the neuroprotective mechanism was assessed through pharmacological antagonism studies with mecamylamine and luzindole, respectively, which fully reversed the beneficial effect on the AD model . | In an in vitro N2aAPPswe cell culture AD model, AD biomarkers were evaluated following treatment with melatonin (30 μM) in combination with naturally occurring compounds resveratrol (10 μM), vitamin B12 (40 μM), and epigallocatechin3gallate (20 μM). | Supplementation with melatonin and ergothioneine in combination at the same dose as used alone produced an additive or synergistic neuroprotective effect on learning and memory deficits. | Starting from the results of previous studies which demonstrated a potentiated antioxidant effect produced by the combination of the MAO inhibitor selegiline with melatonin in an autoxidation model of dopamine in solution , an in vivo PD model, obtained by treating mice with 1methyl4phenyl1,2,3,6tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), was used to understand the effects of melatonin and selegiline alone and in combination on animal behavior. | On this basis, combination of the PDK4 inhibitor diisopropylamine dichloroacetate (DADA) and melatonin (50 and 10 mgkg, respectively, Table 1) was evaluated in the EAE model, aiming at the minimization of melatonin side effects. | The strategy pursued in the design of multitarget compounds generally relied on the exploitation of the antioxidant properties of melatonin that was combined with other antioxidant agents or with compounds with different, potentially synergistic activities. | In light of the potential receptormediated activity, we focused on compounds characterized by the indolylethylamide structure of melatonin. | On the other hand, multitarget indole derivatives devoid of the ethylamide side chain and connected to molecular portions from other neuroprotective agents (e.g., trientine , donepezil , sulforaphane , have also been described. | The amino group of tacrine was connected to the amide side chain of melatonin (e.g., compound 2, Figure 1) which represents the preferred site for melatonin modification in hybrid molecules . | Compounds from this series also inhibited Aβ selfaggregation and exerted neuroprotective properties in human neuroblastoma cell line SHSY5Y against cell death induced by various toxic insults . | Furthermore, compound 2 produced a significant decrease of Aβ deposits with a reduction of Aβinduced cell death in organotypic slice cultures and alleviation of behavioral impairment, with recovery in memory and cognitive function, in amyloid precursor proteinpresenilin 1 (APPPs1) transgenic mice (2 µL, 50 µgmL, Table 1). | Compound 3 (Figure 1) showed an enhanced antioxidant profile (ORAC assay) compared to the parent compounds, suggesting a synergistic effect between the components of the hybrid molecule. | Compound 3 displayed higher activation of the Nrf2 transcriptional pathway than melatonin and neuroprotective activity against Aβ peptides and other toxic stimuli in SHSY5Y cells . | The lipoic acid derivative 4 (Figure 1) exhibited improved antioxidant activity compared to melatonin (ORAC assay), potently induced Nrf2 transcriptional pathway, being approximately twofold more potent than melatonin, and exerted neuroprotective activity on SHSY5Y cell line counteracting H2O2 cytotoxic insult . | The 2chromone ring is the core fragment of several monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, which reduce the formation of neurotoxic H2O2 and ROS species . | Hybrid compound 5 (Figure 1) was characterized by moderate cholinesterase and MAO inhibitory activity and showed antioxidant properties comparable to those of melatonin (ORAC assay). | Hybrid compound 6 (Figure 1) showed reversed cholinesterase selectivity compared to the parent donepezil, being more potent against BuChE than AChE, greater ROS scavenging ability than melatonin (ORAC assay), chelating ability, moderate inhibition of Aβ142 selfaggregation, and higher neuroprotective effect against H2O2induced cell death on PC12 cell line than melatonin. | The benzylpiperidine fragment was also linked to position 5 of the indole ring of melatonin via a carbamate group, as in compound 7 (Figure 1) which showed improved selectivity toward BuChE, expressed at high levels in advanced AD . | Another anticholinesterase scaffold exploited for the design of hybrid compounds was benzylpyridinium bromide, which was installed on melatonin side chain giving 8 (Figure 2), a potent hAChE and hBuChE inhibitor with greater antioxidant activity than melatonin (ORAC assay) and neuroprotective effect against H2O2induced damage in neuroblastoma SHSY5Y cell line comparable to that of melatonin . | The N,Ndibenzyl(Nmethyl)amine fragment of the AChE inhibitor AP2238 was inserted on the amide side chain of melatonin, looking for hybrid compounds with anticholinesterase, antioxidant, neuroprotective, and neurogenic effects. | These compounds had reduced AChE and BuChE inhibitory activity compared to tacrine and antioxidant activity in the same range as melatonin (ORAC assay). | They also showed good levels of neuroprotection in SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cell line and were more potent than melatonin to stimulate early neurogenesis and cell maturation into a neuronal phenotype of rat hippocampal primary neuronal stem cells . | ITH91IQM157 (9, Figure 2) exerted neuroprotection in SHSY5Y cells in which cytotoxicity was induced by a combination of Aβ and okadaic acid to reproduce markers of both beta and tau pathologies. | It demonstrated greater neuroprotective activity than the combination of subeffective concentrations of melatonin and donepezil. | Melatonin receptors appear to be involved in the neuroprotective mechanism since the antagonist luzindole significantly reduced the protective effect . | Berberine and ()meptazinol are other cholinesterase inhibitors linked to the amide side chain of melatonin to combine enzyme inhibition with the antioxidant and antiAβaggregation activities of melatonin . | Another interesting hybrid derivative was based on functionalization of melatonin amide side chain with a pseudoirreversible carbamate BuChE inhibitor, selective over AChE which is less involved in the later stages of AD . | Insertion of a sixmethylene linker led to compound 12 (Figure 2) with reduced potency toward BuChE but increased duration of action, significantly protecting murine hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells from glutamate neurotoxicity. | Compound 12 reduced LPSinduced microglia inflammation and exhibited immunomodulatory activity, promoting a switch from neurotoxic M1 to neuroprotective M2 phenotype in N9 microglial cells, with improved activity compared to melatonin. | Compound 12 reduced Aβ2535induced learning deficits and protected longterm memory in mice at very low dosage (0.1 mgkg, Table 1), with significantly higher in vivo efficacy than the parent BuChE inhibitor . | The multitargetdirected ligand 13 (Figure 3) was obtained, merging melatonin and ferulic acid into the structure of a selective phenylhydroxamic acidbased HDAC6 inhibitor. | The neuroprotective activity of compound 13 was assayed in a mouse model of AD (Table 1), where it attenuated Aβ2535induced working memory deficits at a lower dose (0.3 mgkg) than the reference HDAC6 inhibitor (1 mgkg). | In the same experiment, melatonin (0.16 mgkg) and an equimolar (0.7 μM) mixture of the three parent compounds were ineffective. | The inclusion of a chelating portion and a cholinesteraseinhibiting carbamate on melatonin structure was investigated to obtain a multitarget, multifunctional synergistic effect for the treatment of AD, leading to compounds exemplified by the 8aminoquinoline derivative 15 (Figure 3). | However, the most protective compounds on HT22 cell line were the phenolic precursors, devoid of the carbamate group . | To enhance the efficacy of melatonin, hybrid compounds with other antioxidant agents were also devised. | Incorporation of the βdiketone moiety of curcumin resulted in compounds represented by derivative ZCMI1 (16, Figure 3) which showed neuroprotection in a cellular AD model (MC65 cells that conditionally overexpress the 99residue carboxylterminal fragment of the amyloid precursor protein) . | Interestingly, the hybrid compound was protective at 0.3 µM concentration, at which melatonin, curcumin, and their combination showed no effect. | The neuroprotective activity was mainly related to the potent intracellular antioxidant effect, as hybrid 16 reduced the production of Aβ oligomers with low potency and did not inhibit Aβ42 fibrillization. | In vivo studies demonstrated that compound 16 given orally at doses of 50 mgkg for 12 weeks (Table 1) decreased Aβ brain accumulation, exerted antiinflammatory and antioxidant activities in APPPS1 mice, and significantly reduced synaptic degeneration. | Since Nrf2 activation is known to regulate antioxidant and antinflammatory responses, melatonin scaffold was decorated with potent Nrf2 inducers to obtain hybrid compounds with multitarget activity for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. | This hybrid derivative exerted neuroprotective activity in two models of oxidative stress in SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells and in oxygen and glucose deprivation models in rat hippocampal slices, with higher efficacy than melatonin . | Within a similar multitarget strategy, compound 18 (Figure 3) showed antioxidant properties and Nrf2inducing activity. | It exerted a neuroprotective activity against toxic stimuli in SHSY5Y cells comparable to that of reference compounds melatonin and rasagiline . | Valproic acid upregulates melatonin receptors and neurotrophic factors. | The dualacting compound UCM1341 (20, Figure 3) combines fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitory activity with agonist activity at melatonin receptors. | At 10 µM concentration, it exhibited greater neuroprotection against a neuroinflammatory insult (INFγ LPS) in hippocampal slice cultures than the reference FAAH inhibitor URB597 and melatonin alone at the same concentration, and comparable to that of the combination of the two agents. | Counteracting neuroinflammation, compound 20 enhanced the levels of anandamide and oleoylethanolamide, prevented TNFα release, and upregulated the expression of PPARα. | The neuroprotective effects of 20 were prevented by PPARα, TRPV1, and melatonin receptor antagonists, confirming a receptordependent mechanism for the melatonergic component. | Overall, melatonin was merged with (or with a portion of) neuroprotective agents acting according to a variety of mechanisms, spanning from enzyme inhibition (e.g., cholinesterase, HDAC, and FAAH) to metal chelation and antioxidant activity. | In fact, despite the consolidated role of receptor engagement in the neuroprotective activity of melatonin, very few hybrid molecules (9 and 20) were assayed for their affinity and behavior at MT1 and MT2 receptors, limiting the characterization of their molecular mechanism, which should represent an indispensable requisite for the rational combination of multiple activities. | In fact, hybrid compounds described so far appear more as proofofprinciple pharmacological tools than optimized drug candidates, with in vivo evaluation limited to few compounds and no investigation of biopharmaceutical properties and pharmacokinetic profile. | In fact, several works had shown that compounds lacking a 5methoxy group, such as in the Nacetyltryptamine fragment, can provide interesting combined effects in neuroprotective assays. | Comparing the activities reported for couples of unsubstituted and methoxysubstituted hybrids, a very limited effect can be ascribed to the methoxy group which generally produces a slight increase in the antioxidant activity measured in the ORAC assay and a moderate reduction of cholinesterase inhibitory activity. | The characterization of mechanisms and interpretation of activity of hybrid compounds is complicated by the choice of the cell models used for compound evaluation since the expression of melatonin receptors in cells used for assays is taken into consideration only for compounds 9 and 20. | The better performance of hybrid compounds compared to melatonin might be due to an effective synergistic activity, but also to a difference in the expression of the targets of melatonin and the combined agent. | Additionally, the superior behavior of hybrid compounds versus the combination of single drugs still needs to be verified, both in animal models and in a clinical setting. | 6 Conclusions The multifactorial pathogenesis of AD, PD, and MS has prompted the investigation of drug combinations and hybrid compounds with multiple mechanisms as diseasemodifying treatments. | It has also been included in hybrid molecules, fused with compounds exerting similar activities (e.g., antioxidant, Nrf2 inducer) or with no overlapping mechanisms. | In the latter case, different signaling pathways are activated, even if the same target can be affected by both merged portions, as observed for melatonin fused with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors binding the peripheric anionic site and the catalytic site, respectively. | Overall, most combinations and hybrid molecules produced an improvement in diseaserelated biological markers and animal conditions compared to singleagent treatment, with synergistic effects recorded for combinations with both approved drugs and natural compounds. | In the field of neurodegenerative diseases, the use of melatonin in clinical protocols for the treatment of AD and MS (see above) reveals the interest of developing new hybrids which can provide the neuroprotective and sleeppromoting activities of melatonergic agents combined with other favorable mechanisms. | This approach is particularly intriguing when some form of synergism is shown for the two mechanisms, such as in the case of melatonin receptor agonistsFAAH inhibitors, where melatonin receptor activation stimulates the expression of PPAR, and FAAH inhibition enhances PPAR activation . | Even if no hybrid compound is still in the clinical phases for neurodegenerative disease, it is important that precompetitive research provides new pharmacological tools to investigate the therapeutical potential of combined approaches.",

Aβinduced cell death in organotypic slice cultures and alleviation of behavioral impairment, with recovery in memory and cognitive function, in amyloid precursor proteinpresenilin 1 (APPPs1) transgenic mice (2 µL, 50 µgmL, Table 1). | Compound 3 (Figure 1) showed an enhanced antioxidant profile (ORAC assay) compared to the parent compounds, suggesting a synergistic effect between the components of the hybrid molecule. | Compound 3 displayed higher activation of the Nrf2 transcriptional pathway than melatonin and neuroprotective activity against Aβ peptides and other toxic stimuli in SHSY5Y cells . | The lipoic acid derivative 4 (Figure 1) exhibited improved antioxidant activity compared to melatonin (ORAC assay), potently induced Nrf2 transcriptional pathway, being approximately twofold more potent than melatonin, and exerted neuroprotective activity on SHSY5Y cell line counteracting H2O2 cytotoxic insult . | The 2chromone ring is the core fragment of several monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, which reduce the formation of neurotoxic H2O2 and ROS species . | Hybrid compound 5 (Figure 1) was characterized by moderate cholinesterase and MAO inhibitory activity and showed antioxidant properties comparable to those of melatonin (ORAC assay). | Hybrid compound 6 (Figure 1) showed reversed cholinesterase selectivity compared to the parent donepezil, being more potent against BuChE than AChE, greater ROS scavenging ability than melatonin (ORAC assay), chelating ability, moderate inhibition of Aβ142 selfaggregation, and higher neuroprotective effect against H2O2induced cell death on PC12 cell line than melatonin. | The benzylpiperidine fragment was also linked to position 5 of the indole ring of melatonin via a carbamate group, as in compound 7 (Figure 1) which showed improved selectivity toward BuChE, expressed at high levels in advanced AD . | Another anticholinesterase scaffold exploited for the design of hybrid compounds was benzylpyridinium bromide, which was installed on melatonin side chain giving 8 (Figure 2), a potent hAChE and hBuChE inhibitor with greater antioxidant activity than melatonin (ORAC assay) and neuroprotective effect against H2O2induced damage in neuroblastoma SHSY5Y cell line comparable to that of melatonin . | The N,Ndibenzyl(Nmethyl)amine fragment of the AChE inhibitor AP2238 was inserted on the amide side chain of melatonin, looking for hybrid compounds with anticholinesterase, antioxidant, neuroprotective, and neurogenic effects. | These compounds had reduced AChE and BuChE inhibitory activity compared to tacrine and antioxidant activity in the same range as melatonin (ORAC assay). | They also showed good levels of neuroprotection in SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cell line and were more potent than melatonin to stimulate early neurogenesis and cell maturation into a neuronal phenotype of rat hippocampal primary neuronal stem cells . | ITH91IQM157 (9, Figure 2) exerted neuroprotection in SHSY5Y cells in which cytotoxicity was induced by a combination of Aβ and okadaic acid to reproduce markers of both beta and tau pathologies. | It demonstrated greater neuroprotective activity than the combination of subeffective concentrations of melatonin and donepezil. | Melatonin receptors appear to be involved in the neuroprotective mechanism since the antagonist luzindole significantly reduced the protective effect . | Berberine and ()meptazinol are other cholinesterase inhibitors linked to the amide side chain of melatonin to combine enzyme inhibition with the antioxidant and antiAβaggregation activities of melatonin . | Another interesting hybrid derivative was based on functionalization of melatonin amide side chain with a pseudoirreversible carbamate BuChE inhibitor, selective over AChE which is less involved in the later stages of AD . | Insertion of a sixmethylene linker led to compound 12 (Figure 2) with reduced potency toward BuChE but increased duration of action, significantly protecting murine hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells from glutamate neurotoxicity. | Compound 12 reduced LPSinduced microglia inflammation and exhibited immunomodulatory activity, promoting a switch from neurotoxic M1 to neuroprotective M2 phenotype in N9 microglial cells, with improved activity compared to melatonin. | Compound 12 reduced Aβ2535induced learning deficits and protected longterm memory in mice at very low dosage (0.1 mgkg, Table 1), with significantly higher in vivo efficacy than the parent BuChE inhibitor . | The multitargetdirected ligand 13 (Figure 3) was obtained, merging melatonin and ferulic acid into the structure of a selective phenylhydroxamic acidbased HDAC6 inhibitor. | The neuroprotective activity of compound 13 was assayed in a mouse model of AD (Table 1), where it attenuated Aβ2535induced working memory deficits at a lower dose (0.3 mgkg) than the reference HDAC6 inhibitor (1 mgkg). | In the same experiment, melatonin (0.16 mgkg) and an equimolar (0.7 μM) mixture of the three parent compounds were ineffective. | The inclusion of a chelating portion and a cholinesteraseinhibiting carbamate on melatonin structure was investigated to obtain a multitarget, multifunctional synergistic effect for the treatment of AD, leading to compounds exemplified by the 8aminoquinoline derivative 15 (Figure 3). | However, the most protective compounds on HT22 cell line were the phenolic precursors, devoid of the carbamate group . | To enhance the efficacy of melatonin, hybrid compounds with other antioxidant agents were also devised. | Incorporation of the βdiketone moiety of curcumin resulted in compounds represented by derivative ZCMI1 (16, Figure 3) which showed neuroprotection in a cellular AD model (MC65 cells that conditionally overexpress the 99residue carboxylterminal fragment of the amyloid precursor protein) . | Interestingly, the hybrid compound was protective at 0.3 µM concentration, at which melatonin, curcumin, and their combination showed no effect. | The neuroprotective activity was mainly related to the potent intracellular antioxidant effect, as hybrid 16 reduced the production of Aβ oligomers with low potency and did not inhibit Aβ42 fibrillization. | In vivo studies demonstrated that compound 16 given orally at doses of 50 mgkg for 12 weeks (Table 1) decreased Aβ brain accumulation, exerted antiinflammatory and antioxidant activities in APPPS1 mice, and significantly reduced synaptic degeneration. | Since Nrf2 activation is known to regulate antioxidant and antinflammatory responses, melatonin scaffold was decorated with potent Nrf2 inducers to obtain hybrid compounds with multitarget activity for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. | This hybrid derivative exerted neuroprotective activity in two models of oxidative stress in SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells and in oxygen and glucose deprivation models in rat hippocampal slices, with higher efficacy than melatonin . | Within a similar multitarget strategy, compound 18 (Figure 3) showed antioxidant properties and Nrf2inducing activity. | It exerted a neuroprotective activity against toxic stimuli in SHSY5Y cells comparable to that of reference compounds melatonin and rasagiline . | Valproic acid upregulates melatonin receptors and neurotrophic factors. | The dualacting compound UCM1341 (20, Figure 3) combines fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitory activity with agonist activity at melatonin receptors. | At 10 µM concentration, it exhibited greater neuroprotection against a neuroinflammatory insult (INFγ LPS) in hippocampal slice cultures than the reference FAAH inhibitor URB597 and melatonin alone at the same concentration, and comparable to that of the combination of the two agents. | Counteracting neuroinflammation, compound 20 enhanced the levels of anandamide and oleoylethanolamide, prevented TNFα release, and upregulated the expression of PPARα. | The neuroprotective effects of 20 were prevented by PPARα, TRPV1, and melatonin receptor antagonists, confirming a receptordependent mechanism for the melatonergic component. | Overall, melatonin was merged with (or with a portion of) neuroprotective agents acting according to a variety of mechanisms, spanning from enzyme inhibition (e.g., cholinesterase, HDAC, and FAAH) to metal chelation and antioxidant activity. | In fact, despite the consolidated role of receptor engagement in the neuroprotective activity of melatonin, very few hybrid molecules (9 and 20) were assayed for their affinity and behavior at MT1 and MT2 receptors, limiting the characterization of their molecular mechanism, which should represent an indispensable requisite for the rational combination of multiple activities. | In fact, hybrid compounds described so far appear more as proofofprinciple pharmacological tools than optimized drug candidates, with in vivo evaluation limited to few compounds and no investigation of biopharmaceutical properties and pharmacokinetic profile. | In fact, several works had shown that compounds lacking a 5methoxy group, such as in the Nacetyltryptamine fragment, can provide interesting combined effects in neuroprotective assays. | Comparing the activities reported for couples of unsubstituted and methoxysubstituted hybrids, a very limited effect can be ascribed to the methoxy group which generally produces a slight increase in the antioxidant activity measured in the ORAC assay and a moderate reduction of cholinesterase inhibitory activity. | The characterization of mechanisms and interpretation of activity of hybrid compounds is complicated by the choice of the cell models used for compound evaluation since the expression of melatonin receptors in cells used for assays is taken into consideration only for compounds 9 and 20. | The better performance of hybrid compounds compared to melatonin might be due to an effective synergistic activity, but also to a difference in the expression of the targets of melatonin and the combined agent. | Additionally, the superior behavior of hybrid compounds versus the combination of single drugs still needs to be verified, both in animal models and in a clinical setting. | 6 Conclusions The multifactorial pathogenesis of AD, PD, and MS has prompted the investigation of drug combinations and hybrid compounds with multiple mechanisms as diseasemodifying treatments. | It has also been included in hybrid molecules, fused with compounds exerting similar activities (e.g., antioxidant, Nrf2 inducer) or with no overlapping mechanisms. | In the latter case, different signaling pathways are activated, even if the same target can be affected by both merged portions, as observed for melatonin fused with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors binding the peripheric anionic site and the catalytic site, respectively. | Overall, most combinations and hybrid molecules produced an improvement in diseaserelated biological markers and animal conditions compared to singleagent treatment, with synergistic effects recorded for combinations with both approved drugs and natural compounds. | In the field of neurodegenerative diseases, the use of melatonin in clinical protocols for the treatment of AD and MS (see above) reveals the interest of developing new hybrids which can provide the neuroprotective and sleeppromoting activities of melatonergic agents combined with other favorable mechanisms. | This approach is particularly intriguing when some form of synergism is shown for the two mechanisms, such as in the case of melatonin receptor agonistsFAAH inhibitors, where melatonin receptor activation stimulates the expression of PPAR, and FAAH inhibition enhances PPAR activation . | Even if no hybrid compound is still in the clinical phases for neurodegenerative disease, it is important that precompetitive research provides new pharmacological tools to investigate the therapeutical potential of combined approaches.",

      "text_block": "The 518 human kinases, known as the kinome, are frequently dysregulated in disease and highly druggable with ATP-competitive inhibitors. | Kinases are frequently dysregulated in human disease, and they are highly druggable with ATP-competitive, small molecule inhibitors.1013 Because of that, kinases have emerged as one of the most important classes of drug targets for combating cancers,14 autoimmune and inflammatory diseases,15, 16 neurological disorders,17 and infectious diseases.18, 19 Kinase activity, localization, and substrate recognition are regulated by dynamic PPI networks composed of scaffolding and adapter proteins, other signaling enzymes like small GTPases and E3 ligases, and their phospho-substrates.2022 Profiling kinase PPI networks can, therefore, help determine kinome activation states, and how kinases are connected to signaling pathways.23, 24 This information can be used, in turn, for determining the mechanisms of kinase-mediated cell signaling in health and disease, and for prioritizing kinases among the 518 members of the kinome in drug target discovery.23, 24 Large-scale maps of PPI networks have been generated using yeast and mammalian two-hybrid systems,25 and mass spectrometry (MS)-based approaches like affinity purification (AP)-MS,26, 27 size-exclusion chromatography-MS,28 protein crosslinking-MS,29 and proximity labeling-MS methods like BioID and APEX,3, 25, 3033 however, there is still a critical need for more sensitive and high-throughput methods that can systematically map kinome interaction networks and their dynamics.23 We developed the 2nd generation (gen) kinobead competition and correlation analysis (kiCCA) approach for the sensitive and high-throughput profiling of kinome PPIs. Like our 1st gen approach, 2nd gen kiCCA utilizes kinobeads, also known as multiplexed inhibitor beads (MIBs), for affinity purification of the kinome from native cell and tissue lysates, combined with a competitive binding assays using our library of broad-selectivity kinase inhibitors (KIs) that we named kinase interactome probes (KIPs).23, 3439 The competitive binding assay is followed by shotgun nano liquid chromatography (nLC)-MS analysis to determine competed kinases and non-kinase proteins. | We show (1) that kinobead AP-MS with diaPASEF increased the analytical depth of the assayable kinome, which we exploited to determine the kinome-wide selectivity of four clinical anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors, and (2) that 2nd gen kiCCA increased the number of observable kinome PPIs by 6.1-fold compared to our 1st gen approach, which we utilized to determine signaling pathways and therapeutic targets that promote neuroblastoma (NB) cell phenotypic plasticity. | NB cell phenotypic plasticity can promote therapy resistance and metastasis in high-risk NB, allowing cancer cells to transdifferentiate from a noradrenergic neuronal-like phenotype to a more mesenchymal-like phenotype.4246 For instance, the noradrenergic-mesenchymal transition (NMT) has been shown to increase NB resistance to ALK inhibitor and chemotherapy,47, 48 and to modulate the response to disialoganglioside GD2-targeted immunotherapy.49, 50 Accordingly, pharmacological strategies to reverse the NMT, and thereby reduce metastasis and therapy resistance, are urgently needed. | Furthermore, we show that inhibiting these pathways with selective kinase inhibitors can disrupt the opposing NMT phenotypes. | To clarify if the increased analytical depth of diaPASEF-powered kinobead AP-MS can identify unreported kinase inhibitor targets, we profiled the kinome selectivity of the 1st gen ALK inhibitor crizotinib, the 2nd gen ALK inhibitor ceritinib, and the 3rd gen ALK inhibitors entrectinib and lorlatinib.54 Several ALK inhibitors are approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) that carry ALK gene fusions.55 Furthermore, the ALK gene is affected by gain of function mutations in 14 of high-risk NB cases, and ALK inhibitors like lorlatinib are being tested in clinical trials against high-risk NB.56 A better understanding of ALK inhibitor target profiles in NB cells will help determine their mechanisms of action, optimize treatments, and avoid off-target toxicities. | TNK1 has recently been shown to promote tumor growth and autophagy, and MAP4K2 and MAP2K6 activate the JNK and p38 branches of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling that can confer therapy resistance to cancer cells.62, 63 Collectively, our results identified previously unreported off-targets of clinical ALK inhibitors, whose inhibition may contribute to their clinical efficacy in NSCLCs and NBs. 2. | These included kinases controlling neuronal growth, differentiation and survival like the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptors type 1 and 2 (NTRK1 and 2), cell polarity like the MAPmicrotubule affinity-regulating kinases 14 (MARK14), and cell migration like the myosin light chain kinase (MYLK, Fig. | To test our target hypotheses, we treated the SH-SY5Y (noradrenergic neuronal-like) and SK-N-SH (mesenchymal-like) cell lines with the selective CK2 inhibitor SGC-CK21 and the selective TBK1 inhibitor GSK8612 for four days.77, 78 To determine inhibitor effects on NMT pathways, we then performed global MS-based proteome analysis; this showed that CK2 inhibition significantly altered the expression of 3,202 proteins in the SH-SY5Y cell line (40 of the proteome) and the expression of 2,147 proteins in the SK-N-SH cell line (26 of the proteome), whereas TBK1 inhibition did not alter protein expression in the SH-SY5Y cell line, but significantly altered the expression of 708 proteins in the SK-N-SH cell line (8.5, Table S2, two sample students t-test, BH-FDR 0.05, N 4 and N 3). | In contrast TBK1 inhibition significantly decreased migration in SK-N-SH cell lines, as did dasatinib, a broad selectivity inhibitor of Src-family kinases which served as our positive control (Fig. | DISCUSSION Here, we demonstrated that diaPASEF-powered kinobead AP-MS and 2nd gen kiCCA are versatile and efficient MS-based chemoproteomic tools for kinome interaction profiling, which includes kinase-inhibitor and kinase-protein interactions. | Specifically, we showed that diaPASEF kinobead AP-MS identified previously unreported kinase targets of clinical ALK inhibitors that may explain their mechanism of action and clinical efficacy. | Thus, lorlatinib may inhibit kinases that are involved in JNK and p38 signaling, and in autophagy (TNK1), all processes that have been shown to promote therapy resistance in vivo.62, 63, 79 Lorlatinib is the ALK inhibitor that has progressed the furthest in clinical trials against high-risk NB to date,56 and has the most off-target kinases of all ALK inhibitors that we tested. | Collectively, this suggested that the polypharmacology of lorlatinib is critical for its clinical efficacy, and that more efficient inhibitors with engineered polypharmacology could be developed utilizing the insights that we obtained. | Drugs and concentrations used were the TBK1 inhibitor GSK8612 (2 μM final, Mechem Express, MCE), the CK2 inhibitor SGC-CK21 (2 μM final, MCE), and dasatinib (100 nM final, MCE). | Then, the TBK1 inhibitor GSK8612 (2 μM final, MCE), the CK2 inhibitor SGC-CK21 (2 μM final, MCE), or DMSO (vehicle control) were added. | Kinase affinity enrichment, KI competition, and on-bead digestion of proteins Kinase affinity enrichment, KI competition, and on-bead digestion of proteins was performed as previously described.23 In addition to the 21 KIPs, the following kinase inhibitors were used as the competitors for soluble competition experiments at the given final concentrations: lorlatinib (1 μM final, MCE), entrectinib (1 μM final, MCE), crizotinib (1 μM final, MCE), and ceritinib (1 μM final, MCE). | Alternatively, we applied a simple p 0.05 (validation mode in kinobead and Co-IPMS data).23 Plotting STRING interaction networks PPI network models were plotted using the STRING web application version 12.0 with the following settings: Edges were scaled with confidence, and only physical subnetwork interactions were considered, i.e., only considering text mining, experiments, and databases.82 Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) For gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we used the ssGSEA2.0 script in R together with the Gene Ontology: Biological Process (GOBP) gene set of the MSigDB database (c5.bp.v7.0.symbols) according to the published protocol with the following minor modifications:83 to rank gene names, we calculated a compound score using the two sample Students t-test log2 MS intensity difference multiplied by the log10 p-value.",

      "text_block": "The Nuclear factor erythroid 2related factor (Nrf2) Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway, known for its significant role in regulating innate antioxidant defense mechanisms, is increasingly being recognized for its potential in neuroprotection studies. | Derived from bee venom, melittins neuroprotective effects have raised interest. | After this event, from 7 to 12.5 h after administration, a diversity of conditions was all ameliorated: inflammation, apoptosis, neurotrophic factors, cholinergic function, and tissue ATP level. | Pathway inhibitors pinpointed melittins direct influence on the Nrf2HO-1 pathway. | Recent studies suggest that neutralizing oxidative stress and restoring cellular redox balance offer a more comprehensive approach to neuroprotection than focusing solely on anti-inflammatory strategies . | This suggests a key and holistic strategy to utilize Nrf2 activators to reduce oxidative stress as a multi-purpose anti-neurodegeneration approach. | Nrf2 activator compounds, which stimulate antioxidant enzymes such as HO-1 production, emerging as new a-rounded medications strategy . | Compounds such as sulforaphane and dimethyl fumarate, both potent Nrf2 activators, have shown considerable promise in clinical trials for reducing oxidative stress and inflammationkey factors in neurodegenerative diseases. | Moreover, Nrf2 activators like bardoxolone and bardoxolone methyl have demonstrated significant antiviral effects, particularly in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication. | Bee venom, a long-implemented medication in Korean and Chinese traditional medicine, and particularly its main component melittin, has gained increasing attention for its neuroprotective effects . | Previous studies have demonstrated a wide and dosage-dependent neuroprotective effects of melittin, though they did not fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms . | Our in vivo experiments, coupling with mass spectrometry analysis, provided strong evidence that melittin could accumulate in neurodegenerative mices hippocampus tissue, and had the chance to directly exhibit neuroprotective effect onto neurons. | Melittin improvement effects were holistic, this compound reactivates the compromised Nrf2HO-1 pathway among with multiple signallings improvement in hippocampus tissue of plagued mice. | Next, another second in vivo experiment was set up to screen which improvement among those mentioned was first to take place: This showed Nrf2HO-1 improvement and cellular redox rebalancing were the first to be detected, which hours later led to downstream improvements in inflammation, apoptosis, neurotrophic factor regulations, cholinergic function, and tissue ATP level. | Using pathways inhibitors, this in vitro experiment on Ht22 cell suggested melittin could interact directly to Nrf2HO-1 system, possibly bypass many intermediates signaling pathways. | This ensures that any negative outcomes observed are due to scopolamines effects, not from melittin (or sham PBS), thereby maintaining the integrity of the studys findings on neuroprotection. | 5Melittin effects in hippocampus tissue signaling regulations, including reactivation of intrinsic antioxidant barrier, suppress oxidative stress, inflammation, stimulate neurotrophic and cholinergic systems. | C The figure shows Western blot results and quantification of markers for multiple regulation system: neurotrophic BDNF and p-CREB, apoptosis Bcl-2 and Bax, inflammation iNOS, and cholinergic mAChR1 proteins expressions under different treatments. | This indicates Melittins potential neuroprotective effect in a scopolamine-induced model. | S.C., subcutaneous injection; I.P., Intraperitoneal injection; Scopolamine I.P.: 1 mgkg; Melittin S.C.: 0.1 mgkg This second experiment aimed to evaluate the time-dependent effects of melittin on multiple signaling pathways, including Nrf2 activity, HO-1 gene expression, MDA and Glutathione (GSH) levels, Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), IL-1β (Interleukin-1 beta), and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene expression, as well as hippocampal Acetylcholine (Ach) and Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, BDNF (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor), and Bcl-2 gene expression. | 7The findings suggest that the foremost notable impacts, happened in the earlier stage (0 to 5 h) after melittin administration were the restoration of Nrf2 DNA binding activity, leading to an increase in HO-1 gene expression to maintain cellular redox equilibrium; This first event was then subsequently followed by the rebalancing of inflammatory, apoptotic, cholinergic, and neurotrophic systems all happened in the later state (7.5 to 12.5 h). | (C) Enhancement of acetylcholine neurotransmitters, brain ATP content, as well as Brain-derived neurotrophic factors BDNF and Bcl-2 anti-apoptosis gene expression, all exhibited no significant changes until the 10th hour (to the right of the blue dotted line); Data are presented as mean standard deviation. | Resuspend the nuclear pellet in a high-salt nuclear extraction buffer containing detergents and proteasephosphatase inhibitors. | Western blot analysis Hippocampus samples were homogenized in a 50 mM tris aminomethane hydrochloric acid (Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), solution with phosphate inhibitor and protease inhibitor, at approximately 2C. | Twenty-four hours after seeding, cells were subjected to drugs treatments for each experiment: melittin only, or melittin glutamate, or melittin glutamate inhibitors. | Inhibitors were used to hint out which pathway might be the focus of melittin: JNK Inhibitor SP600125, HO-1 synthesis inhibitor SnPP procured from SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). | The p38 inhibitor SB203580 from InvivoGen (San Diego, CA, USA). | The Akt inhibitor MK-2206 from TargetMol (Wellesley Hills, MA, USA). | Molecular modeling and molecular docking To assess the binding affinities and interaction patterns of potential inhibitors with the target protein, molecular modeling and docking were performed. | However, the introduction of melittin significantly increased this count up to 8090 (p0.01), confirming the neuroprotective effect of this drug against scopolamine-induced stress. | Melittin showed wide-ranging neuroprotection effects in the examined hippocampus tissue: upregulation of antioxidant defenses and recovery of neurotrophic, inflammatory, and cholinergic functions in hippocampus tissue After behavior experiment, hippocampus of mice was collected to study multiple aspect of biological to explore how melittin performed its neuroprotective effect, as this organ is known to be important to cognitive function . | After proofs of cellular redox re-balancing, we screened a diverse range of pathways to see if other cellular regulations also improved by melittin: BDNF and p-CREB are crucial for neuronal survival and plasticity, and their reduced levels imply impaired neuronal health . | With scopolamine-induced stress alone, we observed significantly decreased expression of key neuronal signaling proteins, including neurotrophic factors BDNF and p-CREB, and the neurotransmitter receptor protein mAChR1, indicating reduced both impaired neurotrophic support and cholinergic function (p0.01). | When melittin was administered to these dysregulated mice, BDNF and p-CREB levels increased by approximately twofold, and mAChR1 levels nearly doubled, indicating recovery of neurotrophic support and cholinergic function (p0.01). | Melittin also reduced iNOS levels by about half, reflecting decreased inflammation, and normalized apoptotic signaling by increasing Bcl-2 levels by nearly 50 and decreasing Bax levels by about a third, demonstrating an overall neuroprotective effect (p0.01) (Fig. | Melittin enhance HO-1 gene expression as in the initially stage of action, prior to inflammation and neurotrophic factor response: In this research, a second, more in depth, animal experiment was conducted (Figs. | Additionally, enhancements in cholinergic parameters like ACh levels, brain neurotrophic factor BDNF and anti-apoptosis Bcl-2 gene expressions, brain ATP levels. | In this section, we delved into the intriguing mechanisms by which melittin actively interacts with the Nrf2HO-1 pathway to exert a profound neuroprotective effect. | This neuroprotection is of great interest due to its potential implications for the treatment of neurological disorders and the understanding of cellular stress responses. | The objective was to determine the highest melittin concentration that did not compromise the viability of HT22 cells, a crucial step to ensure the safety of this potent compound. | 8In vitro experiment with mouse hippocampal HT22 proposed that melittin directly engages with the Nrf2HO-1 pathway to elicit a neuroprotective effect. | B Melittin exhibited a dose-dependent neuroprotective effect in the range of 0.33 μM against glutamate-induced stress, results measured 12 h after treatment. | Higher melittin concentrations increase Nrf2 accumulation in the nucleus, indicating melittin promotes Nrf2 nuclear translocation in a concentration-dependent manner.4 D, E To elucidate the pathway most closely associated with melittin activity, various inhibitors targeting ERK, JNK, p38, Akt, and HO-1 synthesis were employed. | E Co-treatment of these concentrations with melittin and glutamate revealed that the HO-1 synthesis inhibitor exhibited the most pronounced reversal of melittins positive effects. | Measurements were carried out triplicated Building upon this initial screening, we explored the neuroprotective potential of melittin in a dose-dependent manner. | Our results revealed a dose-dependent neuroprotection, with higher melittin concentrations yielding more robust protective effects, the cell availability increased from about 50 up to 80 when treated with melittin (p0.01) (Fig. | Nrf2 nuclear translocation, checking via immune florescence staining is know as a method to visually confirm Nrf2 activator ability of a drug, and is implicated in previous research . | To find out which pathway or protein a drug targets, it is common to use inhibitors that suppress specific cellular defense responses. | These inhibitors help identify the drugs target because when the right inhibitor is used with melittin, the pathway that the drug activates would now be slowed down, thus the drug healing effect now has little use because the pathway that the drug works on has now been suppressed . | Following this direction, we applied inhibitors of ERK, JNK, p38, Akt, and HO-1 synthesis proteins with their respectively concentrations. | These inhibitors were used in previous research to determine target of interaction for Nrf2HO-1 activation . | After introducing the above inhibitor with melittin, the treatment of all inhibitors reduced the drugs protection. | However, the inhibitor that reduced the most this protection effect was HO-1 synthesis inhibitor, which was much more significant than other inhibitors. | 8C) experiments all showed an increase translocation of Nrf2 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, and in vitro experiments with pathway inhibitors suggested that melittin did this while possibly bypass many intermediates signaling pathways. | In summary for this invitro section, the study implemented signalling pathway inhibitors, 3D docking models, and pull-down assays to show that melittin activated the Nrf2HO-1 pathway. | Pathway inhibitors highlighted the key role of HO-1. | The evidence demonstrated that melittins initial action primarily involves enhancing HO-1 gene expression, occurring much earlier compared to the subsequent improvements in neurotrophic factors (BDNF and p-CREB), anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, inflammation markers (iNOS, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β), and recovery of Ach and ATP levels. | A similar pattern was seen in the improvement of brain neurotrophic system signature proteins BDNF and CREB gene expression, which also happened after oxidative damage were suppressed. | Normalization of brain neurotrophic indicates a normal working neural cell neuronal cell health and functions. | Besides, a strengthen neurotrophic system can also support a more prominent recovery of cellular redox balance. | The restoration of this key neurotrophic factor not only improved neuronal cell metabolism but also strengthened the Nrf2-ARE system by activating vibrant neurotrophic downstream signaling pathways, including PI3KAkt, MAPK (RasRefErk), and PLCγ (PKC or CaMK) . | This recovery is crucial for maintaining neuronal integrity and function, further highlighting melittins neuroprotective effects . | This experiment utilized a range of inhibitors to block potential pathways associated with Nrf2HO-1 activation. | These inhibitors help identify the drugs target because when the correct inhibitor is used, it shares the same target as the drug candidate, thus slowing down the pathway that the drug activates. | Consequently, the drug becomes less effective, indicating that it was acting on the pathway, which was indicated by the respective inhibitor . | Interestingly, despite their roles, inhibitors of these four pathways fail to replicate the inhibition effect of the HO-1 synthesis inhibitor in effectively blocking melittins cellular protection which really emphasize melittins direct influent on the Nrf2HO-1 activation. | These interactions are predicted to significantly disrupt the Keap1Nrf2 interaction, thereby facilitating the release of Nrf2 from its inhibitory complex. | 8 and 10), establishing a clear link between melittins molecular interactions and its neuroprotective efficacy. | Research suggests that disrupting the Keap1Nrf2 interaction with small molecules enhances the expression of ARE-driven genes like HO-1, which are critical in cellular defense against oxidative stress . | This reactivation establishes a foundation for the natural recovery of various downstream processes, including inflammation, apoptosis, neurotrophic factor regulation, cholinergic function, and mitochondrial performance.",

LHér. | According to the study of Agrawal et al., quercetin was able to intervene in the coronavirus entry and replication cycle, and so quercetin was suggested as a lead compound to be examined in future studies . | In several studies of flavonoids and polyphenolic compounds in relation to antifungal activity, flavonoids are frequently seen to inhibit the growth of fungi by a variety of mechanisms, including the breakdown of plasma membranes, the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction, and the inhibition of cell division, cell wall synthesis, RNA and protein synthesis, and the efflux-mediated pumping system . | Therefore, natural compounds have been alternatively chosen due to their cardioprotective effects. | 2.7. Neuroprotective Effect In both in vitro and in vivo settings, the natural polyphenol compounds found in various traditional medicines and medicinal plant (Table 2) sources possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which aid in the achievement of neuroprotective effects through several mechanisms , such as the stimulation of endogenous antioxidant molecule synthesis in cells via the activation of the NrfARE pathway , the modulation of a number of signaling pathways, namely NF-ĸB and SIRT , and the exertion of pleiotropic activity on cells . | There are various scientific studies demonstrating the neuroprotective effect of polyphenolic substances retrieved from botanical sources. | Resveratrol, a stilbene-based compound found in the peel and seed of grapes, in peanuts, in blueberries, in bilberries, and in cranberries , produced a neuroprotective effect in in vitro and in vivo settings, including in clinical studies . | Several studies have shown the dominant neuroprotective effects of resveratrol. | In clinical studies of the neuroprotective effect of trans-resveratrol on mild to moderate Alzheimer disease cases, the results demonstrated that it is beneficial for treating the disease. | In the flavonoid class, there are several scientific studies using cellular and animal models to demonstrate that flavonoids, namely, flavones, flavonols, flavanols, flavanones, isoflavones, and anthocyanins, possess neuroprotective effects . | Several scientific studies have demonstrated that quercetin possesses neuroprotective effects in both in vitro and in vivo models, counteracting cell toxicities and suppressing neuroinflammatory processes . | Flavonoids and Polyphenols Sources Neuroprotective Activities References Agathisflavone Brazils Caatinga bean (Poincianella pyramidalis) -stimulating neuron generation and improving the neuroprotective activity of microglia and astrocytes through estrogen signaling Cannflavin A Cannabis -protecting amyloid β-mediated neurotoxicity related to the inhibitory activity of amyloid β fibrillisation EGCG green tea -protecting the rat primary neurons from oxidative stress through inducing heme oxygenase -inhibiting DYRK1A gene which relate to brain morphogenesis Fisetin apple, strawberry -increasing both pre- and postsynaptic protein levels to improve amyloid β142-induced synaptic dysfunction-preventing neuroinflammation through the suppression of many neuroinflammatory mediators Hesperidin sweet orange, lemon -reducing lethality in NMDA-treated mice, decreased the behavioral signs of NMDA neurotoxicity, prevent oxidative stress in the brain of mice Honokiol and magnolol Magnolia -decreasing amyloid-β-induced death of PC12 cells through reduced ROS production, suppression of intracellular calcium elevation, and inhibition of caspase-3 activity -preventing age-related learning and memory impairment by serving cholinergic neurons in the forebrain of senescence-accelerated mice (SAMP8) -inhibiting microglia NO production, microglia expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and multiple signaling pathways Obovatol -augmenting the level of paraoxonase 2 (PON2), a mitochondria enzyme expressed in brain cells, though the activation of JNKAP-1 pathway Quercetin onion, capers -decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and prevent H2O2-induced nuclear condensation-raising the activity of caspase 37 and poly (APD-ribose) polymerase expression -improving lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neurotoxicity such as neuroinflammation-mediated neurodegeneration and synapticmemory dysfunction in adult mice 2.8.

      "text_block": "We have also reviewed the use of selective andor natural SIRT activators as potential therapeutic agents andor adjuvants for AD. | For instance, SIRT inhibitors have been considered in the treatment of several types of cancer , while SIRT activators have been suggested as therapeutic targets for age-related disorders such as Alzheimers disease (AD) . | For the last decade, natural medicines andor supplements have attracted interest, and several phytochemical compounds have been shown to reduce AD hallmarks (such as amyloid accumulation, neuroinflammation and oxidation). | Interestingly, some of these natural compounds have been reported to act on SIRTs, which for some of the subtypes have been reported at lower levels in AD patients . | Finally, we have reviewed the recent research advances in the use of selective andor natural SIRT activators as potential therapeutic agents andor adjuvants for AD. | For example, in humanmouse brain cells, SIRT1 has a neuroprotective action via actions on p53 and FOXO (forkhead transcriptional factors FOXO) across several pathways involved in apoptosis . | SIRT1 can also indirectly inhibit NF-κB signaling by its stimulative interaction with AMPK, which is an inhibitor of NF-κB . | In the CNS, deacetylation of nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 2 (NMNAT2) has been found to have several neuroprotective properties including its actions on heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) interaction, which result in a refolding of aggregated protein substrates . | SIRT1 is involved in the regulation of APP processing and the clearance of Aβ and its activation provides neuroprotection .SIRT1 modulates tau phosphorylation by deacetylating tau protein and influencing the activity of kinases and phosphatases, such as PP2A activation leading to a decrease in tau phosphorylation .SIRT1 regulates neuroinflammation via NF-κB , highly expressed in AD.SIRT1 promotes mitochondrial biogenesis via activation of mitochondrial PGC-1α gene expression , which may lead to a reduction in oxidative stress reported in AD. | SIRT3 activation promotes the increase in neuronal survival and decrease apoptotic gene expression, reduces oxidative stress, regulates mitochondrial homeostasis (including increased bioenergetics), decreases neuroinflammation present in AD SIRT4 Mitochondrial Brain, heart, kidney, liver, blood vessels, pancreatic β-cells Deacetylase, ADP-ribosyltransferase, Lipoamidase, Deacylase DNA repair, cell survival,Neurodegeneration,Cardio-vascular protection,Oxidation, Metabolism. | Furthermore, modulation of the acetylome and activation of several metabolic enzymes (e.g., MnSOD) protects function and redox homeostasis in the mitochondria, which impacts the neuronal survival and synaptic signaling mediating for both short- and long-term memory formation, as well as memory retention, in the hippocampus (Figure 1) . | However, several clinical trials were terminated due to the lack of specificity of these synthetic SIRT1 activators and their failure to achieve the desired therapeutic effects . | The cytotoxicity and multi-target effects of activators of SIRT1 have prompted the need for researchers to explore more effective alternatives for activating SIRT1 pathways . | Recently, SRT2104 has emerged as one of the most specific small molecule activators of SIRT1, and was well tolerated in a pilot randomized placebo-controlled double-blind phase I trial (NCT00964340) involving a healthy elderly population . | With the lack of studies andor results for synthetic activators of SIRT in the context of AD, the exploration of natural compounds able to modulate the levels of SIRTs is warranted. | 4.1. Main Natural Coumpounds Modulating SIRTs in AD Over the last decade, the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions of bioactive compounds have attracted much attention from pharmaceutical companies. | Several studies have shown that polyphenols, flavonoids, and polysaccharides are compounds that can modulate SIRT pathways , offering new avenues for therapy, particularly in the context of AD. | One of these bioactive compounds tested in AD is resveratrol. | These processes may contribute to the neuroprotective (by reducing neuroinflammation and neuronal oxidative stress) and anti-amyloidogenic effects of resveratrol reported in vitro and in vivo, particularly in animal models of AD . | In fact, careful review of the meta-analysis that examined the effects of resveratrol in both human and animal AD cases revealed significant evidence that this compound may be used as a therapeutic andor protective agent for AD . | Although the mechanism via which resveratrol was able to reduce Aβ plaques in the brain remains unclear, this compound may regulate APP processing towards the non-amyloidogenic pathways, leading to reduced production of Aβ peptides (Figure 1 and Figure 2). | This may be due to variations in study design, participant inclusion criteria, dosage and treatment durations, and overlooking other potentially confounding factors (e.g., medications, co-existing medical conditions, or genetic variations for compound metabolism). | Variations in the bioavailability of natural bioactive molecules may also affect the efficiency and therapeutic effects of tested compounds in humans. | For example, pharmacokinetic studies of resveratrol showed that this compound was rapidly metabolized and highly absorbed in humans; however, only 2 of free resveratrol was detected in participants blood . | By encapsulating resveratrol in polymer nanoparticles with a controlled size (1100 nm), the efficiency of this compound was significantly increased . | The natural bioactive compound, curcumin, has shown effectiveness in AD treatment in human randomized trials due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects . | Seaweeds contain many bioactive compounds, including polyphenols, polysaccharides, fucosterol, and fucoxantin, and have been implicated in possessing several biological activities, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects . | Aside from brown seaweed compounds, ulvan is a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from green seaweed species . | Some compounds isolated from seaweeds can pass through the bloodbrain barrier and have been found to have several neuroprotective effects . | Despite a renewed interest in alternative medicine to help treat AD through its modulation of SIRTs, there are currently no clinical studies demonstrating the efficiency of tested natural compounds in AD therapy. | Improving the bioavailability of natural compounds in humans remains a priority in the development of natural medicine. | 4.2. Non-Pharmacological Modulation of SIRTs: Exercise There is emerging evidence highlighting the neuroprotective effects of regular exercise in both animal and human studies, with improvements in the level of oxidative stress and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, which is critical for synaptic plasticity and cognitive performance . | In an animal model of AD, treadmill exercise inhibited Aβ production in the cortex of an NSEAPPsw-transgenic mouse via an increase in SIRT1 levels and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) levels. | A combined approach including a low natural compound supplementation and exercise program may maximise the clinical benefit of SIRT modulation. | Furthermore, individual inter-variability reported in clinical trials may also reflect the need to consider genetic make-up involved in tested compound metabolism (such as resveratrol andor genetic variations within SIRTs genes ). | By taking into account the genetic profiling, the compound doses andor type of intervention may be further considered and tailored to the individual to maximise the therapeutic effects of SIRT modulation. | For example, the cholinergic esterase inhibitor, Donepezil, can cause extrapyramidal symptoms, bradycardia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and vomiting, while rivastigmine increases the risk of all-cause mortality, especially among patients who are critically ill . | Although nanotechnology approaches have improved dramatically in the last decade to enhance the durability, solubility, and transport of the bioactive compounds to the brain, the utilization of this technique is still in its infancy and requires more work for its application in human participants. | In conclusion, the quest for improving efficacy and delivery of natural compounds in AD context must continue considering the growth in prevalence of this disease worldwide.",

      "text_block": "Various antidepressant drugs are available, including tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and selective 5HT reuptake inhibitors. | With a long history of use, natural compounds from ethnic medicines can be used to treat depression . | In various neurological disease models, ginsenoside Rg1 exerts neuroprotective effects via various targets. | 2.1 Pathogenesis of Depression Multiple mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of depression and primarily include abnormal expression of neurotransmitters and their receptors, dysfunction of the HPA axis, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, decreased levels of neurotrophic factors, and imbalances in intestinal flora (Figure 1) . | Different types of antidepressants, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic drugs, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can regulate HPA axis activity in humans and animals via different mechanisms . | These cytokines activate IDO and GTPcyclohydrolase 1 (GTPCH1) via signal transducer and activator of transcription 1a (STAT1a), interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB), and p38 mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways . | Both of these are neuroactive glutamate compounds that activate the glutamate NmethylDaspartate receptor (NMDAR), leading to oxidative stress . | Abnormal activation of NMDAR can inhibit the production of brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurogenesis, resulting in brain volume changes, dendritic atrophy, and synaptic loss. | Peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptorγ coactivator (PGC1α) is a key gene that induces mitochondrial biogenesis . | observed a decrease in Mfn2 expression in neuronderived extracellular vesicles in patients with major depression, which normalized following 8 weeks of treatment with a selective 5HT reuptake inhibitor. | 2.1.6 Depression and Neurotrophic Factors BDNF is an important neurotrophic factor found in the human brain that is primarily secreted by neurons and glial cells . | Studies on the neurotrophic factor hypothesis of depression indicate that the tissuetype plasminogen activator (tPA) plasminogen system plays an important role in the pathophysiological process of depression by regulating the transformation of proBDNF to mBDNF . | The neurotrophic factor theory largely explains the mechanism of the occurrence and development of depression. | Antidepressants can be roughly divided into the following categories: MAOIs, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), tetracyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, 5HT and NE reuptake inhibitors (SNaRIs), and antidepressant traditional Chinese medicine . | An Atype MAOI can selectively inhibit MAOA, and its inhibitory effect is reversible, resulting in fewer toxic side effects and adverse reactions . | TCAs, also known as firstgeneration monoamine reuptake inhibitors, inhibit the reuptake of presynaptic membrane neurotransmitters and have anticholinergic effects. | Nomifensine, bupropion, and methylphenidate are NE and DA reuptake inhibitors, respectively, and are used in clinical practice. | Brexanolone is a novel allosteric modulator of gammaaminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors, which modulates their function both within and outside synapses, thereby restoring the balance between inhibitory and excitatory receptors in the brain . | Recent studies have confirmed the neuroprotective activity of ginsenosides. | Among the various ginsenosides, Rg1 is an active ingredient with neuroprotective effects against neurodegeneration. | 3.2 Availability and Extraction of Ginsenoside Rg1 Ginsenoside Rg1, a marker of ginsenoside quality, is a challenging compound to isolate owing to its small molecule size. | The imbalance of intestinal flora aggravates peripheral inflammation and may contribute to depression by affecting the neurotrophic factor pathway. | 5HT, serotonin;

      "text_block": "Sitagliptin, a DPP-IV inhibitor (DPP-IV-I), inhibits the degradation of various vasoactive peptides, including cerebral NPY. | The study explores the therapeutic potential of sitagliptin, a DPP-IV inhibitor, in mitigating anxiety and PTSD-related behaviors through the modulation of neuropeptide Y pathways. | Thus, DPP-IV inhibitors, such as gliptins including sitagliptin, are widely used to enhance the incretin effect of GLP-1 and GIP, thereby improving postprandial glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes (Frerker et al., 2007; Wagner et al., 2016). | DPP-IV inhibitors, such as sitagliptin (6 mgkg), may have mild antinociceptive, antidepressant, and cognitive benefits in animal models of depression (Kamble et al., 2016). | However, the therapeutic efficacy of a DPP-IV inhibitor following a traumatic experience remains uncertain. | This study aimed to investigate whether early treatment with sitagliptin, a highly selective DPP-IV inhibitor, administered shortly after stress exposure (as secondary prevention), can increase endogenous levels of central NPY and the route of its action toward Y1 receptor-mediated anxiolytic effects. | Experimental Design We conducted 2 experiments to evaluate the effects of acute administration of the DPP-IV inhibitor (sitagliptin) given shortly after the stressor on behavioral stress response parameters in the PSS model of PTSD. | ASR, acoustic startle response; DPP4-I, dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitor; EPM, elevated plus maze; PSS, predator scent stress. | ; ASR, acoustic startle response; CA1, cornu ammonis 1; DPP4-I, dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitor; EPM, elevated plus maze; PSS, predator scent stress; PVN, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus; PVTN, paraventricular thalamic nucleus. | ASR, acoustic startle response; CA1, cornu ammonis 1; DPP4-I, dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitor; EPM, elevated plus maze; PSS, predator scent stress; PVN, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus; PVTN, paraventricular thalamic nucleus. | Abbreviations: DPP-IV-I, dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitor; NPY, neuropeptide Y; PSS, predator scent stress. | Similar behavioral results have been reported with omarigliptin, a DPP-IV inhibitor that can cross the BBB either after oral administration or via the intranasal route (Ayoub et al., 2018; Nahvi et al., 2021). | Importantly, DPP-IV inhibitors could affect several anxiety-relevant peptides beyond NPY, including substance P (SP), GLP-1, peptide YY, and endorphins, all of which modulate stress and anxiety responses (Shao et al., 2020). | Most DPP-IV inhibitors, including sitagliptin, do not cross the BBB (Darsalia et al., 2013, 2014; Lin and Huang, 2016; Mousa and Ayoub, 2019). | Recent studies indicate that DPP-IV-I may possess neuroprotective properties in various experimental models of brain disease (Nassar et al., 2015; Badawi et al., 2017; Kosaraju et al., 2017). | These inhibitors increase the levels of GLP-1 in the circulation, which crosses the BBB (Kastin et al., 2002), binds to the GLP-1 receptor, and mitigates neurodegeneration and neuronal resistance (Siddiqui et al., 2023). | However, under conditions of a disrupted BBB, such as during stress (Sántha et al., 2015; Welcome and Mastorakis, 2020), DPP-IV inhibitors may penetrate the brain directly (Srinivas, 2015).",

      "text_block": "GABA is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter, while glutamate maintains the excitation-inhibition balance. | Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a pivotal role in neuronal survival, differentiation, and synaptic plasticity, and is instrumental in promoting neuronal growth and function. | Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), as a receptor for BDNF, is involved in neuronal survival and differentiation. | Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) plays a vital role in neuronal survival and repair, promoting neuronal growth and regeneration. | In individuals with a history of METH dependence, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) functions as a molecular mediator, playing a pivotal role in the consolidation of memory in response to psychostimulant exposure (Rezayof et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2016 ; Kim et al., 2020). | Moreover, the class I histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI), valproic acid (VPA), has been shown to attenuate behavioural sensitisation (Coccurello et al., 2007). | Furthermore, a specific thiazolidinedione-based histone deacetylase 6 inhibitor (HDAC6I) has been shown to normalize the abundance of acetylated alpha microtubule proteins and reverse METH-induced morphological changes in neuroblastoma cell lines (Sharma et al., 2019). | The frequency of active lever responses, indicative of METH SA, was diminished in rats pre-treated with HDAC6 inhibitors. | METH exposure upregulated the expression of GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor subunits and triggered the concurrent activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) pathways in the hippocampus (Kim et al., 2020). | These METH-induced neural circuitry changes were mitigated by HDAC6 inhibitors, suggesting their potential to attenuate METH addiction behaviors in rats. | Based on the current evidence from both practical and theoretical studies, reducing drug craving in addicted groups through HDAC inhibitors targeting specific HDACs represents a highly promising approach in the quest for METH cessation (Werner et al., 2021). | Low concentrations of these inhibitors preferentially increased α-tubulin acetylation, implicating the selective inhibition of HDAC6. | In the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line, the HDAC6 inhibitor was observed to induce an increase in the acetylation level of α-tubulin by inhibiting HDAC6 in a dose-dependent manner. | Furthermore, the HDAC6 inhibitor was demonstrated to effectively reverse methamphetamine-induced morphological changes in SH-SY5Y cells by regulating the acetylation level of α-tubulin. | If we can successfully study the mechanism by which HDAC expression mediates the behavior of METH addiction in animal models, then clinical HDAC inhibitors might also be investigated as a potential treatment for METH addiction. | This enzyme exhibits neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties and is closely related to several biological processes, including dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission processes, energy metabolism, cytoskeletal arrangement, and oxidative stress and inflammation. | In conclusion, it can be postulated that the administration of miRNA mimics or inhibitors may result in the modulation of specific miRNAs, thereby improving the behavioural manifestations of METH-induced dopamine release, sensitisation, relapse, and cognitive impairment (Zhao et al., 2022). | Consequently, they participate in the regulation of target genes, such as chromatin modifiers, X-chromosome inactivators, enhancers, transcriptional regulators, and post-transcriptional regulators. | MEG3 may also exert an indirect inhibitory effect on the PI3KAkt signaling pathway by regulating upstream regulators of this pathway, such as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Xu et al., 2023). | MEG3 exerts its inhibitory effect on the PI3KAkt signaling pathway through various mechanisms, and the reduction in PI3KAkt pathway activity leads to decreased signals for neuronal overgrowth and survival, subsequently mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation, and protecting neurons (He et al., 2021). | The inhibitory reverse regulation of these brain regions and gene loci following drug exposure may potentially restore them to their normal level, thereby offering a promising avenue for methamphetamine treatment.",

      "text_block": "Additionally, we explored the effect of astrocytic secretome on dopaminergic-neuronal survival, neurite collapse and function.ResultsAt early stages, astrocytes were able to deal efficiently with monomeric α-synuclein (via UPS), and larger aggregates (through MMP9 and autophagy), clearing extracellular α-synuclein and maintaining neuronal health. | Initially, astrocytes play a neuroprotective role by internalizing and degrading α-synuclein . | The astrocytic response to neuronal α-synuclein release thus represents a double-edged sword, with potential neuroprotective or neurotoxic outcomes depending on the astrocytic capacity for α-synuclein internalization. | Thapsigargin, known for depleting ER calcium, acted as a potent autophagy activator by inhibiting rapamycin (mTOR) in a calciumcalmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CAMKK)-dependent manner. | Additionally, as per requirement, the primary astrocytes were also treated with MMP9 inhibitor (MMP9-I; 25 μM for six hours) or proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (10 μM for six hours) or autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine (3MA, 5 mM for six hours). | The inhibitors were treated simultaneously with α-synuclein and the experimental values were compared to astrocytes treated with α-synuclein alone. | The viability of these inhibitors at their respective concentrations were verified using phase contrast imaging and a survival assay with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and observed to be comparable to control cells (Supplementary Fig. | The recovered supernatant, treated with protease inhibitor cocktail, was stored at 80 C until the ELISA analysis. | Graphs were prepared using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software; GraphPad Prism, RRID:SCR_002798) or Sigma Plot 12.5. Statistical significance was denoted by control versus protein treatment; monomer versus aggregate; WT versus A30PA53T; exocytosis uninhibitedinhibitor untreated versus exocytosis inhibitedinhibitor treated . | Mean SD, n 30 Increased pro-inflammatory cytokine and decreased neurotrophic factor release in the secretome of α-synuclein treated astrocytes Pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotrophic factors were quantified in the CM of protein treated primary astrocytes (Fig. | 2Pro-inflammatory cytokine and neurotrophic factor release in the secretome of α-synuclein treated astrocytes: A Schematic representation of the procedure followed. | Significant decrease in glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF; E) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; F) were observed in the conditioned media from the protein treated cells, compared to that of the control cells. | P 0.001, P 0.05; n 6 One possible contributor to neurodegeneration could be the insufficient supply of neurotrophic factors from astrocytes, which are vital for supporting neuronal health and function . | We quantified the release of key neurotrophic factors, GDNF and BDNF, in the CM from primary astrocytes treated with α-synuclein (Fig. | In case of aggregate treated cells, the notable increase in DyLight 488 tagged α-synuclein expressing astrocytes in the presence of MMP inhibitor suggests that α-synuclein release into the extracellular milieu is predominantly mediated by membrane cleavage via metalloproteases. | Notably, we observed a significant increase in the association of α-synuclein with astrocytes treated with α-synuclein aggregates in the presence of an autophagy inhibitor, suggesting that autophagy plays a role in degrading this endocytosed protein form. | This directly indicates the inhibitory effect of autophagosome formation of lysosomes which we have observed and discussed later on in this study. | In line with previous research, we observed a distinctive pro-inflammatory profile in α-synuclein treated astrocytes, characterized by increased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β, along with decreased release of neurotrophic factors GDNF and BDNF. | This can enhance current therapeutic strategies, including exosomal therapy, stem cell transplantation, and growth factor supplementation, to foster a conducive microenvironment and thus improve dopaminergic neuronal survival and viability. | Morphology and viability of inhibitor treated cells: A. | Phase contrast microcopy images of control and inhibitor treated cells showed similar morphology. | Viability (survival) of the astrocytes treated with the inhibitors remained similar to that of the control cells. | Control versus matrix metalloprotease-9 inhibitor (MMP9-I) or MG132 or 3-methyladenine (3MA).",

      "text_block": "Studies have reported the therapeutic efficacy of cannabinoids in treating chronic pain, alleviating spasticity in multiple sclerosis, and serving as an antiemetic.2 Research into cannabinoids applications to treat ocular conditions have revealed its potential in treating blepharospasm38 and lowering intraocular pressure in glaucoma.930 Animal studies demonstrate anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, corneal regenerative effects,3140 and retinal neuroprotective effects of cannabinoids.4154 Several unwanted effects of medical and recreational cannabis use are described in the scientific literature, including nausea, somnolence, and hallucinations.2 Other reports have suggested more substantial effects, including its contribution to the incidence of psychotic disorders.55 As for its effects on the eye, adverse ocular effects of cannabinoids and cannabis reported in contemporary literature include eyelid tremor,5660 ptosis,6168 corneal opacification,69,70 reduced corneal endothelial cell count,71 reduced corneal revascularization,72 neuroretinal dysfunction,7384 retinal vasculature abnormalities,4752 and impaired extraocular motility.85101 As ongoing research explores the therapeutic benefits of cannabinoids, the understanding of its adverse effects continues to evolve. | In the last decade, there has been a 23 increase in global users:1 a growth rate more rapid than both opiates and cocaine.104 As of 2023, cannabis, commonly referred to as marijuana, pot, weed, grass, or herb, is legal in several countries,102 and 23 states in the United States.103 The use of cannabis for medical purposes has occurred for millennia, with the first historical documentation of its medical use appearing nearly 5000 years ago in Ancient Chinese texts.105 There has been a resurgence of interest in the uses of cannabinoids, the chemical compound in cannabis, to treat several medical conditions in the last few decades.2,106,107 Method of Literature Search A systematic literature search of Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and Scopus from inception of the databases to June 25, 2023, was conducted to identify relevant papers. | Pharmacological Effects of Cannabinoids The cannabis plant species contains approximately 540 natural compounds, over 100 of which are classified as phytocannabinoids (plant-derived cannabinoids) based on their chemical structure.109 The most extensively studied phytocannabinoids are Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), which are the predominant psychotropic and non-psychoactive ingredients, respectively.109 The C. | CB1 and CB2 are coupled through G proteins, particularly G io (inhibitory G protein), to inhibit adenylate cyclase and influence mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in some contexts.111 CB1 receptors are also coupled through G proteins to various calcium and potassium channels, promoting neuron hyperpolarization.111 Cannabinoid Receptors The localization of CB1 and CB2 receptors has been delineated using several strategies, each providing unique insights.112 These include messenger RNA in situ hybridization, immunocytochemistry, and quantitative autoradiography.113 CB1 receptors are mainly localized to the brain and central nervous system, while CB2 receptors are predominately localized to the peripheral nervous system and immune system.111,114,115 Most CB1 receptors are located on the pre-terminal axonal segments of neuronal axons, with fewer on other parts of the neuron.116 CB1 receptors can also be found on CCK-positive basket cells,116 on many glutamatergic terminals in the brain,117 and within some peripheral tissues, including the liver,118 pancreas,119 skeletal muscle,120 and adipocytes.121 CB2 receptors are expressed on immune cells,115 neuronal cells,122 as well as cells involved in bone mass regulation.123 The human body produces endogenous cannabinoids called endocannabinoids.112 The endocannabinoid system consists of cannabinoid receptors and the enzymes responsible for the synthesis and degradation of endocannabinoids.112 Endogenous cannabinoids include arachidonoyl ethanolamide (anandamide) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG).111 These endogenous cannabinoids activate CB1 and CB2 receptors, amongst other GPCRs and ion channels.124 The simple conceptual framework of agonists and antagonists is not enough to understand the complex pathways within the endocannabinoid system,112 with a complete understanding requiring an understanding of partial agonism,125 functional selectivity,126 and inverse agonism.127 Safety Considerations The psychoactive cannabinoid, THC, produces many of the adverse effects of cannabis, while the non-psychoactive CBD is credited for its therapeutic effects.107,128 Non-medical cannabinoid products have differences in their relative concentrations of CBD and THC.110 Retailers who sell cannabinoids are not subject to the same strict regulations as medical prescriptions.129 CBD preparations of these products are often inaccurate,130,131 with CBD and THC concentrations often mislabeled.132,133 Individuals who use cannabis for self-medication report treating pain, anxiety, depression, headachemigraine, nausea, and muscle spasticity.134 The CBD concentrations from retail products are often lower levels than those used in clinical trials and may even contain THC levels that exceed legal limits.130 Meanwhile, medical-grade cannabinoids, both synthetic or plant-derived, have more accurate concentrations of THC and CBD.129 Plant-derived or synthetic CBD have no pharmacological differences when tested in vitro.135 Information on cannabinoid drug interactions is scarce,136 which raises safety concerns. | CB1 receptors are located in the central nervous system, including the eyes, and have been shown to provide neuroprotection to retinal cells, particularly in reducing excitotoxicity, inflammation, and oxidative stress.142 CB1 receptors are also located on the corneal epithelium and endothelium.144 While activation of CB1 receptors has been associated with neuroprotective effects, chronic or excessive CB1 activation, often with the use of exogenous cannabinoids like THC, can potentially cause neurotoxicity. | While some studies suggest CB2 expression in the eyes,145 this topic remains controversial.142 They have been shown to mediate immune and inflammatory responses and contribute to aqueous humor turnover, which can ultimately also promote neuroprotection by suppressing inflammation and immune-mediated damage.22,40,146 Barriers to Ocular Drug Delivery to the Eye On the ocular level, topical administration of drugs is preferred as it can reduce adverse effects from systemic routes of administration.147 However, only 35 of the administered dose reaches the eye due to structural and dynamic barriers.148 When drugs are administered orally, only 12 reach the eye,149 and they present with greater systemic adverse effects. | He smoked 15 grams of cannabis daily for several weeks and following comprehensive retinal imaging and systemic workup, he was diagnosed with

presented research data.198 Rat model glaucoma studies have demonstrated that intravenous THC or synthetic cannabinoid HU-211 injections significantly reduce retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death,42,43 likely mediated by IOP reduction42 (Table 2). | Topical administration of cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN 55212-2 has demonstrated similar neuroprotective effects in rat ischemic models of retinal ganglion cell loss.44 Two studies demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of intraperitoneal synthetic cannabinoid HU-211 injections in rats following optic nerve crush injuries, including a

animal studies, this has yet to be demonstrated in the human retina. | Given previous studies suggesting endocannabinoids may offer neuroprotection through anti-inflammatory activity, elevated levels of endocannabinoids may be a mechanism for counteracting inflammation in diabetic retinopathy.188 Applications in Glaucoma Glaucoma is a heterogenous group of irreversible diseases characterized by damage to the optic nerve.199 Therapies focused on reducing IOP are still the primary strategy to prevent disease progression, as IOP remains one of the few modifiable risk factors for glaucoma management.199 Therapeutic and adverse effects of cannabinoids on IOP have been researched by nine groups involving a total of 112 individuals,930 with most studies focusing on primary open-angle

      "text_block": "Studies have reported the therapeutic efficacy of cannabinoids in treating chronic pain, alleviating spasticity in multiple sclerosis, and serving as an antiemetic.2 Research into cannabinoids applications to treat ocular conditions have revealed its potential in treating blepharospasm38 and lowering intraocular pressure in glaucoma.930 Animal studies demonstrate anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, corneal regenerative effects,3140 and retinal neuroprotective effects of cannabinoids.4154 Several unwanted effects of medical and recreational cannabis use are described in the scientific literature, including nausea, somnolence, and hallucinations.2 Other reports have suggested more substantial effects, including its contribution to the incidence of psychotic disorders.55 As for its effects on the eye, adverse ocular effects of cannabinoids and cannabis reported in contemporary literature include eyelid tremor,5660 ptosis,6168 corneal opacification,69,70 reduced corneal endothelial cell count,71 reduced corneal revascularization,72 neuroretinal dysfunction,7384 retinal vasculature abnormalities,4752 and impaired extraocular motility.85101 As ongoing research explores the therapeutic benefits of cannabinoids, the understanding of its adverse effects continues to evolve. | In the last decade, there has been a 23 increase in global users:1 a growth rate more rapid than both opiates and cocaine.104 As of 2023, cannabis, commonly referred to as marijuana, pot, weed, grass, or herb, is legal in several countries,102 and 23 states in the United States.103 The use of cannabis for medical purposes has occurred for millennia, with the first historical documentation of its medical use appearing nearly 5000 years ago in Ancient Chinese texts.105 There has been a resurgence of interest in the uses of cannabinoids, the chemical compound in cannabis, to treat several medical conditions in the last few decades.2,106,107 Method of Literature Search A systematic literature search of Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and Scopus from inception of the databases to June 25, 2023, was conducted to identify relevant papers. | Pharmacological Effects of Cannabinoids The cannabis plant species contains approximately 540 natural compounds, over 100 of which are classified as phytocannabinoids (plant-derived cannabinoids) based on their chemical structure.109 The most extensively studied phytocannabinoids are Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), which are the predominant psychotropic and non-psychoactive ingredients, respectively.109 The C. | CB1 and CB2 are coupled through G proteins, particularly G io (inhibitory G protein), to inhibit adenylate cyclase and influence mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in some contexts.111 CB1 receptors are also coupled through G proteins to various calcium and potassium channels, promoting neuron hyperpolarization.111 Cannabinoid Receptors The localization of CB1 and CB2 receptors has been delineated using several strategies, each providing unique insights.112 These include messenger RNA in situ hybridization, immunocytochemistry, and quantitative autoradiography.113 CB1 receptors are mainly localized to the brain and central nervous system, while CB2 receptors are predominately localized to the peripheral nervous system and immune system.111,114,115 Most CB1 receptors are located on the pre-terminal axonal segments of neuronal axons, with fewer on other parts of the neuron.116 CB1 receptors can also be found on CCK-positive basket cells,116 on many glutamatergic terminals in the brain,117 and within some peripheral tissues, including the liver,118 pancreas,119 skeletal muscle,120 and adipocytes.121 CB2 receptors are expressed on immune cells,115 neuronal cells,122 as well as cells involved in bone mass regulation.123 The human body produces endogenous cannabinoids called endocannabinoids.112 The endocannabinoid system consists of cannabinoid receptors and the enzymes responsible for the synthesis and degradation of endocannabinoids.112 Endogenous cannabinoids include arachidonoyl ethanolamide (anandamide) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG).111 These endogenous cannabinoids activate CB1 and CB2 receptors, amongst other GPCRs and ion channels.124 The simple conceptual framework of agonists and antagonists is not enough to understand the complex pathways within the endocannabinoid system,112 with a complete understanding requiring an understanding of partial agonism,125 functional selectivity,126 and inverse agonism.127 Safety Considerations The psychoactive cannabinoid, THC, produces many of the adverse effects of cannabis, while the non-psychoactive CBD is credited for its therapeutic effects.107,128 Non-medical cannabinoid products have differences in their relative concentrations of CBD and THC.110 Retailers who sell cannabinoids are not subject to the same strict regulations as medical prescriptions.129 CBD preparations of these products are often inaccurate,130,131 with CBD and THC concentrations often mislabeled.132,133 Individuals who use cannabis for self-medication report treating pain, anxiety, depression, headachemigraine, nausea, and muscle spasticity.134 The CBD concentrations from retail products are often lower levels than those used in clinical trials and may even contain THC levels that exceed legal limits.130 Meanwhile, medical-grade cannabinoids, both synthetic or plant-derived, have more accurate concentrations of THC and CBD.129 Plant-derived or synthetic CBD have no pharmacological differences when tested in vitro.135 Information on cannabinoid drug interactions is scarce,136 which raises safety concerns. | CB1 receptors are located in the central nervous system, including the eyes, and have been shown to provide neuroprotection to retinal cells, particularly in reducing excitotoxicity, inflammation, and oxidative stress.142 CB1 receptors are also located on the corneal epithelium and endothelium.144 While activation of CB1 receptors has been associated with neuroprotective effects, chronic or excessive CB1 activation, often with the use of exogenous cannabinoids like THC, can potentially cause neurotoxicity. | While some studies suggest CB2 expression in the eyes,145 this topic remains controversial.142 They have been shown to mediate immune and inflammatory responses and contribute to aqueous humor turnover, which can ultimately also promote neuroprotection by suppressing inflammation and immune-mediated damage.22,40,146 Barriers to Ocular Drug Delivery to the Eye On the ocular level, topical administration of drugs is preferred as it can reduce adverse effects from systemic routes of administration.147 However, only 35 of the administered dose reaches the eye due to structural and dynamic barriers.148 When drugs are administered orally, only 12 reach the eye,149 and they present with greater systemic adverse effects. | He smoked 15 grams of cannabis daily for several weeks and following comprehensive retinal imaging and systemic workup, he was diagnosed with

      "text_block": "This review highlights the therapeutic potential of these bioactive compounds, which modulate key biological pathways, making them promising candidates for PC intervention. | The demonstrated benefits of these natural compounds in cancer management have spurred extensive academic interest. | Naturally occurring compounds, especially flavonoids, are considered important sources for the development of novel anti-cancer drugs and have shown great potential in this regard (4). | Flavonoid-rich herbs are a class of bioactive compounds that have been extensively studied and incorporated into traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for centuries (5). | Abundant reservoirs of these natural polyphenolic compounds can be traced within a diverse array of fruits, vegetables, and herbs extensively employed within formulations of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). | Among these compounds, flavonoids are known for their multifaceted pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory effects. | This ancient practice reflects a deep-rooted understanding of using flavonoid-rich botanicals alongside other natural compounds to create synergistic healing effects. | 2 Flavonoid compounds and their characteristics 2.1 Definition and classification of flavonoid compounds Flavonoids, which are abundant in plants, represent a category of innate polyphenolic compounds distinguished by their distinct chemical configurations. | 2.2 Natural sources of flavonoid compounds Flavonoid compounds are abundantly found in nature, predominantly in various plants and fruits. | Honeysuckle and Sophora japonica contain anti-inflammatory flavonoids such as Quercetin and Rutin, whereas Hawthorn supports cardiovascular health via similar compounds (12). | A broad spectrum of biological activities is shown by flavonoid compounds, coupled with distinctive attributes that render them compelling subjects for exploration within scientific research and medical contexts. | Renowned for their robust antioxidant attributes, these innate polyphenolic compounds play pivotal roles in counteracting free radicals and safeguarding cells against the perils of oxidative stress and the resulting harm. | The potential of flavonoid compounds to exert anti-cancer effects has been a topic of significant discussion and research in the scientific community. | Flavonoids, as natural polyphenolic compounds, have shown promising results in inhibiting tumor growth, inducing cancer cell apoptosis, and in conjunction with diverse pathways of cellular signaling implicated in the progression of cancer. | These compounds have the ability to impede the proliferation of cancer cells, trigger cell cycle arrest, and facilitate apoptosis, making them promising candidates for future cancer therapies. | 2.2.1 Epigallocatechin-3-gallate Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a compound isolated from green tea (Figure 1A), exhibits significant anti-cancer activity (15, 16). | (19), who further corroborated the inhibitory effects of EGCG on NF-κB activity in PC cell lines. | 2.2.2 Apigenin Apigenin (4,5,7-trihydroxyflavone) (Figure 1B), which is categorized as a flavone, is a naturally occurring compound derived from plants. | Its attributes include antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, antigenotoxic, antiallergic, neuroprotective, cardioprotective, and antibacterial effects (23, 24). | Subsequent validation revealed that miR-139-3p and miR-196b-5p drive apoptosis in human Panc-1 PC cells by targeting the yeast gene NOB1 and the growth inhibitory factor ING5, respectively (39). | (46) demonstrated that Wogonin exerted a potent inhibitory effect on the survival and proliferation of PC cells, ultimately leading to cell death. | Importantly, the Wogonin-induced ferroptosis-associated processes were ameliorated by ferroptosis inhibitors, confirming the central role of ferroptosis in its anti-cancer activity. | 2.2.5 Chrysin Chrysin (Figure 1E) is a naturally occurring compound endowed with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-cancer properties. | This natural polyphenolic compound exhibits diverse pharmacological activities, including antihypertensive, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, and anticancer effects, attributed to its capacity to modulate biological pathways and its antioxidant properties. | However, the introduction of the AMPK inhibitor compound C failed to attenuate autophagy. | The inhibition of the AMPKmTOR pathway via the AMPK inhibitor compound C seems to increase p8-dependent autophagy. | 2.2.10 Kaempferol Kaempferol (3,5,7-trihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4H-chromen-4-one) (Figure 1J), also known as indigo yellow, is a flavonoid compound that is present extensively in various vegetables, fruits, and herbal medicines. | (71) has documented the efficacy of Kaempferol in conjunction with erlotinib (ERL), an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), for preventing the growth of PC. | (83) have extensively demonstrated the inhibitory impact of Isoliquiritigenin on the in vitro and in vivo growth of PC cells. | This fluorescent marker system revealed that Isoliquiritigenin functions as a late-stage autophagy inhibitor, significantly enhancing the therapeutic effects of gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil in pancreatic cancer cells through synergistic inhibition of cell survival mechanisms. | (83) also highlights how Isoliquiritigenin-induced activation of p38 MAPK impedes autophagy, thus antagonizing autophagy induced by p38 inhibitors. | Xanthohumol acts as an inhibitor; in vitro, it blocks PC cell proliferation at concentrations 10 μmolL and specifically targets NF-kB-driven angiogenesis at concentrations 5 μmolL without causing cytotoxicity. | (94) extended their research to combination therapy, where the synergistic combination of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor TSA and Silibinin induced G2M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in the cell lines Panc1 and Capan2. | These findings suggest that the innovative combination of HDAC inhibitors and Silibinin has the potential to treat PC (94). | Further studies revealed that mTOR activators abolished the inhibitory effect of Puerarin on PC cells, suggesting that mTOR plays a crucial role in the anti-tumor effect of Puerarin on PDAC. | Pharmacological studies has confirmed the neuroprotective, cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer effects of Icariin (98, 99). | 2.2.17 Morusin Morusin (Figure 1Q), a flavonoid isolated from Morus alba (mulberry tree), has demonstrated potent anti-cancer properties by inhibiting key oncogenic pathways such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in prostate, pancreatic, and liver cancers (104). | Morusin specifically inhibits IκB kinase (IKK), preventing the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, the endogenous inhibitor of NF-κB (as shown in Figure 2). | 2.2.18 Anthocyanins Anthocyanins (Figure 1R), particularly anthocyanin-3-glucoside (C-3-O-G), are well-known flavonoid compounds with potent anti-cancer chemopreventive properties. | These findings indicate that targeting these-signaling pathways has therapeutic potential for Polyphenol-rich Anthocyanin Mixtures (PAMs), which are natural compounds found in plants, known for their anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. | Each of these processes is influenced by specific molecular targets and signaling pathways that flavonoid compounds interact with. | Flavonoids such as EGCG, Apigenin, Baicalein and Quercetin are the natural compounds that inhibit BCL2 (a well-known anti-apoptotic protein) (106, 107), as reported in Wogonin-induced apoptosis of human hepatoma. | These results permit apoptotic signals to take over and induce cell death in transformed cells by relieving the inhibitory effect of BCL2 on apoptosis (108, 109). | By mitigating the actions of both IDO and TNF, these bioactive compounds may play a significant role in curtailing the inflammatory processes associated with breast cancer development. | These compounds have exerted their efficacy through the modulation of proinflammatory cytokines (IL6, TNF) and oncogenes (Cyclin D1, MMP-9 and VEGF) by inhibiting NF-kB activationas illustrated in Figure 2. | These compounds, Fisetin, Apigenin, and Isoliquiritigenin also blocked the phosphorylation of p38 signaling pathway to release apoptosis proteins Caspase 3 and BaxBcl2 (106). | 4.1.7 Morusin and Anthocyanins Morusin, a flavonoid isolated from Morus alba (mulberry tree), and Anthocyanins, a group of pigments found in berries and grapes, are strong inhibitors of the NF-κB and STAT3 pathways (143). | Scutellaria baicalensis, a widely used clinical compound, contains various bioactive constituents such as Baicalin, Wogonin, Quercetin, Fisetin, Naringenin, Isoliquiritigenin, Xanthohumol, Puerarin, Icariin, and mulberry, in addition to traditional Chinese medicinal compounds such as ginkgo, continues, liquorice, and Sophora flavescens (149).",

growth of PC. | (83) have extensively demonstrated the inhibitory impact of Isoliquiritigenin on the in vitro and in vivo growth of PC cells. | This fluorescent marker system revealed that Isoliquiritigenin functions as a late-stage autophagy inhibitor, significantly enhancing the therapeutic effects of gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil in pancreatic cancer cells through synergistic inhibition of cell survival mechanisms. | (83) also highlights how Isoliquiritigenin-induced activation of p38 MAPK impedes autophagy, thus antagonizing autophagy induced by p38 inhibitors. | Xanthohumol acts as an inhibitor; in vitro, it blocks PC cell proliferation at concentrations 10 μmolL and specifically targets NF-kB-driven angiogenesis at concentrations 5 μmolL without causing cytotoxicity. | (94) extended their research to combination therapy, where the synergistic combination of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor TSA and Silibinin induced G2M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in the cell lines Panc1 and Capan2. | These findings suggest that the innovative combination of HDAC inhibitors and Silibinin has the potential to treat PC (94). | Further studies revealed that mTOR activators abolished the inhibitory effect of Puerarin on PC cells, suggesting that mTOR plays a crucial role in the anti-tumor effect of Puerarin on PDAC. | Pharmacological studies has confirmed the neuroprotective, cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer effects of Icariin (98, 99). | 2.2.17 Morusin Morusin (Figure 1Q), a flavonoid isolated from Morus alba (mulberry tree), has demonstrated potent anti-cancer properties by inhibiting key oncogenic pathways such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in prostate, pancreatic, and liver cancers (104). | Morusin specifically inhibits IκB kinase (IKK), preventing the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, the endogenous inhibitor of NF-κB (as shown in Figure 2). | 2.2.18 Anthocyanins Anthocyanins (Figure 1R), particularly anthocyanin-3-glucoside (C-3-O-G), are well-known flavonoid compounds with potent anti-cancer chemopreventive properties. | These findings indicate that targeting these-signaling pathways has therapeutic potential for Polyphenol-rich Anthocyanin Mixtures (PAMs), which are natural compounds found in plants, known for their anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. | Each of these processes is influenced by specific molecular targets and signaling pathways that flavonoid compounds interact with. | Flavonoids such as EGCG, Apigenin, Baicalein and Quercetin are the natural compounds that inhibit BCL2 (a well-known anti-apoptotic protein) (106, 107), as reported in Wogonin-induced apoptosis of human hepatoma. | These results permit apoptotic signals to take over and induce cell death in transformed cells by relieving the inhibitory effect of BCL2 on apoptosis (108, 109). | By mitigating the actions of both IDO and TNF, these bioactive compounds may play a significant role in curtailing the inflammatory processes associated with breast cancer development. | These compounds have exerted their efficacy through the modulation of proinflammatory cytokines (IL6, TNF) and oncogenes (Cyclin D1, MMP-9 and VEGF) by inhibiting NF-kB activationas illustrated in Figure 2. | These compounds, Fisetin, Apigenin, and Isoliquiritigenin also blocked the phosphorylation of p38 signaling pathway to release apoptosis proteins Caspase 3 and BaxBcl2 (106). | 4.1.7 Morusin and Anthocyanins Morusin, a flavonoid isolated from Morus alba (mulberry tree), and Anthocyanins, a group of pigments found in berries and grapes, are strong inhibitors of the NF-κB and STAT3 pathways (143). | Scutellaria baicalensis, a widely used clinical compound, contains various bioactive constituents such as Baicalin, Wogonin, Quercetin, Fisetin, Naringenin, Isoliquiritigenin, Xanthohumol, Puerarin, Icariin, and mulberry, in addition to traditional Chinese medicinal compounds such as ginkgo, continues, liquorice, and Sophora flavescens (149).",

      "text_block": "Astrocytes are important modulators of neuroplasticity since they intervene in synaptogenesis and neuronal survival. | Likewise, it has been emphasized that the balance between the neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects of astrocytes, in inflammatory brain environments, is crucial to determine resilience to depressive episodes. | At least two types of astrocytes are described: neurotoxic astrocytes (A1), which can induce neuronal death, and neurotrophic astrocytes (A2), which support neuronal survival and tissue repair. | A2 astrocytes produce neurotrophic factors such as GDNF and BDNF, as well as anti-inflammatory molecules. | Another study found that LPS exposure in mice promoted the transition of astrocytes into a neurotoxic (A1) state, also known as A1 reactive astrocytes (RAS), characterized by reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and elevated IL-1β and TNF-α levels (Wang et al., 2019). | The absence of Orai1 reduces inflammation-related Ca2 signaling and diminishes inhibitory neurotransmission in the hippocampus (Novakovic et al., 2023). | Previous studies have identified two different types of RAS: neurotoxic astrocytes (A1), which can cause neuronal death, and neurotrophic astrocytes (A2), which promote neuronal survival and tissue repair (Clarke et al., 2018; Chang et al., 2023). | Signaling through BDNF and its receptor TrkB (tropomyosin receptor kinase B) is essential for regulating neuronal survival, and structural and functional plasticity (Figure 2). | Both ERK12 and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) can translocate to the nucleus, where they phosphorylate CREB, promoting the transcription of genes involve in neuronal survival, dendritic growth, and synaptic plasticity. | By promoting the neuroprotective A2 phenotype and increasing BDNF expression, it may be possible to counteract the detrimental effects of chronic stress and depression on the brains ability to recover and achieve homeostatic regulation. | Different antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), act by restoring glial cell function and mitigating neuroinflammation. | For instance, fluoxetine has been linked to reduced IL-2 levels, and along with ketamine, it has been shown to reestablish the expression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and BDNF (Henkel et al., 2014; Kinoshita et al., 2018; Viana et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2022; Zeb et al., 2022). | Additionally, dimethyl fumarate (DMF) has been proposed as a neuroprotective agent due to its ability to reverse increased Iba1 (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1), TNF-α, and IL-1β expression, while counteracting the decrease in GFAP levels observed in CMS models (de Souza et al., 2022). | (2020) reported that anti-inflammatory agents (including Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs NSAIDs, polyunsaturated fatty acids, cytokine inhibitors, statins, corticosteroids, minocycline, pioglitazone, modafinil and N-acetylcysteine NAC) could exert antidepressant effects and impact response and remission rates in MDD patients (Bai et al., 2020). | Similarly, it has been found that patients exhibiting depressive symptoms associated with primary inflammatory disorders benefit from cytokine inhibitor treatment regardless of improvements in general physical health (Wittenberg et al., 2020). | One potential therapeutic approach could involve targeting different astrocyte states, since modulating the balance between phenotypes related to neuroprotection and those more typical of neuroinflammation responses may offer promising new strategies for treatment.",

      "text_block": "AbstractAimSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are thought to exert a clinical effect through various mechanisms, including through alteration in synaptic plasticity. | Previous work has suggested that this response can be modulated by administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.MethodThirtyone healthy volunteers received both fluoxetine 20 mg and placebo in randomly ordered sessions, followed by spaced continuous theta burst stimulation to motor cortex. | Previous results suggesting an effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on inhibitory noninvasive brain stimulation protocols may be due to insufficiently large sample sizes. | 1 INTRODUCTION Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), has been licensed since the 1980s for the treatment of depression. | 1.1 Hypotheses It was postulated that oral administration of a single dose of fluoxetine 20 mg would enhance the inhibitory effect of a spaced cTBS applied to motor cortex, measured as a reduction in the mean amplitude of the Motor Evoked Potential (MEP) over 30 min. | Individual response to cTBS was predominantly facilitatory in both sessions, with only 11 of 31 subjects showing a net inhibitory response (mean MEP 100 baseline) to cTBS in the placebo session and 10 showing inhibition in the fluoxetine session. | 5 Fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline all exert a weak effect on norepinephrine, acetylcholine, and dopamine reuptake mechanisms, 30 whereas citalopram is a much more selective 5HT reuptake inhibitor, which might conceivably be responsible for the discordant results. | 32 In their work, the inhibitory (LTDlike) effect of TDCS on MEPs was converted into a facilitatory (LTPlike) effect by citalopram. | 36 A puzzling factor in our own results was the fact that a majority of subjects in this study demonstrated a noncanonical response to cTBS, whereas typically the largest proportion of subjects shows an inhibitory effect.",

explores the therapeutic potential of filbertone, a bioactive compound found in hazelnuts, in neurodegeneration, focusing on its effects on neurotrophic factors and the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway. | In our study, filbertone markedly elevated the expression of neurotrophic factors, including BDNF, Glial cell line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (GDNF), and Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, mouse astrocyte C8-D1A cells, and mouse hypothalamus mHypoE-N1 cells. | Moreover, filbertone effectively countered neuroinflammation and reversed the decline in neurotrophic factors and Nrf2 activation induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) in neurodegeneration models. | The neuroprotective effects of filbertone were further validated in models of neurotoxicity induced by palmitic acid (PA) and the neurotoxin MPTPMPP, where it was observed to counteract PA and MPTPMPP-induced decreases in cell viability and neuroinflammation, primarily through the activation of Nrf2 and the subsequent upregulation of BDNF and heme oxygenase-1 expression. | Nrf2 deficiency negated the neuroprotective effects of filbertone in MPTP-treated mice. | Consequently, our finding suggests that filbertone is a novel therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases, enhancing neuronal resilience through the Nrf2 signaling pathway

Created with BioRender.com Discussion The presented research reveals, for the first time, the neuroprotective efficacy of triolein during the acute phase of IS. | Furthermore, our study revealed that triolein exerts an inhibitory effect on the inflammatory response and autophagy through AKTmTOR signaling pathway activation, concurrently enhancing OGDR-induced HT22 cell viability. | In the present study, autophagy inhibitor BafA1 was used to inhibit autophagy in vitro before detecting inflammation. | To clarify whether the AKTmTOR signaling pathway participates in the neuroprotective function of triolein in IS, this study selected GSK-690,693 to inhibit AKT function, followed by detecting changes in the expression of Atg and inflammatory factors and assessing OGDR-induced HT22 injury. | In both in vivo and in vitro experiments, inhibiting the AKTmTOR signaling pathway with GSK-690,693 significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of triolein on inflammation (Figs. | Overall, these results indicate the involvement of the AKTmTOR signaling pathway in the crucial function of triolein in exerting anti-inflammatory effects and inhibitory effects on autophagy in IS-induced brain injury. | Additionally, further studies of trioleins complex mechanisms are anticipated to advance the development of neuroprotective drugs to make them safer and more effective. | The prospect of triolein as an IS drug appears promising, especially given its demonstrated ability to regulate key pathways involved in neuroprotection. | Conclusion In conclusion, our study elucidates, for the first time, the neuroprotective role of triolein in IS, achieved through autophagy-dependent inhibition of the post-IS inflammatory response. | Furthermore, the neuroprotective effects of triolein are intricately linked to the AKTmTOR signaling pathway.",

      "text_block": "This study explores the neuroprotective potentials of ANQ derivatives (118) using in vitro models of AD pathology (i.e., Aβ42-induced SH-SY5Y cells). | Findings demonstrated that all compounds mitigated Aβ42-induced cellular damage by preserving cell viability and morphology. | Among all, four compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) showed potent antioxidant activities as well as abilities to minimize AD-related damages (i.e. decreasing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, preserving mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), protecting membrane damage, and modulating beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) activity) with comparable protective effects to the well-known neuroprotectant, resveratrol (RSV). | A molecular docking study indicated these compounds could suitably bind to sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) protein with preferable affinity. | Target prediction identified a list of possible AD-related targets of these compounds offering insights into their mechanisms of action and suggesting their multifunctional potentials. | Recently, the potential of low-dose BACE1 inhibitors was revealed to lower the levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 by 30, preventing the initial amyloidogenic cleavage and avoiding side effects . | Consequently, there is a renewed emphasis on developing more selective but less toxic BACE1 inhibitors used in pre-symptomatic stages in patients with AD. | But BACE1 inhibitor still showed potential as an AD therapeutic agent. | Combining with other pharmacological actions could lead to the development of effective neuroprotective agents for preventing AD progression. | NQs are well-known for their redox properties, this unique property makes them valuable templates for the discovery of numerous therapeutic agents (i.e., antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective agents). | The existing literature highlights several studies indicating that certain NQ derivatives exhibit neuroprotective effects, particularly in the context of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, key factors involved in the pathogenesis of AD . | SIRT1 is also considered a crucial player in neuroprotection due to its ability to enhance neuronal survival and functions . | Computational tools have emerged as pivotal strategies to expedite the identification of potential target proteins for novel compounds. | Molecular docking is commonly used to reveal possible binding modes and interactions of the compounds against the target , which would be beneficial for future design and optimization of the compounds. | Poor pharmacokinetics (drug-likeness) and severe toxicities of the compounds are key factors rendering the failures in drug development, especially the late-stage occurring ones. | Some compounds elicited promising anticancer activities, while most of them displayed low cytotoxicity or non-cytotoxicity to normal cell lines. | Additionally, various NQ derivatives have been shown to possess neuroprotective effects and SIRT1 activators . | Herein, these compounds were investigated for their neuroprotective effects against Aβ-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. | Furthermore, computational studies, (i.e., molecular docking, assessment of pharmacokinetics, and target prediction) were performed to uncover possible binding modes, drug-likeness of the compounds, and potential biological targets. | Investigated compounds (118) were individually dissolved in DMSO to generate concentrated stock solutions. | RSV was employed as a positive control due to its established neuroprotection and SIRT1 activator, as documented in previous literature . | Treatment regimens differed amongst groups including (i) the control group remained unexposed to ANQs (118) or Aβ42, (ii) the toxin-induced group was exposed to 1 µM Aβ42, (iii) the compound-treated group received treatment with ANQs (118) at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 µM for 24 h, (IV) the compound-pretreated group received pretreatment with ANQs (118) at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 µM for 3 h, followed by media refreshment and exposure to 1 µM Aβ42 for an additional 24 h. | In brief, either compounds at a concentration of 1 µM or cell lysate after treatment regimen were incubated with 590 mM H2O2 in 0.05 M PBS at pH 7.0 for 30 min. | Following the treatment, cell lysis was carried out in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA buffer) supplemented with protease inhibitors at 4 C for 20 min. | Cells were lysed in cold PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors at 4 C for 20 min following post-treatment. | The grid box center was positioned at -23.315, 65.890, and 14.723 to encompass the entire activator-binding site between the C-terminal and N-terminal domains of SIRT1. | Rotational bonds were defined as rigid for the protein, but flexible for the investigated compounds. | In Silico Assessment of Pharmacokinetics and Drug-Like Properties To evaluate the drug-likeness and potential toxicities of the investigated compounds, chemical structures in SMILES format were employed for the prediction using the web server tools, including SwissADME (http:www.swissadme.ch) , pkCSM (http:biosig.unimelb.edu.aupkcsm) , and ProTox-II (http:tox-new.charite.deprotox_II) . | Target Prediction For the prediction of AD-related gene targets pertaining to our investigated compounds, AD-related genes were sourced from two prominent databases, including DisGeNET with a score cutoff of 0.2 and GeneCards with a score threshold of 2.57, calculated through median determination. | Subsequently, the possible protein targets of the investigated compounds were predicted using two well-established web-based servers including SuperPred and SwissTargetPrediction . | The shared common targets were visualized as an intersected area using the VENNY 2.1 online tool (https:bioinfogp.cnb.csic.estoolsvenny) to identify a refined set of potential AD-associated targets specifically interacting with our compounds. | This intersection represents a focused list of the target proteins with a high likelihood of being involved in AD as well as a high potential to interact with the studied compounds. | These compounds possess a 1,4-NQ core structure with 2-amino or 2-amino-3-halo substituents, in which the 2-amino was substituted by phenyl ring bearing R (electron withdrawingelectron donating groups) substituents on 3- or 4-position. | SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated with various concentrations of compounds (0.1100 µM) for 24 h in the absence of Aβ42. | The results indicated that all compounds exhibited no significant effect on cell viability at minimal doses (0.11 µM). | However, some compounds demonstrated toxicity to the cells at higher concentrations (5100 µM). | The neuroprotective potential of ANQ derivatives was explored by pretreating the SH-SY5Y cells with each compound for 3 h before exposure to 1 µM Aβ42 for an additional 24 h. | Results demonstrated that 1 µM compounds significantly enhanced cell viability of the pretreated cells, specifically compound 10 (93.38 1.69), compound 12 (88.66 1.54), compound 16 (87.38 2.32), and compound 18 (88.80 2.12), compared to the cells treated with Aβ42 alone (Fig. | Notably, these compounds elicited protective effects comparable to that of the RSV, a reference compound known for its cell viability protection (87.20 1.13). | Based on the results, these four ANQs (10, 12, 16, and 18) at a concentration of 1 µM were selected for further explorations to elucidate potential neuroprotective mechanisms. | Scale bar 200 μm ANQs Did Not Alter Cellular Morphology Bright-field microscopy revealed the protective effects of the selected compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) against Aβ42-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. | Particularly, the co-incubation of H2O2 with these compounds significantly decreased the reduction rate of KMnO4 by 70 compared to that of the H2O2 alone (Fig. | Furthermore, the antioxidant effect of these compounds on the induction of catalase-like activity was investigated in cell lysates following the designated treatments. | Interestingly, pretreatment with the tested compounds significantly increased catalase-like activity compared to the cells solely exposed to 1 µM Aβ42 for 24 h, as observed in the decreased H2O2 concentration after incubating with the cell lysate (Fig. | (A) Percentage of H2O2 reductance from selected compounds (1 µM). | P 0.05 compared to the control cells; P 0.05 compared to the Aβ42 group ANQs Diminished Intracellular ROS Generation Against Aβ42-Treated Cells The effect of selected compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) on intracellular ROS generation was evaluated using the DCFDA fluorescent probe. | Conversely, pretreatment with 1 µM of compounds 10, 12, 16, 18, or RSV for 3 h prior to Aβ42 exposure significantly reduced ROS accumulation. | This was evident by a decrease in DCFDA fluorescence intensity compared to the control group (compounds 10: 109.70 0.74, 12: 109.54 0.95, 16: 111.16 0.97, 18: 106.87 1.13, and RSV: 109.22 1.65). | MMP Maintained by ANQs Pretreatment The protective potential of selected compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) against mitochondrial dysfunction was investigated by assessing the fluorescent signal emitted from the rhodamine-123 dye. | Nevertheless, pretreatment with 1 µM of compounds 10, 12, 16, 18, or RSV significantly preserved the MMP by 95.24 2.32, 94.05 1.20, 94.41 1.77, 93.52 2.01, and 94.94 1.09, respectively, compared to the control group. | This suggested the remarkable ability of the compounds to safeguard the mitochondrial function from Aβ42-mediated neurotoxicity. | Importantly, pretreatment with 1 µM of tested compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) or RSV significantly counteracted this Aβ42-induced LDH release as observed by the reduction in LDH release to near-control levels (compounds 10: 106.24 1.66, 12: 106.36 1.29, 16: 108.44 1.89, 18: 106.73 1.62, and RSV: 103.35 1.95). | The results showed the membrane-protective properties of these ANQs, which could potentially contribute to their neuroprotective abilities. | Interestingly, the compounds showed comparable effects with those observed for RSV, which maintained BACE1 activity at 111.67 8.16. | The compounds showed similar effects with those observed for RSV, a well-known SIRT1 activator, which exhibited sustained SIRT1 activity up to 88.32 3.23. | P 0.05 compared to the control; P 0.05 compared to the Aβ42 group Binding Interaction of ANQs in SIRT1 Molecular docking was conducted to elucidate potential binding modes of the selected compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) toward the target protein, SIRT1 (PDB code 5BTR). | This protein structure was selected due to its sufficient resolution and the co-crystallized RSV, a well-known SIRT1 activator, which was used as a reference compound for validation of docking protocol to provide reliable details and binding characteristics necessary for accurate molecular docking. | Subsequently, the validated protocol was utilized to explore the binding modes of the studied compounds. | Docking simulations of the studied compounds showed that all investigated compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) could suitably bind within the same activator-binding site of SIRT1 in similar manners to those of RSVs, Fig. | However, docking algorithms often favor larger compounds because they can form more atomic interactions within the binding site, leading to molecular weight bias in the docking scores. | Since our compounds are larger than RSV, this bias could result in an overemphasis on their binding affinities. | To address this, we evaluated additional factors such as interacted amino acid and type of interactions to ensure that the observed binding affinities are not solely a result of molecular size but reflect interactions between the compounds and SIRT1. | Among three RSV molecules, RSV2 served as a reference model due to its lowest binding free energy among others and its close spatial proximity to the studied compounds. | The studied compounds were found to share some key interacting amino acid residues with RSV2 (i.e., ILE223 and ASN226). | Notably, the NQ core skeleton and the substituted phenyl ring presented in the compounds could mimic the two phenyl rings of the RSV by playing parts in the formations of pi-alkyl and pi-sigma interactions. | However, conventional hydrogen bonding with THR209 residue observed in the binding of RSV was not observed in any studied compounds. | 7Possible binding modes and ligand-protein interactions of the selected ANQs (10, 12, 16, and 18) against the SIRT1 activator-binding site. | (A) Three-dimensional (3D)

interaction In Silico Predictions of Pharmacokinetics and Drug-Likeness of ANQs A comprehensive prediction of pharmacokinetics of the selected compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) was conducted employing three established web-based tools (i.e., SwissADME, pkCSM, and ProTox-II) as provided in Table 1. | The results indicated that all compounds are drug-like molecules, as shown by the criteria of Lipinskis, Vebers, and Ghoses rules. | The compounds exhibited favorable water solubility, optimal lipophilicity (log P 5), as well as high intestinal absorption (91.9294.58) for oral administration. | Additionally, these compounds provided moderate drug distribution potential (human VDss of 0.150.23 log Lkg) as well as moderate CNS and BBB permeabilities, which suggested their abilities to reach the target site in the CNS. | For metabolic considerations, all compounds were identified as substrates of CYP3A4, a major cytochrome P450 enzyme responsible for metabolizing over 90 of available drugs. | Furthermore, they were predicted as inhibitors of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, or CYP2C9, which implicated an alternative metabolic fate and potential drug-drug interactions. | In terms of drug elimination and toxicity predictions, the studied compounds were predicted to exhibit total clearance ranging from 0.018 to 0.186 log mLminkg. | All of them, except for compound 12, were also identified as substrates of the renal OCT2. | Regarding toxicity, all compounds were classified as moderately hazardous with potential for hepatotoxicity, carcinogenicity, immunogenicity, and mutagenicity. | Table 1Predictions of physicochemical characteristics, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity profiles of the selected compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18)aCompound10121618Physicochemical

series of 18 ANQ derivatives (118) was comprehensively investigated for neuroprotective potentials to reveal their multifaceted effects in combating Aβ42-induced cellular damage in SH-SY5Y cells. | Cell viability indicated that the tested compounds elicited a dose-dependent effect on neuronal cell survival. | All compounds are non-cytotoxic at low concentrations (0.11 µM), but some of them showed toxicity at higher concentrations (5100 µM). | It was shown that pretreatment with 1 µM of compounds (118) enhanced cell viability of the Aβ42-induced cells. | However, only four compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) demonstrated promising protective effects comparable to that of the RSV (Fig. | The selected compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) effectively protected the cells against Aβ42-induced cellular and membrane damages as shown by preserved normal cellular morphology (Fig. | These findings suggested the potential of compounds in stabilizing the cell membranes, preventing membrane leakage, and preserving cellular integrity. | Furthermore, the compounds effectively protected against Aβ42-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction as demonstrated by preserved MMP, a key indicator of mitochondrial health and function (Fig. | This protective property suggested that the compounds may prevent energetic deficits and maintain crucial cellular processes required for neuronal survival. | The selected compounds demonstrated abilities to counteract the Aβ42-induced oxidative stress as shown by their potent antioxidant capacities and abilities to diminish intracellular ROS levels (Fig. | Additionally, these compounds not only directly scavenge the ROS, but also significantly enhance cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms by increasing catalase-like activity (Fig. | This dual antioxidant action suggested their promising potentials as disease-modifying neuroprotective agents. | In view of chemical structure and activity relationship (SAR) of the compounds, notable differences between active and inactive compounds were observed. | As observed for compounds 4 and 10, and compounds 1 and 12, which have the same electron withdrawing groups but different positions of NO2 and COCH3, respectively. | Only compounds 10 and 12 demonstrated neuroprotective effects. | This could be due to such property of functional groups at meta-position may be required for appropriate interaction with the site of neuroprotective action. | These observations emphasize that types and substitution patterns of R substituents can significantly impact biological activity, guiding further structural optimization to enhance neuroprotective properties. | In-depth neuroprotective mechanisms of these compounds were demonstrated by their modulating effects on BACE1 and SIRT1 activities. | BACE1 activity is normally found to increase in AD conditions, however, pretreatment with the selected compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) showed an effective decrease of BACE1 activity in the Aβ42-induced cells (Fig. | SIRT1 is well-known to play roles in neuroprotection via modulating several key neurodegeneration-related pathways such as decreasing the generation and aggregation of misfolded proteins (Aβ) and inhibiting the transcription of the BACE1 gene, resulting in a decline in BACE1 activity . | Particularly, the selected compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) promisingly preserved SIRT1 activity with comparable potency to that of the RSV, the known SIRT1 activator (Fig. | This was supported by a molecular docking study which indicated that these compounds could suitably bind within the activator-binding site of the SIRT1 target in a similar manner with RSV as demonstrated by shared key interacting amino acid residues (i.e., ILE223 and ASN226). | The bindings of these compounds were dominated by pi-interactions formed between the NQ core or substituted phenyl ring of the compounds and SIRT1. | Additionally, these compounds showed superior binding affinity towards the SIRT1 as indicated by their lower binding free energy values (compounds from 10.47 to 9.34 kcalmol and RSV 7.51 kcalmol) (Fig. | Therefore, in silico analysis was used to predict various potential targets associated with our investigated compounds, aiming to identify broader neuroprotective mechanisms, which were highlighted in a list of the top 20 potential AD-associated target proteins (Table 2). | Accordingly, investigated compounds may be able to modulate the Aβ-induced neuroinflammatory response by targeting Src family kinases . | This suggested that our compounds could be further developed for modulating pro-inflammatory cascades to combat neuroinflammation. | This finding together with our in vitro results potentially suggested a unifying mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effects of the studied ANQs through the downstream targets of SIRT1. | Taken together, the findings highlighted that the ANQs are promising compounds to be further developed as multifunctional neuroprotective agents to combat the multifaceted pathogenesis of AD. | In silico predictions demonstrated that all four compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) are drug-like compounds with favorable pharmacokinetics for potential oral administration (Table 1). | However, all compounds are CYP3A4 substrates and some of them are inhibitors of other CYPs. This raised the concerning issue regarding their drug-drug or food-drug interaction potentials and further investigations are recommended. | Although these compounds were predicted as moderately hazardous, it is suggested that in vitro and in vivo studies on hepatotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and other toxic issues should be further investigated. | Conclusion A series of 18 ANQ derivatives were comprehensively investigated for their neuroprotective potentials against AD in the Aβ42-induced SH-SY5Y cells. | Among all tested compounds, four compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) at 1 µM were selected for further experiments due to their promising protective effects comparable to that of the RSV (84.61). | The structural features of these compounds are NQs with 2-aminophenyl containing R substituents (3-NO2, 3-COCH3, and 4-CH3)-3-chloro groups as noted for compounds 10, 12, 16, and R 4-OCH3 for compound 18. | Furthermore, the compounds effectively modulated BACE1 and SIRT1 activities, which highlighted the potential for the reduction of Aβ42 accumulation and other key harmful events. | This was supported by the molecular docking study, which showed that these compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) are potential SIRT1 activators. | Target prediction indicated a top-ranked list of possible AD-related targets of these compounds, which demonstrated their potentials for combating the complexing of the disease in multiple facets (i.e., neuroinflammation, neuronal cell death, and misfolded proteins) under the SIRT1 regulation. | Additionally, predictions of pharmacokinetics and toxicity profiles suggested that these compounds are drug-like molecules with CNS-penetrating ability as well as good intestinal absorption. | Taken together, these ANQ compounds are promising candidates for further development as oral disease-modifying agents for the management of AD.",

action and suggesting their multifunctional potentials. | Recently, the potential of low-dose BACE1 inhibitors was revealed to lower the levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 by 30, preventing the initial amyloidogenic cleavage and avoiding side effects . | Consequently, there is a renewed emphasis on developing more selective but less toxic BACE1 inhibitors used in pre-symptomatic stages in patients with AD. | But BACE1 inhibitor still showed potential as an AD therapeutic agent. | Combining with other pharmacological actions could lead to the development of effective neuroprotective agents for preventing AD progression. | NQs are well-known for their redox properties, this unique property makes them valuable templates for the discovery of numerous therapeutic agents (i.e., antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective agents). | The existing literature highlights several studies indicating that certain NQ derivatives exhibit neuroprotective effects, particularly in the context of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, key factors involved in the pathogenesis of AD . | SIRT1 is also considered a crucial player in neuroprotection due to its ability to enhance neuronal survival and functions . | Computational tools have emerged as pivotal strategies to expedite the identification of potential target proteins for novel compounds. | Molecular docking is commonly used to reveal possible binding modes and interactions of the compounds against the target , which would be beneficial for future design and optimization of the compounds. | Poor pharmacokinetics (drug-likeness) and severe toxicities of the compounds are key factors rendering the failures in drug development, especially the late-stage occurring ones. | Some compounds elicited promising anticancer activities, while most of them displayed low cytotoxicity or non-cytotoxicity to normal cell lines. | Additionally, various NQ derivatives have been shown to possess neuroprotective effects and SIRT1 activators . | Herein, these compounds were investigated for their neuroprotective effects against Aβ-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. | Furthermore, computational studies, (i.e., molecular docking, assessment of pharmacokinetics, and target prediction) were performed to uncover possible binding modes, drug-likeness of the compounds, and potential biological targets. | Investigated compounds (118) were individually dissolved in DMSO to generate concentrated stock solutions. | RSV was employed as a positive control due to its established neuroprotection and SIRT1 activator, as documented in previous literature . | Treatment regimens differed amongst groups including (i) the control group remained unexposed to ANQs (118) or Aβ42, (ii) the toxin-induced group was exposed to 1 µM Aβ42, (iii) the compound-treated group received treatment with ANQs (118) at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 µM for 24 h, (IV) the compound-pretreated group received pretreatment with ANQs (118) at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 µM for 3 h, followed by media refreshment and exposure to 1 µM Aβ42 for an additional 24 h. | In brief, either compounds at a concentration of 1 µM or cell lysate after treatment regimen were incubated with 590 mM H2O2 in 0.05 M PBS at pH 7.0 for 30 min. | Following the treatment, cell lysis was carried out in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA buffer) supplemented with protease inhibitors at 4 C for 20 min. | Cells were lysed in cold PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors at 4 C for 20 min following post-treatment. | The grid box center was positioned at -23.315, 65.890, and 14.723 to encompass the entire activator-binding site between the C-terminal and N-terminal domains of SIRT1. | Rotational bonds were defined as rigid for the protein, but flexible for the investigated compounds. | In Silico Assessment of Pharmacokinetics and Drug-Like Properties To evaluate the drug-likeness and potential toxicities of the investigated compounds, chemical structures in SMILES format were employed for the prediction using the web server tools, including SwissADME (http:www.swissadme.ch) , pkCSM (http:biosig.unimelb.edu.aupkcsm) , and ProTox-II (http:tox-new.charite.deprotox_II) . | Target Prediction For the prediction of AD-related gene targets pertaining to our investigated compounds, AD-related genes were sourced from two prominent databases, including DisGeNET with a score cutoff of 0.2 and GeneCards with a score threshold of 2.57, calculated through median determination. | Subsequently, the possible protein targets of the investigated compounds were predicted using two well-established web-based servers including SuperPred and SwissTargetPrediction . | The shared common targets were visualized as an intersected area using the VENNY 2.1 online tool (https:bioinfogp.cnb.csic.estoolsvenny) to identify a refined set of potential AD-associated targets specifically interacting with our compounds. | This intersection represents a focused list of the target proteins with a high likelihood of being involved in AD as well as a high potential to interact with the studied compounds. | These compounds possess a 1,4-NQ core structure with 2-amino or 2-amino-3-halo substituents, in which the 2-amino was substituted by phenyl ring bearing R (electron withdrawingelectron donating groups) substituents on 3- or 4-position. | SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated with various concentrations of compounds (0.1100 µM) for 24 h in the absence of Aβ42. | The results indicated that all compounds exhibited no significant effect on cell viability at minimal doses (0.11 µM). | However, some compounds demonstrated toxicity to the cells at higher concentrations (5100 µM). | The neuroprotective potential of ANQ derivatives was explored by pretreating the SH-SY5Y cells with each compound for 3 h before exposure to 1 µM Aβ42 for an additional 24 h. | Results demonstrated that 1 µM compounds significantly enhanced cell viability of the pretreated cells, specifically compound 10 (93.38 1.69), compound 12 (88.66 1.54), compound 16 (87.38 2.32), and compound 18 (88.80 2.12), compared to the cells treated with Aβ42 alone (Fig. | Notably, these compounds elicited protective effects comparable to that of the RSV, a reference compound known for its cell viability protection (87.20 1.13). | Based on the results, these four ANQs (10, 12, 16, and 18) at a concentration of 1 µM were selected for further explorations to elucidate potential neuroprotective mechanisms. | Scale bar 200 μm ANQs Did Not Alter Cellular Morphology Bright-field microscopy revealed the protective effects of the selected compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) against Aβ42-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. | Particularly, the co-incubation of H2O2 with these compounds significantly decreased the reduction rate of KMnO4 by 70 compared to that of the H2O2 alone (Fig. | Furthermore, the antioxidant effect of these compounds on the induction of catalase-like activity was investigated in cell lysates following the designated treatments. | Interestingly, pretreatment with the tested compounds significantly increased catalase-like activity compared to the cells solely exposed to 1 µM Aβ42 for 24 h, as observed in the decreased H2O2 concentration after incubating with the cell lysate (Fig. | (A) Percentage of H2O2 reductance from selected compounds (1 µM). | P 0.05 compared to the control cells; P 0.05 compared to the Aβ42 group ANQs Diminished Intracellular ROS Generation Against Aβ42-Treated Cells The effect of selected compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) on intracellular ROS generation was evaluated using the DCFDA fluorescent probe. | Conversely, pretreatment with 1 µM of compounds 10, 12, 16, 18, or RSV for 3 h prior to Aβ42 exposure significantly reduced ROS accumulation. | This was evident by a decrease in DCFDA fluorescence intensity compared to the control group (compounds 10: 109.70 0.74, 12: 109.54 0.95, 16: 111.16 0.97, 18: 106.87 1.13, and RSV: 109.22 1.65). | MMP Maintained by ANQs Pretreatment The protective potential of selected compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) against mitochondrial dysfunction was investigated by assessing the fluorescent signal emitted from the rhodamine-123 dye. | Nevertheless, pretreatment with 1 µM of compounds 10, 12, 16, 18, or RSV significantly preserved the MMP by 95.24 2.32, 94.05 1.20, 94.41 1.77, 93.52 2.01, and 94.94 1.09, respectively, compared to the control group. | This suggested the remarkable ability of the compounds to safeguard the mitochondrial function from Aβ42-mediated neurotoxicity. | Importantly, pretreatment with 1 µM of tested compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) or RSV significantly counteracted this Aβ42-induced LDH release as observed by the reduction in LDH release to near-control levels (compounds 10: 106.24 1.66, 12: 106.36 1.29, 16: 108.44 1.89, 18: 106.73 1.62, and RSV: 103.35 1.95). | The results showed the membrane-protective properties of these ANQs, which could potentially contribute to their neuroprotective abilities. | Interestingly, the compounds showed comparable effects with those observed for RSV, which maintained BACE1 activity at 111.67 8.16. | The compounds showed similar effects with those observed for RSV, a well-known SIRT1 activator, which exhibited sustained SIRT1 activity up to 88.32 3.23. | P 0.05 compared to the control; P 0.05 compared to the Aβ42 group Binding Interaction of ANQs in SIRT1 Molecular docking was conducted to elucidate potential binding modes of the selected compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) toward the target protein, SIRT1 (PDB code 5BTR). | This protein structure was selected due to its sufficient resolution and the co-crystallized RSV, a well-known SIRT1 activator, which was used as a reference compound for validation of docking protocol to provide reliable details and binding characteristics necessary for accurate molecular docking. | Subsequently, the validated protocol was utilized to explore the binding modes of the studied compounds. | Docking simulations of the studied compounds showed that all investigated compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) could suitably bind within the same activator-binding site of SIRT1 in similar manners to those of RSVs, Fig. | However, docking algorithms often favor larger compounds because they can form more atomic interactions within the binding site, leading to molecular weight bias in the docking scores. | Since our compounds are larger than RSV, this bias could result in an overemphasis on their binding affinities. | To address this, we evaluated additional factors such as interacted amino acid and type of interactions to ensure that the observed binding affinities are not solely a result of molecular size but reflect interactions between the compounds and SIRT1. | Among three RSV molecules, RSV2 served as a reference model due to its lowest binding free energy among others and its close spatial proximity to the studied compounds. | The studied compounds were found to share some key interacting amino acid residues with RSV2 (i.e., ILE223 and ASN226). | Notably, the NQ core skeleton and the substituted phenyl ring presented in the compounds could mimic the two phenyl rings of the RSV by playing parts in the formations of pi-alkyl and pi-sigma interactions. | However, conventional hydrogen bonding with THR209 residue observed in the binding of RSV was not observed in any studied compounds. | 7Possible binding modes and ligand-protein interactions of the selected ANQs (10, 12, 16, and 18) against the SIRT1 activator-binding site. | (A) Three-dimensional (3D)

interaction In Silico Predictions of Pharmacokinetics and Drug-Likeness of ANQs A comprehensive prediction of pharmacokinetics of the selected compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) was conducted employing three established web-based tools (i.e., SwissADME, pkCSM, and ProTox-II) as provided in Table 1. | The results indicated that all compounds are drug-like molecules, as shown by the criteria of Lipinskis, Vebers, and Ghoses rules. | The compounds exhibited favorable water solubility, optimal lipophilicity (log P 5), as well as high intestinal absorption (91.9294.58) for oral administration. | Additionally, these compounds provided moderate drug distribution potential (human VDss of 0.150.23 log Lkg) as well as moderate CNS and BBB permeabilities, which suggested their abilities to reach the target site in the CNS. | For metabolic considerations, all compounds were identified as substrates of CYP3A4, a major cytochrome P450 enzyme responsible for metabolizing over 90 of available drugs. | Furthermore, they were predicted as inhibitors of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, or CYP2C9, which implicated an alternative metabolic fate and potential drug-drug interactions. | In terms of drug elimination and toxicity predictions, the studied compounds were predicted to exhibit total clearance ranging from 0.018 to 0.186 log mLminkg. | All of them, except for compound 12, were also identified as substrates of the renal OCT2. | Regarding toxicity, all compounds were classified as moderately hazardous with potential for hepatotoxicity, carcinogenicity, immunogenicity, and mutagenicity. | Table 1Predictions of physicochemical characteristics, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity profiles of the selected compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18)aCompound10121618Physicochemical

series of 18 ANQ derivatives (118) was comprehensively investigated for neuroprotective potentials to reveal their multifaceted effects in combating Aβ42-induced cellular damage in SH-SY5Y cells. | Cell viability indicated that the tested compounds elicited a dose-dependent effect on neuronal cell survival. | All compounds are non-cytotoxic at low concentrations (0.11 µM), but some of them showed toxicity at higher concentrations (5100 µM). | It was shown that pretreatment with 1 µM of compounds (118) enhanced cell viability of the Aβ42-induced cells. | However, only four compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) demonstrated promising protective effects comparable to that of the RSV (Fig. | The selected compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) effectively protected the cells against Aβ42-induced cellular and membrane damages as shown by preserved normal cellular morphology (Fig. | These findings suggested the potential of compounds in stabilizing the cell membranes, preventing membrane leakage, and preserving cellular integrity. | Furthermore, the compounds effectively protected against Aβ42-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction as demonstrated by preserved MMP, a key indicator of mitochondrial health and function (Fig. | This protective property suggested that the compounds may prevent energetic deficits and maintain crucial cellular processes required for neuronal survival. | The selected compounds demonstrated abilities to counteract the Aβ42-induced oxidative stress as shown by their potent antioxidant capacities and abilities to diminish intracellular ROS levels (Fig. | Additionally, these compounds not only directly scavenge the ROS, but also significantly enhance cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms by increasing catalase-like activity (Fig. | This dual antioxidant action suggested their promising potentials as disease-modifying neuroprotective agents. | In view of chemical structure and activity relationship (SAR) of the compounds, notable differences between active and inactive compounds were observed. | As observed for compounds 4 and 10, and compounds 1 and 12, which have the same electron withdrawing groups but different positions of NO2 and COCH3, respectively. | Only compounds 10 and 12 demonstrated neuroprotective effects. | This could be due to such property of functional groups at meta-position may be required for appropriate interaction with the site of neuroprotective action. | These observations emphasize that types and substitution patterns of R substituents can significantly impact biological activity, guiding further structural optimization to enhance neuroprotective properties. | In-depth neuroprotective mechanisms of these compounds were demonstrated by their modulating effects on BACE1 and SIRT1 activities. | BACE1 activity is normally found to increase in AD conditions, however, pretreatment with the selected compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) showed an effective decrease of BACE1 activity in the Aβ42-induced cells (Fig. | SIRT1 is well-known to play roles in neuroprotection via modulating several key neurodegeneration-related pathways such as decreasing the generation and aggregation of misfolded proteins (Aβ) and inhibiting the transcription of the BACE1 gene, resulting in a decline in BACE1 activity . | Particularly, the selected compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) promisingly preserved SIRT1 activity with comparable potency to that of the RSV, the known SIRT1 activator (Fig. | This was supported by a molecular docking study which indicated that these compounds could suitably bind within the activator-binding site of the SIRT1 target in a similar manner with RSV as demonstrated by shared key interacting amino acid residues (i.e., ILE223 and ASN226). | The bindings of these compounds were dominated by pi-interactions formed between the NQ core or substituted phenyl ring of the compounds and SIRT1. | Additionally, these compounds showed superior binding affinity towards the SIRT1 as indicated by their lower binding free energy values (compounds from 10.47 to 9.34 kcalmol and RSV 7.51 kcalmol) (Fig. | Therefore, in silico analysis was used to predict various potential targets associated with our investigated compounds, aiming to identify broader neuroprotective mechanisms, which were highlighted in a list of the top 20 potential AD-associated target proteins (Table 2). | Accordingly, investigated compounds may be able to modulate the Aβ-induced neuroinflammatory response by targeting Src family kinases . | This suggested that our compounds could be further developed for modulating pro-inflammatory cascades to combat neuroinflammation. | This finding together with our in vitro results potentially suggested a unifying mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effects of the studied ANQs through the downstream targets of SIRT1. | Taken together, the findings highlighted that the ANQs are promising compounds to be further developed as multifunctional neuroprotective agents to combat the multifaceted pathogenesis of AD. | In silico predictions demonstrated that all four compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) are drug-like compounds with favorable pharmacokinetics for potential oral administration (Table 1). | However, all compounds are CYP3A4 substrates and some of them are inhibitors of other CYPs. This raised the concerning issue regarding their drug-drug or food-drug interaction potentials and further investigations are recommended. | Although these compounds were predicted as moderately hazardous, it is suggested that in vitro and in vivo studies on hepatotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and other toxic issues should be further investigated. | Conclusion A series of 18 ANQ derivatives were comprehensively investigated for their neuroprotective potentials against AD in the Aβ42-induced SH-SY5Y cells. | Among all tested compounds, four compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) at 1 µM were selected for further experiments due to their promising protective effects comparable to that of the RSV (84.61). | The structural features of these compounds are NQs with 2-aminophenyl containing R substituents (3-NO2, 3-COCH3, and 4-CH3)-3-chloro groups as noted for compounds 10, 12, 16, and R 4-OCH3 for compound 18. | Furthermore, the compounds effectively modulated BACE1 and SIRT1 activities, which highlighted the potential for the reduction of Aβ42 accumulation and other key harmful events. | This was supported by the molecular docking study, which showed that these compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) are potential SIRT1 activators. | Target prediction indicated a top-ranked list of possible AD-related targets of these compounds, which demonstrated their potentials for combating the complexing of the disease in multiple facets (i.e., neuroinflammation, neuronal cell death, and misfolded proteins) under the SIRT1 regulation. | Additionally, predictions of pharmacokinetics and toxicity profiles suggested that these compounds are drug-like molecules with CNS-penetrating ability as well as good intestinal absorption. | Taken together, these ANQ compounds are promising candidates for further development as oral disease-modifying agents for the management of AD.",

      "text_block": "Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) like donepezil are well-established for alleviating AD symptoms. | The cholinergic hypothesis suggests that the loss of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain and the subsequent decrease in central cholinergic transmission are central to the disease, it proposes that cognitive decline in AD is primarily due to impaired cholinergic signaling within the brain, resulting from a reduction in acetylcholine (ACh) levels and disrupted cholinergic pathways.3 Among the treatments approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) such as donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine are known to slow disease progression and offer neuroprotective benefits. | In rodent models, donepezil has been shown to improve cognitive function,4,5 elevate brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels,6,7 reduce Aβ buildup,8 support neurogenesis, and restore synaptic density.8 However, the long-term effectiveness of donepezil in severe AD cases remains debated. | Our previous studies revealed that neural stem cells (NSCs) engineered to overexpress brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF-NSCs) could offer a new therapeutic approach for AD.10 Additionally, we found that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) can mobilize bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) to boost neurogenesis in an AD mouse model.11 These results underscore the critical role of neurogenesis in stem cell-based therapies for AD and the need for further strategies to maintain this neurogenic effect for effective treatment development. | Consequently, we propose that combining cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) therapy with stem cell transplantation might create a synergistic effect in AD treatment, potentially improving behavioral outcomes and reducing synaptic loss in an AD mouse model. | Detection was carried out using primary antibodies against PSD95, synaptophysin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (GeneTex GTX17884), and β-actin (Sigma A5316). | To determine the impact of combining cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) treatment with stem cell transplantation in Alzheimers disease (AD) mice, we first evaluated spatial memory in AD mice post-treatment using the Morris water maze task. | Furthermore, donepezil treatment elevated both ACh and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in these neurons (Figure 3B and C). | (C) ELISA results showing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the culture medium from primary neurons with or without donepezil treatment. | Previous studies have shown that donepezil can increase levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and restore synaptic density,68,26 which are important for mitigating AD-related pathogenesis. | BDNF is vital for synaptic plasticity, neuronal survival, differentiation, and learningmemory processes.27 It also has neuroprotective properties, helping neurons resist Aβ toxicity and reducing Aβ deposition via the APOE receptor SORL1.28 Additionally, BDNF supports neurite outgrowth and synaptic plasticity.29 Given its role in synaptic plasticity, which is closely linked to AD progression and is reversible and dynamic,3032 BDNFs involvement in restoring synaptic density and cognitive function suggests that it is a key player in the combined therapeutic effects of donepezil and NSC transplantation.",

      "text_block": "Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) like donepezil are well-established for alleviating AD symptoms. | The cholinergic hypothesis suggests that the loss of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain and the subsequent decrease in central cholinergic transmission are central to the disease, it proposes that cognitive decline in AD is primarily due to impaired cholinergic signaling within the brain, resulting from a reduction in acetylcholine (ACh) levels and disrupted cholinergic pathways.3 Among the treatments approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) such as donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine are known to slow disease progression and offer neuroprotective benefits. | In rodent models, donepezil has been shown to improve cognitive function,4,5 elevate brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels,6,7 reduce Aβ buildup,8 support neurogenesis, and restore synaptic density.8 However, the long-term effectiveness of donepezil in severe AD cases remains debated. | Our previous studies revealed that neural stem cells (NSCs) engineered to overexpress brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF-NSCs) could offer a new therapeutic approach for AD.10 Additionally, we found that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) can mobilize bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) to boost neurogenesis in an AD mouse model.11 These results underscore the critical role of neurogenesis in stem cell-based therapies for AD and the need for further strategies to maintain this neurogenic effect for effective treatment development. | Consequently, we propose that combining cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) therapy with stem cell transplantation might create a synergistic effect in AD treatment, potentially improving behavioral outcomes and reducing synaptic loss in an AD mouse model. | Detection was carried out using primary antibodies against PSD95, synaptophysin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (GeneTex GTX17884), and β-actin (Sigma A5316). | To determine the impact of combining cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) treatment with stem cell transplantation in Alzheimers disease (AD) mice, we first evaluated spatial memory in AD mice post-treatment using the Morris water maze task. | Furthermore, donepezil treatment elevated both ACh and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in these neurons (Figure 3B and C). | (C) ELISA results showing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the culture medium from primary neurons with or without donepezil treatment. | Previous studies have shown that donepezil can increase levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and restore synaptic density,68,26 which are important for mitigating AD-related pathogenesis. | BDNF is vital for synaptic plasticity, neuronal survival, differentiation, and learningmemory processes.27 It also has neuroprotective properties, helping neurons resist Aβ toxicity and reducing Aβ deposition via the APOE receptor SORL1.28 Additionally, BDNF supports neurite outgrowth and synaptic plasticity.29 Given its role in synaptic plasticity, which is closely linked to AD progression and is reversible and dynamic,3032 BDNFs involvement in restoring synaptic density and cognitive function suggests that it is a key player in the combined therapeutic effects of donepezil and NSC transplantation.",

SH-SY5Y cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide. | The protective effects of STAT3 inhibitors were significantly reduced in the presence of the ERK inhibitor PD98059, underscoring the importance of the ERKCREB axis in neuroprotection. | We observed that STAT3 inhibitors promote CREB phosphorylation, leading to the upregulation of immediate early genes such as c-Fos, c-Jun, Arc, Egr-1, NR4A1, and Homer1a, as well as BDNF. | Our results highlight the potential of STAT3 inhibitors to counteract oxidative stress and enhance cognitive functions by modulating the ERKCREB signaling pathway. | Activated CREB promotes the expression of immediate-early genes (IEGs) such as c-Fos, early growth response gene-1 (Egr-1), and activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc), as well as target genes like brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), thereby contributing to the formation, consolidation, and enhancement of synaptic plasticity and LTM . | BDNF, the most widely distributed

microglial activation and neuroinflammation, characteristic of AD pathophysiology, but also reduces beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) protein levels . | Additionally, the loss of STAT3 in reactive astrocytes and systemic treatment with a STAT3 inhibitor contribute to the restoration of cerebral network function, providing protection against spatial memory and learning impairments and improving cognitive decline . | Treatment with a specific STAT3 inhibitor has demonstrated a reduction in neuroinflammatory plaques, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation in experimental animal models of AD, leading to improved cognitive function and a protective effect on neurovascular function . | Therefore, further research is needed to explore the potential therapeutic use of STAT3 inhibitors in AD. | This study investigates the neuroprotective potential of STAT3 inhibition in reducing oxidative stress-induced neuronal damage and apoptosis, key drivers in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases like AD. | Our findings demonstrate that STAT3 inhibitors effectively mitigate oxidative damage and apoptosis by activating CREB via the ERK signaling pathway, a crucial mechanism for reducing cell death. | Blocking this pathway with an ERK inhibitor abolished the protective effects of STAT3 inhibition, underscoring the central

of 250 nM, simultaneous with H2O2 treatment. | Thus, this study aimed to investigate whether a STAT3 inhibitor exerts protective effects against cell damage and death induced by H2O2 exposure. | To inhibit STAT3, we utilized a small-molecule inhibitor targeting STAT3 activation. | This included the JAK2 inhibitors AG490 and Nifuroxazide, along with STAT3 selective inhibitors such as Stattic and ODZ10117. | First, we examined whether the STAT3 inhibitor had a protective effect against the increased cell apoptosis induced by H2O2. | SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated with the STAT3 inhibitor for 12

cell appearance (Fig. | Furthermore, H2O2 treatment increased cell toxicity, but the STAT3 inhibitor treatment considerably reduced this increase in cell toxicity (Fig. | This indicates that the STAT3 inhibitor protects cells from cell damage caused by H2O2, thereby increasing cell survival rates. | To validate the protective effects of the STAT3 inhibitor against oxidative stress, intracellular ROS levels were measured using CellROX Green Reagent as an indicator of oxidative damage. | However, pretreatment with the STAT3 inhibitor significantly reduced ROS levels, indicating that the inhibitor effectively mitigates oxidative stress (Fig. | Collectively, these findings suggest that STAT3 inhibition exerts neuroprotective effects by alleviating oxidative stress and promoting cell survival in neuronal cells.Fig. | 1STAT3 inhibitor alleviates H2O2-induced oxidative damage and enhances cell viability. | In response to H2O2 treatment, the proportion of Annexin V-positive cells increased, but the presence of the STAT3 inhibitor significantly reduced the apoptotic cell rate (Fig. | Additionally, H2O2 treatment increased caspase-dependent apoptosis, as indicated by a significant rise in caspase-3, caspase-9, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, which was alleviated by the STAT3 inhibitor treatment (Fig. | In summary, this study demonstrates that a STAT3 inhibitor exerts protective effects against H2O2-induced cell damage and apoptosis. | 2STAT3 inhibitor reduces H2O2-induced apoptosis and decreases caspase activation. | Treatment with STAT3 inhibitors elicits rapid phosphorylation of CREB, resulting in a noticeable increase in p-CREB within 3 h of treatment. | The observed changes in p-CREB levels in response to STAT3 inhibitors closely correspond to the suppression patterns of p-STAT3, demonstrating a coherent link between the inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation and subsequent regulation of CREB phosphorylation. | Initially, we examined the effects of STAT3 inhibitors on ERK and Akt phosphorylation. | Treatment with STAT3 inhibitors triggered the activation of ERK and Akt (Fig. | Consistent with the observed changes in p-CREB following STAT3 inhibitor treatment, the levels of p-ERK and p-Akt induced by AG490 and Nifuroxazide gradually increased over time (Fig. | To elucidate this, we assessed the phosphorylation status of CREB induced by STAT3 inhibitors in the presence or absence of the MEKERK inhibitor PD98059 or the PI3KAkt inhibitor LY294002. | The phosphorylation of CREB induced by STAT3 inhibitors was significantly diminished in the presence of PD98059 (Fig. | In contrast, the co-treatment of STAT3 inhibitors and the Akt inhibitor led to a further enhancement in CREB phosphorylation compared to the

      "text_block": "However, the mechanisms mediating the inhibitory synaptic dysfunction in WD are incompletely understood. | Herein, we used a TX mouse model of WD to verify whether the PKR inhibitor C16 can regulate the PKReIF2α pathway, prevent copper-induced synaptic dysfunction, and serve as a neuroprotective agent to improve cognitive function in WD mice with cognitive impairment. | 2.2 Drug administration To inhibit PKR phosphorylation, we administered the PKR inhibitor PKR-IN-C16 (C16, Imidazolo-oxindole PKR inhibitor C16) (Selleck, USA) to WT or TX mice via intraperitoneal injections every morning for 30 days at a dose of 0.2 mLmouse (300 μgkg). | The levels of the aforementioned compounds in each sample were determined using a microplate reader at specific wavelengths as per the manufacturers protocol. | We collected the chromatograms of the compounds and integrated them using Xcalibur version 3.0 software, and a linear regression was generated with a weighting coefficient of 1X2. | The mammalian CNS relies heavily on γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as its primary inhibitory neurotransmitter, whereas glutamate serves as the main excitatory neurotransmitter. | The data we collected indicate that TX mice experienced a disruption in their excitatory and inhibitory signaling, resulting in an overabundance of possible excitotoxicity. | 3.5 C16 protection against behavior impairment and hippocampal neuronal damage attenuation in murine model of Wilsons disease (WD) We tested the effectiveness of C16, a strong inhibitor of PKR (in TX mice in vivo) to investigate whether pharmacologically blocking the activation of the PKReIF2α pathway could prevent synaptic dysfunction. | FIGURE 5 C16, a PKR inhibitor, provides protection against behavior impairment and reduces hippocampal neuronal damage in murine model of Wilsons disease (WD). | (A) Flow chart of PKR inhibitor C16 treatment. | (B) Western blot results showing total PKR and phosphorylated PKR in the hippocampus of mice and p-PKR: total PKR ratio (n 3); the toxic milk (TX) mice were either treated with the C16 PKR inhibitor or an equivalent mock treatment. | 3.6 Synaptic dysfunction prevention by PKR inhibitor C16 treatment in murine model of Wilsons disease (WD) Our next step was to determine whether the C16 treatment could reduce synaptic dysfunction. | FIGURE 6 C16, a PKR inhibitor, attenuates the synaptic dysfunction of Wilsons disease (WD) in murine model. | 3.7 PKReIF2α pathway activation inhibition by the PKR inhibitor C16 in murine model of Wilsons disease (WD) Although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, our data show that C16 was effective in alleviating the cognitive and synaptic dysfunction of TX mice. | Our results suggest that the inhibition of the activation of the PKReIF2α pathway by the PKR inhibitor C16 attenuated the synaptic dysfunction caused by copper deposition and provided cognitive protection to TX mice. | FIGURE 7 The PKR inhibitor C16 inhibits activation of the PKReIF2α pathway in a murine model of Wilsons disease (WD). | Moreover, TX mice exhibited disturbances in excitatory and inhibitory signaling, leading to an excess of excitotoxicity, which could further exacerbate oxidative stress and disrupt synaptic function. | By preventing the phosphorylation of PKR in WD, the PKR inhibitor C16 effectively inhibits the PKReIF2α pathway and attenuates synaptic dysfunction, safeguarding against neuronal damage, cognitive decline, and neurodegenerative disorders.",

Table 3; Supplementary Figures S9, S10) and 2D (HSQC, HMBC, COSY, ROESY, and H2BC; Figure 3B; Supplementary Figures S11S15) data of the 7a7b mixture confirmed their structural similarity to the previously reported compounds in the thiazostatin and watasemycin families (Supplementary Figure S8). | The lack of a methylation in the C-5 position makes the compounds more similar to the thiazostatins rather than the C-5 methylated watasemycins. | The compounds were consequently given the names thiazostatin D (7a) and thiazostatin E (7b) since Liu et al. | (2022) published a thiazostatin-like compound bearing one hydroxyl group at ring A in position 2 and O-methylation of the carboxylic acid on ring C. | 3.5 Bioactivity of the isolated compound The isolated compounds were a mixture of the two closely related thiazostatins D and E, and since a further separation of the two isomers was not possible, the two compounds were tested for potential bioactivities. | agalactiae since the latter one has shown the highest sensitivity when screening extracts, extract fractions, and compounds for anti-microbial activities in our experience (Kristoffersen et al., 2018;

since the immortalized lung-fibroblast cell line MRC5 was seemingly not affected by the compounds and the MCF7 (breast cancer) cell line has shown just 15 survival, we repeated the anti-proliferative assay using five cell lines (the three initially tested cell lines plus Molm13 and MDA-MB-468) and concentrations of 50 μgmL1 and 10 μgmL1, the limitation to five cell lines and two concentrations was due to the available compound quantity. | 3.6 Different σ-factor engineering approaches facilitate the production shift within the pathway and enable activation of the production of a novel compound To investigate the influence of Actinoplanes sp. | Gene deletion and expression strains were created for both genes, and the production of the different compounds was investigated since preliminary data indicated a putative regulatory influence of these genes on the production of further metabolites. | SigH expression resulted in an increased peak intensity of watasemycin (1) and putative watasemycin-related compound 6 of mz 369.0929 when compared to the wildtype (Figure 6). | The ΔsigH strain showed an opposite effect on the peak intensities of the 2-hydroxyphenylthiazoline family compounds. | Under gene deletion, watasemycin (1) peak intensity is significantly reduced in relation to the other watasemycin pathway-derived compounds and the peak intensity of aerugine (5) and pulicatin (4) is increased. | Different compounds are highlighted: 1) watasemycin mz 353.0988 , 2) thiazostatin mz 339.0836 , 3) isopyochelin mz 325.0656 , 4) pulicatin mz 324.0743 , 5) aerugine mz 210.0583 , 6) mz 369.0929 , 7) thiazostatin DE mz 355.0779 , 8) mz 355.0779 , and 9) mz 440.2768 . | Strikingly, we hereby observed the production of an unknown compound 10 of mz 462.1643 with calculated elemental composition C19H27NO12. | This highly polar compound was not detected in the Actinoplanes sp. | Different compounds are highlighted: 1) watasemycin mz 353.0988 , 2) thiazostatin mz 339.0836 , 3) isopyochelin mz 325.0656 , 4) pulicatin mz 324.0743 , 5) aerugine mz 210.0583 , 6) mz 369.0929 , 7) thiazostatin DE mz 355.0779 , 8) mz 355.0779 , 9) mz 440.2768 , and 10) mz 462.1643 . | The rendered product distribution of the identified compounds by sigma factor engineering is suspected to affect the strains siderophoric ability since aerugine and (iso)pyochelin have siderophore and iron-chelating ability (Inahashi et al., 2017) and thiazostatin and watasemycin are suspected of having siderophore activity according to the functional group-based prediction provided by SIDERITE (He et al., 2024). | 4 Discussion In this study, we describe the identification of five thiazostatin-related molecules and the discovery, identification, and characterization of similar compounds that were termed thiazostatin D and thiazostatin E. | We further describe the influence of sigma factor engineering on the production of these compounds that led to changes in peak intensities between them and the exclusive production of a novel unidentified compound. | Furthermore, since a mixture of two close structural isomers was tested, it is unknown whether both compounds have the same level on bioactivity as it was shown that watasemycin A has a stronger antibacterial activity than watasemycin B. | However, compound 6 was still produced, despite the assumption that both compounds are produced by the same pathway since the predicted elemental compositions of C16H20N2O4S2 (compound 6) and C15H18N2O4S2 (compound 7) are highly similar. | They differ in CH2 with a weight difference of 14 kDa, indicating the methylation of thiazostatin DE as the final molecular modification for the formation of compound 6. | However, the results of the sigH expression indicate that production of compound 6 may not rely on thiazostatin DE as the precursor and could be based on watasemycin. | While ACSP50_0284 prevented biosynthesis of compounds 17, a large peak of a new compound pf mz 462.1643 was detected. | The compound elutes early at 1.471.68 min and must be highly polar. | Its elemental composition was predicted as C19H27NO12, and no similar molecules could be determined during comprehensive literature and database research, indicating that compound 10 could be a novel molecule. | The ACSP50_0284 expression strain exclusively produces the compound, which is not detectable in any other Actinoplanes sp. | Despite encoding an anti-anti-σ factor, which is no direct transcriptional activator, it can confer the σ factor.",

      "text_block": "The 518 human kinases, known as the kinome, are frequently dysregulated in disease and highly druggable with ATP-competitive inhibitors. | Kinases are frequently dysregulated in human disease, and they are highly druggable with ATP-competitive, small molecule inhibitors.1013 Because of that, kinases have emerged as one of the most important classes of drug targets for combating cancers,14 autoimmune and inflammatory diseases,15, 16 neurological disorders,17 and infectious diseases.18, 19 Kinase activity, localization, and substrate recognition are regulated by dynamic PPI networks composed of scaffolding and adapter proteins, other signaling enzymes like small GTPases and E3 ligases, and their phospho-substrates.2022 Profiling kinase PPI networks can, therefore, help determine kinome activation states, and how kinases are connected to signaling pathways.23, 24 This information can be used, in turn, for determining the mechanisms of kinase-mediated cell signaling in health and disease, and for prioritizing kinases among the 518 members of the kinome in drug target discovery.23, 24 Large-scale maps of PPI networks have been generated using yeast and mammalian two-hybrid systems,25 and mass spectrometry (MS)-based approaches like affinity purification (AP)-MS,26, 27 size-exclusion chromatography-MS,28 protein crosslinking-MS,29 and proximity labeling-MS methods like BioID and APEX,3, 25, 3033 however, there is still a critical need for more sensitive and high-throughput methods that can systematically map kinome interaction networks and their dynamics.23 We developed the 2nd generation (gen) kinobead competition and correlation analysis (kiCCA) approach for the sensitive and high-throughput profiling of kinome PPIs. Like our 1st gen approach, 2nd gen kiCCA utilizes kinobeads, also known as multiplexed inhibitor beads (MIBs), for affinity purification of the kinome from native cell and tissue lysates, combined with a competitive binding assays using our library of broad-selectivity kinase inhibitors (KIs) that we named kinase interactome probes (KIPs).23, 3439 The competitive binding assay is followed by shotgun nano liquid chromatography (nLC)-MS analysis to determine competed kinases and non-kinase proteins. | We show (1) that kinobead AP-MS with diaPASEF increased the analytical depth of the assayable kinome, which we exploited to determine the kinome-wide selectivity of four clinical anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors, and (2) that 2nd gen kiCCA increased the number of observable kinome PPIs by 6.1-fold compared to our 1st gen approach, which we utilized to determine signaling pathways and therapeutic targets that promote neuroblastoma (NB) cell phenotypic plasticity. | NB cell phenotypic plasticity can promote therapy resistance and metastasis in high-risk NB, allowing cancer cells to transdifferentiate from a noradrenergic neuronal-like phenotype to a more mesenchymal-like phenotype.4246 For instance, the noradrenergic-mesenchymal transition (NMT) has been shown to increase NB resistance to ALK inhibitor and chemotherapy,47, 48 and to modulate the response to disialoganglioside GD2-targeted immunotherapy.49, 50 Accordingly, pharmacological strategies to reverse the NMT, and thereby reduce metastasis and therapy resistance, are urgently needed. | Furthermore, we show that inhibiting these pathways with selective kinase inhibitors can disrupt the opposing NMT phenotypes. | To clarify if the increased analytical depth of diaPASEF-powered kinobead AP-MS can identify unreported kinase inhibitor targets, we profiled the kinome selectivity of the 1st gen ALK inhibitor crizotinib, the 2nd gen ALK inhibitor ceritinib, and the 3rd gen ALK inhibitors entrectinib and lorlatinib.54 Several ALK inhibitors are approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) that carry ALK gene fusions.55 Furthermore, the ALK gene is affected by gain of function mutations in 14 of high-risk NB cases, and ALK inhibitors like lorlatinib are being tested in clinical trials against high-risk NB.56 A better understanding of ALK inhibitor target profiles in NB cells will help determine their mechanisms of action, optimize treatments, and avoid off-target toxicities. | TNK1 has recently been shown to promote tumor growth and autophagy, and MAP4K2 and MAP2K6 activate the JNK and p38 branches of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling that can confer therapy resistance to cancer cells.62, 63 Collectively, our results identified previously unreported off-targets of clinical ALK inhibitors, whose inhibition may contribute to their clinical efficacy in NSCLCs and NBs. 2. | These included kinases controlling neuronal growth, differentiation and survival like the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptors type 1 and 2 (NTRK1 and 2), cell polarity like the MAPmicrotubule affinity-regulating kinases 14 (MARK14), and cell migration like the myosin light chain kinase (MYLK, Fig. | To test our target hypotheses, we treated the SH-SY5Y (noradrenergic neuronal-like) and SK-N-SH (mesenchymal-like) cell lines with the selective CK2 inhibitor SGC-CK21 and the selective TBK1 inhibitor GSK8612 for four days.77, 78 To determine inhibitor effects on NMT pathways, we then performed global MS-based proteome analysis; this showed that CK2 inhibition significantly altered the expression of 3,202 proteins in the SH-SY5Y cell line (40 of the proteome) and the expression of 2,147 proteins in the SK-N-SH cell line (26 of the proteome), whereas TBK1 inhibition did not alter protein expression in the SH-SY5Y cell line, but significantly altered the expression of 708 proteins in the SK-N-SH cell line (8.5, Table S2, two sample students t-test, BH-FDR 0.05, N 4 and N 3). | In contrast TBK1 inhibition significantly decreased migration in SK-N-SH cell lines, as did dasatinib, a broad selectivity inhibitor of Src-family kinases which served as our positive control (Fig. | DISCUSSION Here, we demonstrated that diaPASEF-powered kinobead AP-MS and 2nd gen kiCCA are versatile and efficient MS-based chemoproteomic tools for kinome interaction profiling, which includes kinase-inhibitor and kinase-protein interactions. | Specifically, we showed that diaPASEF kinobead AP-MS identified previously unreported kinase targets of clinical ALK inhibitors that may explain their mechanism of action and clinical efficacy. | Thus, lorlatinib may inhibit kinases that are involved in JNK and p38 signaling, and in autophagy (TNK1), all processes that have been shown to promote therapy resistance in vivo.62, 63, 79 Lorlatinib is the ALK inhibitor that has progressed the furthest in clinical trials against high-risk NB to date,56 and has the most off-target kinases of all ALK inhibitors that we tested. | Collectively, this suggested that the polypharmacology of lorlatinib is critical for its clinical efficacy, and that more efficient inhibitors with engineered polypharmacology could be developed utilizing the insights that we obtained. | Drugs and concentrations used were the TBK1 inhibitor GSK8612 (2 μM final, Mechem Express, MCE), the CK2 inhibitor SGC-CK21 (2 μM final, MCE), and dasatinib (100 nM final, MCE). | Then, the TBK1 inhibitor GSK8612 (2 μM final, MCE), the CK2 inhibitor SGC-CK21 (2 μM final, MCE), or DMSO (vehicle control) were added. | Kinase affinity enrichment, KI competition, and on-bead digestion of proteins Kinase affinity enrichment, KI competition, and on-bead digestion of proteins was performed as previously described.23 In addition to the 21 KIPs, the following kinase inhibitors were used as the competitors for soluble competition experiments at the given final concentrations: lorlatinib (1 μM final, MCE), entrectinib (1 μM final, MCE), crizotinib (1 μM final, MCE), and ceritinib (1 μM final, MCE). | Alternatively, we applied a simple p 0.05 (validation mode in kinobead and Co-IPMS data).23 Plotting STRING interaction networks PPI network models were plotted using the STRING web application version 12.0 with the following settings: Edges were scaled with confidence, and only physical subnetwork interactions were considered, i.e., only considering text mining, experiments, and databases.82 Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) For gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we used the ssGSEA2.0 script in R together with the Gene Ontology: Biological Process (GOBP) gene set of the MSigDB database (c5.bp.v7.0.symbols) according to the published protocol with the following minor modifications:83 to rank gene names, we calculated a compound score using the two sample Students t-test log2 MS intensity difference multiplied by the log10 p-value.",

      "text_block": "Traditionally, these metabolites have been categorized into distinct, often opposing groups, such as pro-oxidant versus antioxidant, excitotoxicneurotoxic versus neuroprotective. | A molecule that acts as neuroprotective at low concentrations may exhibit neurotoxic effects at elevated levels. | The compounds are under investigation for their possible functions as risk factors for the initiation of diseases, as biomarkers for early detection, or as targets for tentative interventions to slow down the progression . | Notwithstanding these initial findings, the exact biological importance of these compounds, particularly their involvement in metabolic pathways, remained unknown for a considerable period of time. | Further investigation in the mid-20th century revealed that Trp could be enzymatically degraded via the KYN pathway, producing several biologically significant compounds such as KYNA and QUIN (Figure 1). | Specifically, KYNA is thought to have antioxidant and neuroprotective properties, whereas 3-HK and QUIN act as pro-oxidants and neurotoxins . | Furthermore, this divergence has led to the concept of neuroprotective and neurotoxic sub-pathways within KYN metabolism . | Understanding this intricate balance may provide crucial insights into developing therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating KYN pathways for neuroprotection. | Trp is essential for protein synthesis and serves as a precursor to bioactive compounds such as serotonin, melatonin, and NAD, which are crucial for sustaining physiological functions . | These compounds are essential for maintaining physiological processes. | Their dual functionssome neuroprotective, some neurotoxicmake the KYN pathway an important area of research for understanding and potentially treating these diseases. | KYNA has been identified for its neuroprotective effects through antioxidant mechanisms, and historical research has gradually uncovered its contributions to protecting the brain from oxidative damage . | The broad recognition of KYNA as an antioxidant compound likely solidified in the scientific literature around 20052010 as more studies began to explore its multifaceted neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory roles . | However, the pathway also has neuroprotective functions, helping to regulate excitatory neurotransmission and prevent harmful cellular stress (Table 1). | These multiple roles in excitotoxicity, neuroprotection, and immune regulation make the KYN metabolism a critical focus for research into therapies for neurodegenerative and immune-related disorders, as its balance between toxicity and protection can significantly impact disease progression. | The KYN pathway, responsible for the metabolism of Trp into several neuroactive compounds, plays a dual role in neuroprotection and neurotoxicity, with KYNA contributing to the preservation of neuronal health (Table 1). | In research in the early 1990s, researchers further emphasized the neuroprotective effects of KYNA. | The development of the concept that the KYN pathway divides into neurotoxic and neuroprotective branches arose from early studies on the duality between KYN metabolites: KYNA as neuroprotective, and 3-HK and QUIN as neurotoxic . | This understanding of the pathways dual nature has since driven research aimed at developing therapeutic strategies to shift the balance toward neuroprotection by modulating KYNA and QUIN levels. | This complexity underscores the need to reconsider traditional views on how these compounds influence neuroprotection, excitotoxicity, and immune regulation. | This co-antioxidant activity highlighted the compounds nuanced role in modulating oxidative stress, depending on cellular conditions and its interactions with other antioxidant molecules. | This versatility positions 3-HAA as an important factor in physiological processes such as immune regulation and neuroprotection . | KYNA has been widely studied for its neuroprotective antioxidant properties, but recent research indicates it can also act as a pro-oxidant under certain conditions. | These interactions highlight KYNs role in balancing excitatory neurotransmission and immune responses, contributing to its involvement in both neuroprotective and neuroinflammatory processes. | Additionally, KYNA has inhibitory effects on metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), particularly the mGlu2 and mGlu3 subtypes, which are involved in regulating synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release . | Through these interactions, KYNA plays a neuroprotective role by limiting overactive excitatory signaling. | Activation of AhR by KYNA links it to anti-inflammatory processes, contributing to its broader neuroprotective properties . | Through these interactions, XA can regulate glutamate-related excitatory signaling and contribute to neuroprotective effects. | This interaction can modulate neurotransmission and has potential implications for neuroprotective strategies. | It was discovered that exercise-induced upregulation of enzymes in skeletal muscle, such as kynurenine aminotransferases (KATs), converts neurotoxic KYN into KYNA, a neuroprotective metabolite, thereby reducing stress-induced depression . | IAAld, while not a strong direct agonist, plays an important role in the metabolic pathways that lead to the formation of potent AhR activators , emphasizing the selective and context-dependent modulation of AhR by Trp metabolites (Table 2). | It has demonstrated neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects, preventing lipid peroxidation, reducing DNA damage, and inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine synthesis . | Physical activity has been shown to regulate the production and metabolism of KYN, altering the balance between neurotoxic and neuroprotective metabolites . | For example, KYN and its metabolites can act as inhibitors, modulating the activity of key enzymes involved in immune responses. | Pathway analysis allows researchers to map complex signaling networks, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or Janus kinasesignal transducers and activators of transcription (JAKSTAT) pathways, which often involve multiple orders of molecular interactions . | KYN metabolites exhibit dual behavior: some, like KYNA, are neuroprotective and act as antioxidants, while others, such as 3-HK and QUIN, promote oxidative stress and neurotoxicity . | This complexity in KYN metabolism challenges prior binary categorizations and highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of how these metabolites influence neuroprotection, immune regulation, and oxidative stress. | Furthermore, KYNAs neuroprotective and cytoprotective properties make it a promising nutraceutical that may promote cognitive health by scavenging neurotoxic metabolites . | Ultimately, this evolving perspective not only reshapes our understanding of neuroprotection and neurotoxicity but also sets the stage for novel clinical applications targeting metabolic imbalances. | IDO1 inhibitors such as epacadostat have been tested in advanced stages as standalone treatments or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, but some studies, including Phase III trials, have struggled to meet primary endpoints . | BMS-986205 is another IDO1 inhibitor that has been tested in Phase IIIII trials for solid tumors, typically in combination with anti-PD-1 antibodies . | M4112, a dual IDO1TDO2 inhibitor, has shown promise in Phase I trials to improve immune responses by inhibiting Trp metabolism, which can impair T-cell function . | Furthermore, KNS366, a selective KMO inhibitor developed by Kynos Therapeutics, has completed Phase I trials aimed at controlling inflammation by lowering pro-inflammatory metabolites . | This complex pathway plays a significant role in modulating immune responses, neuroinflammation, and neuroprotection, making it a promising target for integrated therapeutic strategies. | The authors emphasize the necessity of moving beyond the binary categorization of KYN metabolites, such as pro-oxidantantioxidant or neuroprotectiveneurotoxic.",

      "title": "Novel insights into cuproptosis inducers and inhibitors",
      "text_block": "And strategies for developing cuproptosis inducers and inhibitors involved in these targets have been continuously improved. | Briefly, based on the essential cuproptosis targets and metabolic pathways, this paper classifies some relevant inducers and inhibitors including small molecule compounds, transcription factors and ncRNAs with the overview of principle, scientific and medical application, in order to provide reference for the cuproptosis study and target therapy in the future. | Meanwhile, inducers and inhibitors of cuproptosis have been widely applied in scientific and medical areas. | However, the targets and metabolic pathways of Cu-dependent cell death are not totally explained, which limits the development and application of cuproptosis inducers and inhibitors. | In this study, we intend to briefly summarize the essential targets and metabolic pathways of cuproptosis, then categorize commonly used and newly discovered inducers and inhibitors with the overview of principle, scientific and medical application, and discuss their future development tendency, hoping to increase the understanding of the inducers and inhibitors in research field and disease target therapy based on cuproptosis. | Over the past decade, multiple types of ferroptosis inducers and inhibitors have been employed in practice in terms of the targets and metabolic pathways involved in Fe-dependent cell death (Du and Guo, 2022). | Similarly, the strategies of cuproptosis inducers and inhibitors have been continuously improved based on the key targets in cuproptosis metabolic pathways (Figure 3): oxidative stress, mitochondrial respiration, ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). | Among them, FDX1 and lipoylated proteins including lipoic acid pathway lipoacyltransferase 1 (LIPT1), lipoyl synthase (LIAS), dihydroacylamide dehydrogenase (DLD) and lipoylated targets dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase (DLAT), pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 subunit α 1 (PDHA1), pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 subunit β (PDHB) act as positive regulatory factors, while glutaminase (GLS), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), metal regulatory transcription factor 1 (MTF1) generate negative regulatory effects (Tsvetkov et al., 2022). | Therefore UPS inhibition is responsible for the another metabolic pathway involved in Cu-dependent cell death, which can not be neglected for the design strategy of cuproptosis inducers and inhibitors. | In this section, based on the characteristic targets and metabolic pathways of cuproptosis, the cuproptosis inducers we collect are categorized into small molecule compounds, transcription factors and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) (Figure 4; Table 1). | FIGURE 4 The small molecule compounds, transcription factors and ncRNAs to induce Cu-dependent cell death. | We have collected some small molecule compounds targeting Cu ionophore ①, membrane transporter ②, reservation ③, chaperone ④, mitochondrial respiration and TCA cycle ⑤, transcription factors targeting membrane transporter ⑥ and ncRNAs ⑦ targeting FDX1 to induce Cu-dependent cell death. | Small molecule compounds Elesclomol Cu ionophore FDX1 Cardiopathy, Menkes, cancer Guthrie et al. | 3.1 Small molecule compounds to raise intracellular Cu content by targeting Cu ionophores, membrane transporters, reservation and chaperones 3.1.1 Cu ionophores As lipophilic compounds, Cu ionophores are reversible copper complexes that deliver Cu(II) into cells. | In the study of Tsvetkov et al., researchers tested 1,448 compounds and screened against 489 cell lines from PRISM Repurposing Secondary dataset to verify drugs with growth inhibition similar to elesclomol (Tsvetkov et al., 2022). | Disulfiram: DSF is a dithiocarbamate compound that treats alcohol dependence by targeting aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), while acid condition reduces DSF to diethyldithiocarbamate (DTC) and invests the capacity to combine Cu(II) (Viola-Rhenals et al., 2018); DTC-Cu(II) complex induces lethal effects in ALDH and nuclear protein localization 4 positive (NPL4) cancer cells combined with Cu overload (Skrott et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2016). | In addition to clioquinol-Cu, many Cu complexes have been exploited as proteasome inhibitors, e.g., 8-quinolinol-Cu (Zhai et al., 2010), schiff base-Cu (Kumar et al., 2024), pyrithione-Cu (Chen et al., 2017) and so on. | Other Cu ionophores including P53 mutant reactivator zinc metallochaperone (Zaman et al., 2019), bis-thiosemicarbazone Cu(II) complexes Cu(II)ATSMCu(II)GTSM (Soon et al., 2011; Andres et al., 2020; Crouch et al., 2009) and C7-locked N-(quinoline-8-yl)benzenesulfonamide analogue UM4118 (Moison et al., 2024) are also undergoing preclinical studies of tumoral and neurodegenerative diseases. | 3.1.2 Cu membrane transporters SLC31A1 and ATP7A7B are classic membrane transporters that mediate Cu(I) endocytosis and expulsion, thus using small molecule compounds to regulate SLC31A1 and ATP7A7B may be a valid strategy to control intracellular Cu content and cuproptosis. | Epigallocatechol gallate, a green tea polyphenol (Chen et al., 2020), β-elemene, a curcuma wenyujin plant extract (Li et al., 2016), they can upregulate SLC31A1 expression; CID 2011756, a protein kinase D inhibitor (Janardhanan et al., 2022), omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (Matsui et al., 2015), 6-hydroxydopamine hydrobromide, a neurotoxin (Kondo et al., 2021), they can downregulate ATP7A7B expression. | These compounds are employed for cancer and Parkinson therapy. | Actinomycin D, a DNA repair inhibitor, can decrease metallothionein expression (Steinebach and Wolterbeek, 1994); PAPA NONOate, a NO donor, can oxidize metallothionein-sulfur (Liu et al., 2000); DL-Buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine serves as an inhibitor of GSH synthesis (Steinebach and Wolterbeek, 1994). | These compounds can be employed to disrupt the Cu reservation mediated by GSH-metallothionein so that dysfunction Cu homeostasis. | 3.1.4 Cu chaperones ATOX1, CCS, COX17 carry intracellular Cu(I) to nucleus, Golgi apparatus, SOD, mitochondria, respectively and modulate normal metabolic activities, thereby inhibition of Cu chaperones will reduce Cu trafficking, another approach to aggravate Cu accumulation via small molecule compounds (Chen et al., 2022). | reported a small molecule DC_AC50, inhibitor of ATOX1 and CCS, disrupted intracellular Cu transport and triggered oxidative stress in cancer cells (Wang et al., 2015). | Thus DC_AC50 is also a potential cuproptosis inducer to mediate Cu-dependent cell death, but the specific COX17 inhibitor awaits further exploration. | 3.2 Small molecule compounds to induce cuproptosis by targeting mitochondrial respiration and TCA cycle Tsvetkov P et al. | The small molecule compounds that suppress glycolysis and favor OXPHOS may thus be promising tools for killing cells sensitive to cuproptosis. | Phloretin (glucose transporter (GLUT) inhibitor) (Zhang et al., 2024), PX-478 (hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) inhibitor) (Li et al., 2024), 2-deoxy-D-glucose (hexokinase inhibitor) (Yang et al., 2023), galactose (Tsvetkov et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2023), these glycolysis inhibitors would have been taken into therapeutic consideration for cancer sensitive to cuproptosis through driving reprogramming of TCA cycle and OXPHOS. | 4 Cuproptosis inhibitors The eligible cuproptosis inhibitors should antagonize the cell death effects of Cu overload and alleviate the cellular damages induced by cuproptosis including oxidative stress, mitochondrial respiration dysfunction and UPS inhibition. | Tsvetkov and colleagues verified that the cytotoxicity of Cu ionophore was eliminated by Cu chelator (tetrathiomolybdate) rather than other pathway inhibitors including Z-VAD-FMK, Boc-D-FMK (apoptosis), ferrostatin-1 (ferroptosis) and necrostatin-1 (necroptosis), whereas other metal chelators such as deferoxamine mesylate and TPEN had no effect on the killing capacity induced by Cu ionophore (Tsvetkov et al., 2022). | Mechanically, the Cu cell death effects depended on mitochondrial respiration and TCA cycle, since treatment with mitochondrial antioxidants, fatty acids, mitochondrial function inhibitors induced distinct effects on Cu ionophore sensitivity; and furthermore treatment with electron transport chain complexes (ETC) inhibitors, mitochondrial pyruvate uptake inhibitors attenuated the cell death; treatment with mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP had no effect on Cu cytotoxicity (Tsvetkov et al., 2022). | The scientific and medical communities have continuously developed available drugs for the diseases in Cu overload, and the discovery of cuproptosis significantly accelerates the progress of cuproptosis inhibitors. | Based on the targets and metabolic pathways involved, like inducers, the cuproptosis inhibitors we collect can be similarly categorized into small molecule compounds, transcription factors and ncRNAs (Figure 5; Table 2). | FIGURE 5 The small molecule compounds, transcription factors and ncRNAs to suppress Cu-dependent cell death. | We have collected some small molecule compounds targeting Cu chelator ①, reservation ②, mitochondrial respiration and TCA cycle ③, oxidative stress ④, transcription factors targeting energy metabolism, membrane transporter, reservation ⑤ and ncRNA ⑥ targeting FDX1 to suppress Cu-dependent cell death. | TABLE 2 Display of cuproptosis inhibitors. | Small molecule compounds GSH Cu chelator Cu ions Oxidative stress Tsvetkov et al. | 4.1 Small molecule compounds to reduce intracellular Cu content by targeting Cu chelators and reservation 4.1.1 Cu chelators In contrast to ionophores delivering Cu ions to cells, Cu chelators are another type of Cu complexes that reduce intracellular Cu content and perturbate cuproptosis pathways. | et al., 2023); the synthesized 2,6-Pyridinedicarboxylic acid, 2,6-bis hydrazide and 3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylaldehyde rhodamine hydrazone bore the capacity to counter Cu ions to rescue the deposits of amyloid-beta peptide in Alzheimers disease model of Drosophila (Singh et al., 2013; Chauhan et al., 2022); captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor for hypertension, is reported to protect against free radical by chelation to Cu (Tamba and Torreggiani, 2000); other Cu chelators include LCC-12, a derivative of metformin with anti-inflammatory effects and curcumin, a naturally occurring polyphenol with anti-tumor activity (Solier et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2018). | Zinc acetate is one such notable small molecule compound developed for the treatment of Wilson disease, which induces the expression of metallothionein in intestinal cells to block Cu absorption and reduce Cu deposition in brain and liver, albeit initial gastric irritation in fewer patients (Munk et al., 2022). | However, there are rare small molecule compounds in response to facilitating GSH synthesis and metallothionein induction in the field of Cu reservation and cuproptosis to date, such compounds are awaiting further exploration. | 4.2 Small molecule compounds to inhibit cuproptosis by targeting mitochondrial respiration and TCA cycle According to the outcome of Tsvetkov et al., the cells with active mitochondrial respiration and high levels of lipoylated TCA enzymes were more sensitive to the Cu-dependent cell death; treatment with fatty acids, mitochondrial function inhibitors and mitochondrial antioxidants showed different degrees of influence on Cu cytotoxicity; notably ETC inhibitors and mitochondrial pyruvate uptake inhibitors retarded the cell death effects by Cu-ionophores (Tsvetkov et al., 2022). | Thereby the small molecule compounds that impair ETC and mitochondrial pyruvate uptake enable to inhibit cuproptosis by targeting mitochondrial respiration and TCA cycle. | The insecticide rotenone is an ETC I inhibitor that drives cell apoptosis via the induction of ROS in mitochondria (Kishore Kumar et al., 2017). | demonstrated that the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier inhibitor UK5099 elevated glycolytic enzymes and promoted glycolysis and lactate production (Wang et al., 2018). | Hence these ETC and mitochondrial pyruvate uptake inhibitors have the potential to reprogram the mitochondrial respiration and TCA cycle to glycolysis, which will induce the dynamic changes of cuproptosis-related genes and reduce the sensitivity to Cu stress. | 4.3 Small molecule compounds to alleviate cuproptosis by targeting oxidative stress In the study of Tsvetkov et al., although treatment with the oxidative stress inhibitor N-acetyl cysteine failed to abrogate the cell death mediated by elesclomol-Cu(II), excess ROS is one of the cell death effects generated by Cu Fenton reaction (Tsvetkov et al., 2022). | In addition to chelators reducing intracellular Cu content, we are looking for some small molecule compounds to alleviate the cellular damages of cuproptosis by reducing the ROS derived from Cu Fenton reaction. | These compounds can be considered for the potential treatment to alleviate Cu overload and toxicity by targeting oxidative stress. | So delivery of miRNA inhibitors reversing the ncRNA target effects on cuproptosis positive regulator devises novel therapeutic approach to carcinoma through the induction of cuproptosis, but it remains a big challenge. | Nowadays, the cuproptosis inducers and inhibitors have been continuously improved and employed for scientific studies and medical options, and in this study they are collected and categorized into small molecule compounds, transcription factors and ncRNAs, in terms of the key targets in cuproptosis metabolic pathways. | We pay more attention to small molecule compounds which influence the progress of Cu-induced cell death, rather than transcription factors, ncRNAs or other types of regulators, since they are more readily screened and dosed to produce therapeutic outcome than other types of candidates. | For inducers of cuproptosis, to raise intracellular Cu content, we collect some small molecule compounds targeting Cu ionophores: elesclomol, disulfiram, clioquinol, 8-quinolinol, schiff base, pyrithione, zinc metallochaperone, Cu(II)ATSMCu(II)GTSM, UM4118, they are capable of delivering Cu ions into cells; Cu membrane transporters: epigallocatechol gallate, β-elemene, CID 2011756, omeprazole, 6-hydroxydopamine hydrobromide, they can upregulate SLC31A1 expression or downregulate ATP7A7B expression to drive Cu deposition; Cu reservation: 6-hydroxydopamine hydrobromide, actinomycin D, PAPA NONOate, DL-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine, they enable to aggravate the release of intracellular Cu ions; Cu chaperones: DC_AC50, it has the ability to reduce Cu trafficking by inhibiting ATOX1 and CCS. | To enhance mitochondrial respiration and TCA cycle, the small molecule compounds phloretin, PX-478, 2-deoxy-D-glucose and galactose can be employed as glycolysis inhibitors to shift the energy metabolism to TCA cycle and OXPHOS. | The transcription factors ELF3, Sp1, ATF3SPI1, facilitating the expression of SLC31A1 and the ncRNAs LINC02362miR-18a-5p, facilitating the expression of FDX1 are accompanied to enhance the sensitivity to Cu stress beyond small molecule compounds (Figure 4; Table 1). | For inhibitors of cuproptosis, to reduce intracellular Cu content, we collect some small molecule compounds targeting Cu chelators: GSH, tetrathiomolybdate, bathocuproinedisulfonic acid, trientine, penicillamine, 2,6-Pyridinedicarboxylic acid, 2,6-bis hydrazide, 3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylaldehyde rhodamine hydrazone, captopril, LCC-12, curcumin, they are capable of chelating intracellular Cu ions; Cu reservation: Zinc acetate, it can elevate metallothionein level in intestinal cells. | To retard mitochondrial respiration and TCA cycle, the small molecule compounds rotenone, antimycin A, UK5099 can be employed as mitochondrial respiration inhibitors to shift the energy metabolism to glycolysis. | To recover oxidative homeostasis, the small molecule compounds coumarin, deferiprone, phenolic acids are helpful to eliminate the ROS derived from Cu Fenton reaction. | The transcription factors HIF-1α, facilitating hypoxia, MTF1, facilitating ATP7B and metallothionein expression and the ncRNA miR-21-5p, decreasing FDX1 expression are accompanied to reduce the sensitivity to Cu stress beyond small molecule compounds (Figure 5; Table 2). | The strategies to collect cuproptosis inducers originate from raising the intracellular Cu content and the intensity of mitochondrial respiration and TCA cycle, while the strategies to collect cuproptosis inhibitors originate from reducing intracellular Cu content, the intensity of mitochondrial respiration, TCA cycle, oxidative stress and UPS inhibition. | Importantly, the medical values of cuproptosis inducers and inhibitors are mainly concentrated in the treatment of genetic, neurodegenerative, cardiovascular and tumoral diseases, achieving by recovering normal Cu homeostasis, inducing Cu overload or deficiency. | But to date, we have not collected applicable small molecule compounds for the cuproptosis inhibitors that target Cu membrane transporters, Cu chaperones or UPS inhibition during Cu stress and they require further exploration. | It can be concluded from the studies that cuproptosis inducers and inhibitors have the potential to modulate Cu cell death effects relying on their composition and property, but the action mode may vary from distinct drug candidates and cell types. | Some compounds we collect have been applied for the clinical trials of Wilson disease such as tetrathiomolybdate (NCT00004339) (Brewer et al., 2006), trientine (NCT01472874) (Ala et al., 2015), penicillamine (Schilsky et al., 2022), Zinc acetate (NCT00212355) (Shimizu et al., 2010) and reduced Cu accumulation in liver and brain through complex and metallothionein chelation, respectively. | Hence, cuproptosis has attracted dramatic interests in providing a new avenue for medical options, and promising compounds that can modulate Cu-induced cell death in preclinical studies have been also collected and displayed in our study. | We should dedicate to improve the combination strategies so that the cuproptosis inducers and inhibitors we collect can provide better therapeutic approaches. | Therefore, nanocarriers selectively delivering cuproptosis inducers and inhibitors to the lesions can elevate precise therapeutic outcome and reduce toxicity for medical applications based on Cu cell death effects, but the composition, property, cell type of these delivery system, and further clinical trials still necessitate in-depth exploration. | In addition to the small molecule compounds, transcription factors and ncRNAs we collect in this study, we note that other types of cuproptosis-related molecules can also modulate Cu cell death effects. | Chiefly, small molecule compounds are strong candidates in regulating Cu-induced cell death owing to the suitable screen and administration routes. | The candidate compounds can be excavated from rounds of verification: bioinformatic analysis, molecular simulation and docking, interaction analysis. | In this study, we have collected kinds of cuproptosis inducers and inhibitors based on the key targets and metabolic pathways of Cu-induced cell death, but the combination strategy and drug carrier remain incompletely documented, which may thus be promising tools for curing patients with Cu homeostasis dysfunction. | Herein, we will keep our eye on Cu- and other metal elements-mediated cell death, particularly in the field of inducers and inhibitors, which are valuable for identifying cell death pathways, exploring disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets based on metal element dysfunction. | We mainly collect the small molecule compounds that induce or inhibit cuproptosis based on the key targets and metabolic pathways of Cu stress in this study, accompanied by relevant transcription factors and ncRNAs. They have the promising potential to be employed as inducers or inhibitors in the scientific studies and medical options of Cu homeostasis dysfunction. | Meanwhile the drug species, combination and delivery strategies of cuproptosis inducers or inhibitors also await further exploration.",

On the other hand, biologicsincluding truncated HGF, the N-terminal SEMA domain of HGF, the soluble extracellular domain of c-MET (decoy MET), and antibodies targeting HGF and c-METsuppress the pathway by preventing the interaction between HGF and c-MET. | Biologics typically offer more specific inhibition of the HGFc-MET signaling pathway than small molecules. | Studies conducted using the H596 NSCLC xenograft model have indicated that combining ficlatuzumab with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors such as erlotinib or cetuximab enhances its anti-cancer effects compared to using either agent alone. | When combined with gefitinib, a small-molecule EGFR inhibitor, TAK-701 effectively suppresses the phosphorylation of both c-MET and EGFR, along with their downstream signaling pathways, in HCC827-HGF tumor cells. | These results suggest that the combined use of TAK-701 and gefitinib might offer a solution to combat resistance to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors in HGF-induced NSCLC (72). | Activated HGFc-MET signaling is linked to poor prognosis and resistance to EGFR inhibitors in NSCLC (74). | On the other hand, the phase II study GO27819 aimed to assess the efficacy of the monovalent MET inhibitor onartuzumab in combination with bevacizumab (OnaBev) versus placebo plus bevacizumab (PlaBev) for recurrent glioblastoma, considering the reported aberrant expression of c-MET in glioblastoma. | Ficlatuzumab demonstrated efficacy when paired with EGFR inhibitors across various advanced solid tumors, including NSCLC. | NSCLC develops resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors with mutations in EGFR through diverse mechanisms, including activating the c-MET receptor pathway. | Upon binding to a membrane antigen, the payload, typically a toxic agent, is facilitated for internalization into cancer cell cytoplasm in response to the lysosomes low pH by ADCs. The payload is a small molecule chemotherapy drug; it can easily cross the membrane through simple diffusion and be released into the neighboring tumor cells upon dissociation from the ADC under lysosomal conditions. | It has been demonstrated to have antitumor activity in cancer cells overexpressing c-MET or with amplified MET, as well as in xenografts, including patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and those resistant to other c-MET inhibitors. | The growth of xenograft tumors resistant to other c-MET inhibitors is effectively inhibited by ABBV-399, which also offers significant therapeutic benefits when combined with standard chemotherapy (101). | In summary, ABBV-399 (telisotuzumab vedotin, Teliso-V) represents a promising advancement in targeting c-MET-overexpressing tumor cells, demonstrating significant antitumor activity across various preclinical models, including those resistant to other c-MET inhibitors. | The Phase I clinical trials have yielded encouraging results, with manageable adverse effects and notable antitumor efficacy, which has propelled the compound into Phase III trials. | 4.3.2 SHR-A1403 (HTI-1066) SHR-A1403, a Phase 1 clinical-stage c-MET-ADC, is a novel formulation comprising a humanized anti-c-MET antibody (of IgG2 subtype) connected via a non-cleavable linker to an enhanced version of a cytotoxic microtubule inhibitor SHR152852. | Further, a novel strategy was proposed to combat resistance to the EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), AZD9291, in NSCLC cells using SHR-A1403 (106). | SHR-A1403 was internalized into resistant cells and released the associated microtubule inhibitor, leading to cell-killing activity dependent solely on c-MET expression levels, irrespective of c-MET or EGFR signaling involvement in AZD9291 resistance. | High antitumor activity was demonstrated by TR1801-ADC in both high and medium-to-low c-MET-expressing cell lines, independent of MET gene copy number, outperforming a c-MET-ADC with a tubulin inhibitor payload. | 4.3.8 P3D12-vc-MMAF Responses to c-MET inhibitors have been seen in clinical trials; however, their effectiveness seems restricted to cases involving MET gene amplifications or mutations. | These data suggest that P3D12-vc-MMAF may offer a superior clinical profile for treating c-MET malignancies compared to c-MET pathway inhibitors (115). | PD-1CD28 chimeric switch receptors (CSR) have emerged, featuring PD-1 extracellular and CD28 intracellular domains, effectively transforming inhibitory PD-1 signals into stimulatory CD28 signals. | To counteract the inhibitory effect of PD-L1 on CAR-T cells, c-MET-specific CAR-T cells expressing PD-1-CSR amplify the stimulatory signals in T cells. | In the case of hEx16-Dbs, domain order may influence the agonistic activity of the anti-CD16 segment, a notion supported by cytokine production tests, which likely explains the enhanced efficacy of one particular hEx16-Db. The HL-type domain arrangement exhibited greater growth inhibitory effects than the LH-type (129). | The potential of c-MET as a therapeutic target takes center stage, offering the tantalizing prospect of dual inhibition against tumorigenesis and immunosuppression with a single c-MET inhibitor. | Additionally, clinical trials combining c-MET inhibitors with immunotherapies have yielded variable outcomes dependent on factors such as cancer subtype and patient demographics.",

      "title": "Evaluation of hydrazone and N-acylhydrazone derivatives of vitamin B6 and pyridine-4-carbaldehyde as potential drugs against Alzheimer’s disease",
      "text_block": "Our results showed that all of the tested hydrazones were potent inhibitors of human cholinesterases with inhibition constants (Ki) in micromolar range able to lower the activity of β-secretase, inhibit amyloid aggregation, chelate biometals and act as antioxidants. | Three out of six FDA-approved and currently used anti-Alzheimer drugs are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors that alleviate symptoms of AD by increasing acetylcholine concentrations in synapses thus enhancing neurotransmission and improving memory deficits5. | It has been reported that compounds containing a hydrazone functional (NNH2) group show antimicrobial, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and antitumoral activity16, as well as antioxidant, anticholinesterase, anti-monoamine oxidase, anti-BACE1 activity and inhibitory activity against fibril formation1620. | Moreover, some hydrazone derivatives have shown the potential to act as metal-protein attenuating compounds able to prevent protein aggregation, restore biometal homeostasis and decrease oxidative stress21,22. | Vitamin B6 represents a group of six compounds (pyridoxine, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine and their phosphorylated forms), all with an important biological role in living organisms acting as a coenzyme in numerous enzyme reactions24. | Hydrazone derivatives of vitamin B6 have been investigated as potential angiogenesis inhibitors26 and anti-tuberculosis drugs27, while the pyridyl-hydrazone derivative of vitamin B6 has been described as a potential antimalarial and antitumor agent25. | N-acylhydrazone moiety has been identified as a very promising motif in drug design and medicinal chemistry due to its presence in compounds acting on many different targets displaying antibacterial, antimycobacterial, antiviral, antitumor, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties28,29. | It is desirable that new compounds be synthesized in a safe and energy-efficient way using chemicals whose use assumes a compromise between the economic, social and ecological requirements of the production itself. | In this study, we synthesised eight hydrazone derivatives of pyridoxal and pyridine-4-carbaldehyde and eight N-acylhydrazone derivatives of pyridoxal and evaluated their biological potential against multiple AD hallmarks: inhibitory potential against acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), BACE1 and amyloid self-aggregation, as well as their chelating ability against biometals (Zn(II), Fe(II), Cu (II)), and their antioxidant activity. | These groups of compounds were chosen based on the structural similarity of their hydrazone moiety with amidine moiety in BACE1 inhibitors Verbecestat and Atabecestat, compounds which reached phase II clinical trials on AD patients or phase IIbIII clinical trials, respectively, whose high inhibition potency for BACE1 can be ascribed to formation of multiple hydrogen bonds between its amidine moiety and catalytic aspartates of the BACE1 active site3639. | Finally, to evaluate the potential of the tested compounds as drugs, the hydrazone derivatives displaying the most potent inhibitory activities were tested for their metabolic stability in human liver microsomes and in silico predictions of their human intestinal absorption were estimated. | The assignment of the 1H and 13C signals in the NMR spectra of the compounds was confirmed by cross peaks in the 2D spectra: 1H1H COSY (Correlation Spectroscopy),1H13C HMQC (Heteronuclear Multiple Quantum Coherence) and 1H13C HMBC (Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Correlation). | A TFA-d solution was used as an external reference for the 19F spectrum in compound 9 (19F: δ 11.50 ppm). | Stock solutions of compounds were prepared in DMSO and all further dilutions were done in water. | Synthesis General procedures To synthesise the target hydrazones (compounds 18), a solution of either pyridoxal hydrochloride or pyridine-4-carbaldehyde (0.74 mmol) was combined with the corresponding phenylhydrazine (1.1 equivalents, 0.81 mmol) in a selected solvent, either ethanol or acetone, following Scheme 1A. | Pyridoxal hydrochloride reacted with either benzohydrazide (yielding compounds 914), nicotine (yielding compound 15), or isonicotinohydrazide (yielding compound 16), as illustrated in Scheme 1B. | Briefly, AChE and BChE activities were measured at five different ATCh concentrations (up to 0.50 mM in the absence (v0) and presence (vi) of different hydrazone concentrations (i; final concentrations of 5 300 µM, depending on the compound) needed to obtain 2080 inhibition of enzyme activity. | At least three concentrations of inhibitors for each substrate concentration were used in at least three experiments. | To calculate the enzyme-inhibitor dissociation constants (Ki), the HunterDowns equation and the linear regression analysis41 were used: (1)Ki,appviiv0viKiKiKSs where Ki,app stands for the apparent inhibition constant, and KS for enzymesubstrate dissociation constant. | As relatively low substrate concentrations (up to 0.5 mM) were used in the experiments, the equation was used with the assumption that only the substrate binds to the catalytic anionic site (CAS), while the inhibitor can bind to both the CAS and peripheral anionic site (PAS). | In the graphical presentation of the HunterDawns equation, the linear dependence of Ki,app on the concentration of the substrate shows the competition of the inhibitor with the substrate for binding to the CAS of the enzyme (competitive type; c). | In the case of non-competitive binding (n), when the inhibitor binds only to the PAS of the enzyme, Ki,app does not depend on the concentration of the substrate. | The curve on the HunterDowns plot shows mixed inhibition (m) indicating that the inhibitor binds simultaneously to the CAS and PAS. | The final content of DMSO in measurements was up to 3, and for inhibitory reactions containing more than 0.1 of DMSO and corrected for control reactions containing a corresponding concentration of DMSO. | No side interactions of the tested compounds with ATCh or DTNB were detected. | The ability of compounds to inhibit BACE1 activity was determined as a percentage from the ratio of fluorescence signals obtained from inhibition reaction (FAB, BACE1, substrate and tested hydrazones with final concentrations of 10 µM and 50 µM, respectively) and control reaction (FAB, BACE1 and substrate only). | In the presence of compounds that have the ability to interfere with Aβ42 self-aggregation, a decrease in ThT fluorescence occurs46. | A solution of Aβ42 peptides (final concentration 8 µM) was incubated in the presence (inhibition reaction) and absence (control reaction) of the tested compounds (concentration ratio of Aβ42 peptides and tested compounds in inhibition reaction was 1:1) for 24 h at 37 C47,48. | To determine the potential effect of solvents and compounds on ThT fluorescence, ThT fluorescence was also measured alone with 1 PBS NH4OH DMSO (blank 1) and in the presence of tested compounds and 1 PBS NH4OH only (blank 2). | All control reactions contained DMSO in concentrations corresponding to the final concentration of the tested compounds. | Along with hydrazones, the inhibitory potential of curcumin was also measured as a positive control49. | The selected PDB structures are optimal since a flexible docking procedure was used where residues freely rotate and numerous different enzyme conformations are generated prior to the docking of compounds. | According to that classification, compounds with an LBF lower than 30 are classified as compounds with high, 3070 as moderate and those 70 as compounds with low metabolic stability60. | In silico evaluation of cytochrome P-450 sub-types inhibition To additionally elucidate the ability of compounds to affect the drug metabolism through their interaction with cytochrome P450 enzyme superfamily, prediction of compounds ability to inhibit CYP450 family was estimated in silico using online platform pkCSM. | Models for different P450 isoforms (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) were built using data from 18000 compounds whose ability to inhibit CYP P450 has been experimentally determined61. | Results and discussion Synthesis In this paper, four hydrazone derivatives of pyridoxal (14) and four hydrazone derivatives (58) of pyridine-4-carbaldehyde were prepared (Table 1) by conventional synthesis and MW synthesis in order to determine whether the compounds can be prepared over a shorter time and with higher yields. | The yields obtained ranged 1198, depending on the compounds and the method used. | Yields () obtained for the prepared compounds (116) in conventional and microwave-assisted synthesis (MW). | It was observed that the yields in MW synthesis were lower for all compounds when acetone was used compared to ethanol, which is in accordance with the fact that acetone is a medium microwave absorbing solvent compared to the highly absorbing ethanol. | The cross signals obtained by the HMBC NMR technique confirmed the desired structure of the compounds in the DMSO-d6 solution. | Inhibition of cholinesterases Fifteen compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit the action of AChE and BChE. | The tested compounds were divided into three groups: the first group consisting of four derivatives of pyridoxal and the second of three pyridine-4-carbaldehyde derivatives, while the third group consisted of eight N-acylhydrazone derivatives of pyridoxal. | Generally, all of the tested compounds reversibly inhibited both cholinesterases, AChE and BChE, in micromolar range with inhibition constants (Ki) ranging from 10 to 301 µM (Table 2). | As for AChE, the hydrazones derived from pyridoxal-inhibited AChE, with inhibition constants (Ki) ranging from 16 to 77 µM, were generally more potent inhibitors compared to the hydrazones derived from pyridine-4-carbaldehyde and all of the tested N-acylhydrazones which inhibited AChE with a Ki ranging from 155 to 301 µM, and 89 to 199 µM, respectively. | The most potent inhibitor was 2, a hydrazone derivative of pyridoxal and 2,4-dinitrophenylamine, with Ki 16 µM, which was about 5 times more potent compared to 1. | Compared to Donepezil and Galantamine, drugs used today for the treatment of AD, compound 2 was 670 and 31 times, respectively, a less potent inhibitor of AChE. | The difference in inhibition potency between compound 1 and 2 is a result of the different accommodation of the said compounds in the AChE active site which we assessed using molecular docking (Figure 1). | A list of all of the interactions between the tested compounds 116 and AChE is displayed in Tables S4S19. | Among the hydrazones derived from pyridine-4-carbaldehyde, the most potent AChE inhibitor was 8, with 4-fluorophenylamine. | Although each of the two groups were represented by a small number of compounds, a certain trend in inhibition potency could be observed. | From that group of compounds, the most potent inhibitor was 12, a 4-chlorohydrazone derivative of pyridoxal, which was twice more potent than its parent 9. | To evaluate the ability of compounds to prevent the formation of the stable AChE-Aß complex through interactions with amino acids from the AChE PAS and form toxic Aß peptide aggregates, compounds which displayed non-competitive or mixed inhibition were singled out (Table 2). | Most of the tested compounds inhibited AChE, displaying non-competitive and mixed inhibition without clear connections with their structure. | A non-competitive inhibition was displayed by 2, 7 and 8, while compounds 1, 35, 10 and 12 exhibited mixed inhibition. | In line with that, docking results supported our kinetic results in terms of accommodation of the compounds into the AChE active site gorge and formation of favourable interactions with amino acids from CAS and PAS. | However, the purpose of the molecular modelling tools used in this work was to provide an explanation for the observed kinetic differences among the tested compounds by illustrating binding modes and predicting nonbinding interactions of the compounds of interest, for which flexible molecular docking was used. | Inhibition of BChE was determined for 14 compounds with inhibition constants ranging from 10 to 254 µM, among which compound 1 was the most potent inhibitor of BChE. | Nevertheless, the results showed that the most potent inhibitors from each group were compounds without a substitution on the phenylhydrazone part of the molecule (1 and 5), while compounds with fluorine on the phenylhydrazone part of the molecule (3 and 7) were the least potent, suggesting that the addition of electron withdrawing groups can cause a decrease in inhibition potency towards BChE. | Moreover, it seems that the inhibition of BChE by N-acylhydrazones was affected by the electronegativity of the substituent on the benzohydrazide part of the molecule, as the most potent inhibitor was the compound with an electron donating methyl group (13), while the addition of a strongly electron withdrawingNO2 group (10) did not affect the inhibition potency compared to the unsubstituted 9. | A list of all of the interactions between tested compounds 116 and BChE is displayed in Tables S20S35. | According to recent studies on the pathophysiology of AD and development of drugs, compounds that are non-selective or even selective to BChE could be more effective in the treatment of middle and final stages of disease, in line with studies which showed that, with the progression of the disease, BChE activity increases, while that of AChE decreases67. | The rest of the compounds were up to three times more selective to one of the cholinesterases. | Interestingly, compounds with fluorine (3 and 7) showed only a slight preference towards AChE. | Inhibition of BACE1 As inhibition of BACE1 represents a possible strategy for treatment of Alzheimers disease, we tested the ability of compounds to inhibit its action. | As a measure of inhibition potency, the percentage of inhibition of BACE1 by 10 and 50 µM of compounds was used (Figure 4). | Concentrations were selected based on results of cholinesterase inhibition and corresponded to the determined Ki constants, also keeping in mind the solubility of the compounds. | Our results showed that all of the tested compounds inhibited activity of BACE1 at both concentrations by 1069. | Only compounds 15 and 16 inhibited BACE1 less than 10 at 10 µM. | Although some of these percentages are high, from the viewpoint of developing drugs for the central nervous system, what interests us the most are compounds that inhibit BACE1 activity by less than 50. | Percentages of inhibition by 10 µM compounds meet that criterion, as do most of the compounds at 50 µM. | Inhibition of amyloid self-aggregation All hydrazones, except for compound 6, were tested to evaluate their potential to inhibit self-aggregation of Aβ42 peptides. | All 15 compounds inhibited aggregation of Aβ42 peptides by 1137 (Figure 5). | The most potent inhibitors were N-acylhydrazones 10, 12 and 14, which inhibited amyloid aggregation about 36, followed by 3 and 11 with about 30 of inhibition of amyloid self-aggregation. | Those compounds were about 1.5 less potent than curcumin, which was used as a positive control. | The inhibition percentages of the tested hydrazones are comparable with the IC50 values obtained for 1,4-substituted 4-(1H)-pyridylene-hydrazone-type of inhibitors of fibril building20, pointing to the importance of hydrazine moiety in inhibition of amyloid-β aggregation or fibril destruction. | Generally, all compounds were very good reductants comparable to that of standard antioxidants Trolox and BHT. | Most of the compounds showed better or similar reducing ability to that of BHT, while 7 compounds (1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10) showed better reducing ability compared to Trolox. | Hydrazone derivatives of pyridoxal and pyridine-4-carbaldehyde were generally very potent antioxidants, of which compounds 1, 3 and 4 were two times more potent than Trolox. | The only exception was compound 2 with an NO2-substitued phenylhydrazone group, which was less potent than Trolox. | When it comes to N-acylhydrazone derivatives, only compound 10 had a greater reducing ability compared to Trolox and BHT. | Columns denote FRAP values for a 50 µM compound. | Only compound 6 was not tested due to its poor solubility in assay conditions. | ADME properties Ability to cross the BBB The ability of all of the tested hydrazones to cross the BBB by passive transport was estimated by comparing the calculated values of six physicochemical descriptors of compounds (Table S36) with recommended values obtained for known central nervous system (CNS)-active drugs57,7072. | Although hydrazones 9 and 11 have a larger PSA compared to the recommended value, it can be expected that these compounds would be able to pass the BBB since according to the literature, compounds that violate only one of the six physicochemical properties, could cross the BBB57,72. | According to the model, with the absorption percentage in the range between 72 and 93 (Table S37), all of the compounds would likely be very well-absorbed in the human intestines. | Metabolic stability To determine whether and how fast the compound of interest is metabolised, a metabolic stability of compounds 1, 2, 4, 5, 8 and 12, selected based on their high ability to inhibit the action of AChE, BChE, and BACE1, was determined in vitro in human liver microsomes (Table 3). | According to the values of LBF clearance, the selected hydrazones are moderate or high metabolic stable compounds, which indicates their good bioavailability. | In silico prediction of P450 sub-types (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) inhibition (Table S36) showed that majority of compounds do not inhibit CYP enzymes. | The exception was CYP1A2, which was estimated to be inhibited by as many as seven out of a total of 16 tested compounds. | All of the compounds possessed at least four favourable activities against different causative mechanisms which they exerted in comparable concentration ranges. | In addition, most of the compounds displayed a type of reversible inhibition that included interactions with AChE PAS suggesting that those compounds could be able to prevent the formation of neurotoxic AChEAß complexes. | This study singled out two compounds as the most promising multi-target drugs differing in selectivity towards cholinesterases: 1 as butyrylcholinesterase-selective and 4 as a non-selective cholinesterase inhibitor, but all with high inhibition potency towards BACE1, ability to inhibit amyloid-β self-aggregation, to chelate all three metal cations and high ability to act as antioxidants. | Additionally, the metabolic stability of those compounds should allow them to achieve and maintain sufficient concentrations at their sites of action and to be slowly removed from the body. | The fact that these compounds can be successfully synthesised in conventional and environmentally friendly ways highlights them, especially given their structural scaffold, as good models for structural and functional refinement in terms of multi-target drug development.",

Conclusion The findings of this study suggest that rufinamide exhibits significant neuroprotective effects in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced model of Alzheimers Disease. | Based on the evaluation of various parameters, including memory performance, neuronal integrity, and molecular signalling, it is proposed that the neuroprotective effects may be largely attributed to the activation of the CREB

In animal models, MMP inhibitors demonstrate efficacy in reducing MMP activation and oxidative stress, albeit without impacting CAA progression.67 Furthermore, minocycline treatment (known to have MMP inhibitory properties) in mice significantly decreases haemorrhage frequency and inflammatory markers in the brain without affecting vascular Aβ load.23 In a small group of patients with clinically aggressive CAA, minocycline appeared safe and generally tolerated and was associated with reduced haemorrhage occurrence.68 However, in a recent study of patients with moderate to severe non-CAA cerebral small vessel disease, minocycline treatment showed no correlation with changes in microglial signals as measured by PET-imaging and serum inflammatory markers were unaffected.69 To assess target engagement in a CAA patient population, the recently completed randomised controlled BATMAN trial aims to assess the effect of minocycline on markers of neuroinflammation (IL-6, MCP-1 and IBA-1) and the gelatinase pathway (MMP29 and VEGF) in CSF in patients with sporadic CAA and D-CAA.70 Another potential treatment option is to administer antioxidants, as they support the immune system by protecting cells from oxidative stress and damage caused by free radicals.",

A, D, G, J, M) or to PLDPLC activator Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) (B, E, H, K, N) or PLD inhibitor FIPI (C, F, I, L, O) for 7 DPT and analyzed for injury gap closure (AC); the proportion of proliferative EdU cells (DI) and the proportion of Sox2 neuro-glial progenitors (JO). | Note that the activator of phospholipid (PLDPLC) signaling S1P significantly enhances swimming recovery, injury gap closure, and proportions of proliferating cells (EdU) and neuro-glial progenitors (Sox2) after spinal cord transection in 4M CRISPR tadpoles compared to DMSO-treated controls. | At the same time, the PLD inhibitor FIPI significantly reduces injury gap closure and proportions of proliferating cells (EdU) and neuro-glial progenitors (Sox2). | In contrast, a specific inhibitor of PLD-dependent phospholipid signaling further enhances these deficiencies after SCI. | However, most pharmacological compounds are known to modulate additional signaling pathways to some extent and the predicted role of phosphorylation and subcellular localization of MarcksMarcksl1 needs to be validated. | Pharmacological assays Uninjected and RNP-injected embryos (see above) were incubated in various chemical compounds 3 days post-fertilization for 24 hr at 14C in a dark incubator. | All compounds were solubilized in DMSO and diluted in 0.1 Modified Barths Solution (MBS) (Sive et al., 2000).",

Chemical Reagents Radio immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), phosphatase inhibitor, loading buffer, tween-20, glycine, BCA protein assay kit, diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and goat serum were purchased from Beyotime Biotech, Shanghai, China. | The neuronal promoters and inhibitors for the expression of the mouse Smyd-2 were packaged into recombinant adeno-associated virus (serotype 9) vectors (Genomeditech, Shanghai, China). | After injection, the syringe needle was left in place at the injection site for 3 min before being slowly removed to promote the absorption of the adeno-associated virus and inhibitors. | Smyd-2 knockout in hippocampal neurons has neuroprotective potential against CIROGDR insult, and Smyd-2 overexpression, in turn, could exacerbate CIROGDR impairment. | ML-385 is a novel and specific inhibitor of Nrf-2, which directly binds to the Neh-1 domain of Nrf-2 to reduce its transcriptional activity. | It was confirmed that the Nrf-2 inhibitor effectively abolished the antioxidant effect conferred by Smyd-2 knockout. | To further investigate this, we used DDO-7263, a potent Nrf-2-ARE activator, which blocks the assembly of the 26S proteasome, inhibiting the degradation of ubiquitinated Nrf-2 and promoting its compensatory upregulation. | We focus on Smyd-2 knockout increasing the content of GSH, a potent inhibitor of the peroxidation of phospholipids in OGDR-challenged HT-22 cells. | Erastin was discovered initially as a small-molecule compound that induces ST and RASV-12 tumor cell death and has since been widely used as a ferroptosis-inducing drug in vitro . | It has been shown that Erastin-induced ferroptosis in HT-22 cells can be blocked by Zileuton, a LOX-5 inhibitor, via a reduction in cytoplasmic ROS accumulation . | ML-385 partially reversed the neuroprotective effect of Smyd-2 knockout in the CIR-created hippocampus lesions, characterized by the significantly increased volume of cerebral infarction, more obvious motor impairment, more outstanding cognitive dysfunction, and more heavy ferrous iron accumulation in the hippocampus. | The administration of the Nrf-2 inhibitor ML-385 decreases the expression of anti-ferroptosis proteins in Smyd-2 knockout hippocampus after CIR, including Nrf-2, p-Nrf-2, nuclear Nrf-2, GPX-4, FTH-1, SLC7A11, and NQO-1, while increasing the expression of ferroptosis-related oxidative stress factors 15-LOX and COX-2. | Given the constitutive expression of Smyd-2 in hippocampal neurons and its quick-acting Nrf-2-dependent curative pathway, the regimen of Smyd-2-related compounds will be viable clinically against ischemic stroke.",

      "text_block": "Previously, we developed a microliter-scale high-throughput screening (MSHTS) system using quantum dot (QD) nanoprobes to screen Aβ aggregation inhibitors. | In this study, we appraised the Aβ aggregation inhibitory activity of 210 natural mushrooms from Hokkaido (Japan) and found 11 samples with high activity. | applanata has high Aβ aggregation inhibitory activity, so we performed silica gel column chromatography fractionation and found that fraction 5 (f5) of the EtOAc extract displayed the highest Aβ aggregation inhibitory activity among all mushroom samples. | The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) value was 2.30 µgmL, higher than the EC50 of 10.7 µgmL for rosmarinic acid, a well-known Aβ aggregation inhibitor. | This inhibitory activity decreased with further purification, suggesting that some compounds act synergistically. | Our expectation is that f5, with additional tests, may eventually prove to be an inhibitor for the prevention of AD. | In recent years, researchers from various countries have made considerable progress in screening Aβ aggregation inhibitors, with natural extracts increasingly showing strong Aβ aggregation inhibitory activity . | These bioactive ingredients not only have antioxidant, anti-bacterial, and anti-tumor effects but also show potential neuroprotective properties . | Therefore, edible mushrooms with neuroprotective properties have attracted attention as a possible countermeasure for AD. | Currently, thioflavin T (ThT) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are widely used to evaluate the Aβ aggregation inhibitory activity of various substances and to observe Aβ aggregation . | However, ThT dyes and fluorescent substances may cause internal filtering effects, and inhibitors may compete with ThT for binding to Aβ . | In this study, the purpose was to evaluate the Aβ aggregation inhibitory activity of different species of mushrooms collected in Hokkaido, Japan. | We used this MSHTS system based on QD fluorescence imaging to rapidly and accurately evaluate the Aβ aggregation inhibitory activity of 210 mushrooms. | We found that 11 mushrooms showed high Aβ aggregation inhibitory activities. | With further purification, the ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extract fraction 5 (f5) of Elfvingia applanata (t037) showed the highest inhibitory activity. | In summary, we hope that f5 can be developed into an effective inhibitor for preventing AD in the future. | The most active fraction, f5, was further fractionated, but inhibitory activity decreased. | To verify the MSHTS results of fraction 5 (f5) and fraction 3 of f5 (f5f3), we further evaluated the inhibitory activity of f5 and f5f3 on Aβ aggregation using ThT assay. | Results 3.1. Evaluation of the Aβ Aggregation Inhibitory Activity of 210 Mushroom Species An automated MSHTS system was used to assess the Aβ aggregation inhibitory activity of crude extracts of 210 mushroom species (Supplementary Table S1) collected in Hokkaido, Japan. | Based on the evaluation results, 11 mushrooms with inhibitory activity were selected from among the 210 mushrooms (Figure 1). | In our previous study, we evaluated the Aβ aggregation inhibitory activity of more than 500 plants, of which more than 50 plants, accounting for about 10 of the total, had EC50 values below 0.05 mgmL (50 µgmL), so we decided to use a value below 50 µgmL as the high activity standard . | According to the EC50 values, the values of 11 mushroom extracts were less than 50 µgmL, which showed high Aβ aggregation inhibitory activity (Figure 1B). | We tested the 11 mushroom extracts with Aβ inhibitory activity, using the MTT assay, to verify whether they could inhibit Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells (Figure 2). | The t100 and t020 mushroom extracts significantly increased PC12 cell viability at 50 μgmL, increasing it to 59.98 and 65.26, respectively, indicating that they had the best inhibitory effect on Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells. | Some mushroom extracts presumably contain cytotoxic substances, and even if they have high Aβ aggregation inhibitory activity, cell viability may not necessarily be high. | Therefore, in this study, which also considers functional food applications, we focused on mushroom extracts with high Aβ aggregation inhibitory activity and cell viability enhancing activity. | In order to purify the active ingredients in the extracts, these two crude extracts were dissolved in five different solvents to re-evaluate Aβ aggregation inhibitory activity. | All of them showed high inhibitory activity (Figure 3C). | On the other hand, the activity of the hexane and water fractions was relatively low (Figure 3C), suggesting that the aggregation inhibitors have properties intermediate between hydrophobic and hydrophilic. | 3.4. Evaluation of the Inhibitory Activity of the EtOAc Extract of t037 The t037 and t100 extracts showed high inhibitory activities in Et2O and EtOAc solvents, and the EtOAc extract of t037 had the smallest EC50 value among the 10 samples. | MSHTS analysis showed that f5 had the highest inhibitory activity with an EC50 of 2.30 0.859 µgmL. | MSHTS analysis found that f5f3 had the highest inhibitory activity with an EC50 of 7.26 6.24 µgmL. | However, compared with f5, f5f3s inhibitory activity was reduced (Figure 4A,C,D). | To further verify the inhibitory activity of f5 and f5f3, a ThT assay was also performed on them (Supplementary Figure S1). | Compared with the Aβ group only, f5 and f5f3 reduced the fluorescence intensity in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that f5 and f5f3 have high inhibitory activity against Aβ aggregation toxicity. | This result also suggests that f5 has a higher aggregation inhibitory activity than f5f3, similar to the result of MSHTS (Figure 4A). | These results suggest that some of the compounds of f5 act synergistically through currently unknown mechanisms. | In this study, we analyzed the inhibitory effects of f5 and f5f3 on extracellular Aβ deposition in SH-SY5Y cells, human neuroblastoma cells, to evaluate the effect on human neurons. | These results indicate that both f5 and f5f3 effectively inhibited the deposition of extracellular Aβ in SH-SY5Y cells and that the inhibitory effect of f5f3 was similar to that of f5. | Discussion In this study, the EC50 values of 210 mushrooms were screened, and approximately 5 of them (i.e., 11 species) were found to have high Aβ42 aggregation inhibitory activity. | Next, based on the EC50 results, the EtOAc extract of t037 was selected and further purified through silica gel column chromatography and thin layer chromatography to evaluate the Aβ42 inhibitory activity of the extract. | After the first separation by silica gel column chromatography, f5 had the best inhibitory activity, which was 10 times higher than the crude extract (Figure 4A). | We further separated the compounds with high inhibitory activity in f5 using a second separation step by silica gel column chromatography, but the inhibitory activity of the extracts that were separated decreased (Figure 4A). | To verify the accuracy of this result, ThT was used to verify the Aβ inhibitory activities of the two extracts, f5 and f5f3, and the results were consistent with the MSHTS results (Supplementary Figure S1). | This shows that f5 has multiple active substances with Aβ inhibitory activity, and there is a synergistic effect between them. | Therefore, the Aβ inhibitory activity of f5 was higher than that of f5f3. | Currently, mushroom compounds with anti-AD potential are divided into several categories, including polysaccharides, steroid compounds, triterpenes, alkaloids, and phenols . | In this study, the inhibitory activity of 210 mushrooms collected in Hokkaido was evaluated against Aβ aggregation by using an automated MSHTS system. | We developed this system many years ago to label amyloid proteins with QD fluorescent probes, successfully elucidated the aggregation process of Aβ, tau, α-syn, and other proteins by recording images with real-time fluorescence microscopy, and depicted 3D models of aggregates in 3D images and to screen inhibitors . | In this study, as well as in actual screening results reported in our previous reports, the system can accurately and efficiently evaluate the inhibitory activity, even of crude extracts derived from natural products (plants, mushrooms), as well as various commercial dressings . | In summary, we believe that the MSHTS system will become an important method for detecting amyloid aggregation and screening amyloid aggregation inhibitors. | We will explore the ability of this system to screen amyloid inhibitors to develop therapeutic drugs for amyloid diseases and functional foods for the prevention of AD. | The EC50 of RA is 10.7 µgmL , a well-known Aβ aggregation inhibitor. | However, the activity decreased with further purification, so there may be a synergistic effect of multiple compounds that have not yet been elucidated. | It is also necessary to understand the interactions between the compounds in the fractions and the mechanisms of action on the organism, which will be the subject of the next phase of research. | Conclusions We successfully evaluated the Aβ aggregation inhibitory activity of 210 crude extracts of Hokkaido mushrooms using an automated MSHTS system. | Among them, 11 mushroom extracts had Aβ inhibitory activity, while 6 of them had neuroprotective effects and significantly increased PC12 cell viability. | After solvent separation and purification of two extracts, t037 and t100, the obtained extracts still had good inhibitory activity and neuroprotective properties. | In conclusion, our automated MSHTS system has great potential for screening AD inhibitors. | The Aβ inhibitory activity of f5 was higher than that of other mushrooms. | We hope that f5 may be used as a dietary supplement and Aβ inhibitor for the prevention of AD after multiple experiments.",

      "title": "Betalains: A Narrative Review on Pharmacological Mechanisms Supporting the Nutraceutical Potential Towards Health Benefits",
      "text_block": "In this review, we focused on the main and latest studies on the pharmacological effects and mechanisms of betalains, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, hypolipidemic, antidiabetic, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, anticancer, and antimicrobial properties, in both in vitro and in vivo studies. | The current knowledge broadens the clinical applicability of betalains, making them potential sources of nutraceutical compounds that can be used to develop functional foods. | Introduction Betalains are the main compounds responsible for the red color of flowers, fruits, and other plant tissues, commonly found in plant groups in the order of Caryophyllales. | These compounds have a positive impact on human health, in addition to their mercantile function as food additives and colorants . | The findings revealed the existence of new bioactive compounds primarily in Chenopodium quinoa, suggesting their contribution to the resistance of this species in the face of multiple environmental stressors . | Its antioxidant performance is attributed to its betalain components (betanin) and other phenolic compounds. | The betalains indicaxanthin and betanin were identified as the most abundant compounds in the extracts of the plant. | Betalain pretreatment exerted a cardioprotective effect by limiting inflammation parameters such as the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), IL-6, and chemokine receptor CXCR-4 (C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4) and the expression of the transcriptional regulator STAT3 (Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) . | Inorganic nitrate originating from the diet, such as in beetroot juice, is considered a major active compound because nitric oxide is already well known for its cardio-metabolic effects, which include improving endothelial function and reducing blood pressure . | Dragon fruit and prickly pear do not contain significant amounts of nitrate but are rich in other bioactive compounds such as flavonoids, polyphenols, and vitamins, particularly vitamin C in prickly pear, which also have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities . | Because betalains are major compounds in beetroot juice and cactus pear, some clinical studies have addressed the potential of betalain-rich beetroot supplements to treat cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension. | It was estimated that betalainic compounds correspond to about 85 of all active compounds in Hylocereus polyrhizus fruit . | The exact hypotensive mechanism of betalamic compounds is still not very well known. | As discussed previously in this article, various studies have demonstrated the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of betalain-rich extracts and isolated betalain compounds in different experimental models. | Clinical trials have shown that betalain-rich supplements can significantly lower blood pressure and improve vascular function, though their effects may be synergistic with other compounds, such as nitrates. | These compounds have been shown to effectively lower total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels while increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels in animal and human subjects. | Three varieties of Opuntia ficus-indica rich in betalains show varying effectiveness in reducing the triglyceride accumulation in both 3T3-L1 maturing pre-adipocytes and mature adipocytes, highlighting the potential of these compounds in lipid regulation at the cellular level . | 3.6. Hepatoprotective The liver hosts various physiological processes, including the breakdown of foreign compounds. | The metabolism of xenobiotics in the liver occurs in three phases intended to convert the molecules into more hydrophilic compounds facilitating their excretion. | A study compared the hepatoprotective effect of Opuntia robusta fruit extract (OR, rich in betacyanins, betaxanthins, flavonoids, and other phenolic compounds), betanin, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which is the currently used treatment, against diclofenac-induced acute liver injury. | SIRT1 activators significantly reduced oxidative stress and inflammation by inhibiting the NF-κB and enhancing the Nrf2 pathway, contributing to cytoprotective effects . | Because betalains are widely recognized for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, they have been studied as compounds with great potential in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (Table 7). | In a study using enhanced atomistic simulations to investigate the effects of astaxanthin, betanin, and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on Aβ peptide oligomers (dimer, trimer, tetramer), all three natural compounds inhibit Aβ aggregation by reducing aggregation-prone conformations. | The neuroprotective effects of indicaxanthin seem to derive primarily from its ability to regulate the redox-sensitive activation of the NF-κB and Nrf2 pathways and their associated downstream signaling mechanisms . | Preclinical studies highlight their neuroprotective potential in PD by improving dopaminergic neuron survival and in AD by reducing Aβ aggregation and associated toxicity. | These findings suggest that betalains and related natural compounds could serve as valuable adjunctive treatments in managing neurodegenerative diseases, warranting further investigation in clinical settings. | foods-13-03909-t007_Table 7 Table 7 Summary of neuroprotective mechanisms of betalains in various studies. | Betalains Source Major Compound Disease Model Mechanisms Reference Betanin (isolated compound) Betanin PD model: 6-OHDA and H2O2induced oxidative damage and apoptosis in PC12 cells ROS levels; modulation of SAPKJNK and PI3K pathways to cell survival Betanin (isolated compound) Betanin Rotenone-induced Parkinson-like mice model TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6; MDA; GSH; expression of TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB Betanin (isolated compounds) Betanin REMD simulations and Molecular Docking amyloid-beta aggregation Hylocereus polyrhizus betacyanins Anti-A β aggregation activity and citotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cell culture amyloid-beta aggregation and no citotoxicity Indicaxanthin (isolated compound) Indicaxan-thin High-fat diet-induced neuronal damage in mice expression of proapoptotic genes; expression of antiapoptotic genes; expression of neuroinflammatory genes and proteins; high-fat diet-induced oxidative stress : decreased, : increased. | The anticancer effects of betavulgarin, a compound isolated from beetroot, was explored specifically targeting breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), a subpopulation known for drug resistance, self-renewal, recurrence, and metastasis. | Juice from young shoots showed a stronger inhibitory effect on cancer cell proliferation, particularly in estrogen-dependent cells, and promoted both antiproliferative and apoptotic responses, pointing to the involvement of the internal apoptosis pathway . | Researchers tested betalain-rich extracts and purified compounds, finding that tryptophan-betaxanthin reduced tumor size by 56.4 and increased lifespan by 9.3. The antitumor activity was linked to the modulation of the DAF-16 transcription factor and the insulin signaling pathway . | Betalain Source Major Compound Disease Model Mechanisms Reference Betanin (isolated compound) Betanin Cancer cells Induction of apoptosis through mitochondria, activation of caspases, promotion of DNA fragmentation in cancer cells without affecting normal cells Beta vulgaris Betavulgarin Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) proliferation, migration, colony formation, mammosphere formation, CD44CD24- subpopulation, and self-renewal proteins (C-Myc, Nanog, Oct4) Beta vulgaris (young shootsroot) Betalains Breast cancer cells (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231) cancer cell proliferation, promoted antiproliferative and apoptotic responses, particularly in estrogen-dependent cells Betalain-rich extracts and compounds Tryptophan-betaxanthin Caenorhabditis elegans JK1466 mutants tumor size by 56.4, lifespan by 9.3, modulated DAF-16 transcription factor and insulin signaling pathway Beta vulgaris Chitosan nanoparticles Betalains and chitosan Human lung (A549), breast (T-47D), colorectal (Caco-2) carcinomas 8389 of cancer cells, induced apoptosis and necrosis, expression of apoptotic markers (Caspase 3, P53) Beta vulgaris (hydroalcoholic extract) Betanin Colorectal cancer (Caco-2, HT-29) cancer cell growth (IC50 64107 μgmL), expression of pro-apoptotic genes (BAD, Caspase-3, Caspase-8, Caspase-9, Fas-R), Bcl-2 Beta vulgaris (encapsulated in liposomes) Betanin Photodynamic therapy for cancer Enhanced photosynthetic effect, improved stability and effectiveness, interaction with Bcl-2 proteins to induce apoptosis : decreased, : increased, C-Myc: c-myelocytomatosis, Oct4: octamer-binding transcription factor 4. | After ingesting 500 g of cactus pear pulp, both compounds peaked in plasma concentration after 3 h. | Both compounds were undetectable in plasma after 12 h . | The long-term intake (6 weeks) of fermented beetroot juice by human volunteers showed that during juice consumption, native compounds and twelve betalain metabolites (decarboxylated and dehydrogenated) were found in the blood and urine of volunteers. | Encapsulation and adsorption techniques are promising alternatives to overcome these limitations and improve the stability of bioactive compounds . | Our review emphasizes several studies demonstrating the substantial capacity of these pigments through pharmacologicalnutraceutical mechanisms involved in the antioxidant response, anti-inflammatory, the control of dyslipidemia, glycemic regulation, the maintenance of cardiovascular health, liver protection, neuroprotection, and antitumor and antimicrobial activities (Figure 3). | Investigating synergistic effects with other bioactive compounds and elucidating precise mechanisms of action in humans is also critical.",

(2018) associated the neuroprotective effect of argon with the activation of both the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 12 pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K)-AKT pathway . | Exposure to high concentrations of argon has been shown to cause a neuroprotective effect by suppressing the expression of AKT ; in our study, there was a slight but not statistically significant decrease in the level of this enzyme. | Low levels of ROS may have neuroprotective effects early after ischemic injury, with their accumulation leading to cytotoxicity and Nrf2 activation . | , the mechanism of antioxidant brain protection was thoroughly examined in a rat model of ischemic-hypoxic brain injury, with a focus on the role of argon as an activator of this neuroprotective mechanism. | In another large study on in vitro and in vivo models, it was shown that treatment with argon in combination with hypothermia has a pronounced neuroprotective effect under conditions of hypoxic damage to neuronal cells, which is accompanied, among other things, by an increase in the expression of HO-1, and that its inhibition levels this effect. | The only study that examined the neuroprotective properties of argon and the role of Hif1α in their implementation was conducted on a model of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) by Höllig A. | Further investigation into the mechanisms of argons neuroprotective effect in a TBI model showed that on the 4th day after TBI, the level of Hif1α in the argon group was two times lower than in the TBI group. | Additionally, the protective effect of argon against cell death was diminished in the presence of an NF-κB inhibitor called Bay11-7082 . | Argon treatment has been found to effectively suppress the upregulation of TLR24, NF-κB, and various pro-inflammatory factors like IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and iNOS after trauma However, this inhibitory effect was reversed by TLR24 inhibitors . | In the groups used for investigating the molecular mechanisms of the neuroprotective effects of inhalation, 2 h inhalations were performed once in the Int. | The brain hemispheres were homogenized in PBS at pH 7.4 (Amresco, Cleveland, OH, USA) supplemented with 1 mM protease inhibitor PMSF (Amresco, USA). | Conclusions Inhalations of an argon-oxygen gas mixture (Ar 70O2 30) with a 2 h exposure duration, repeated three times, demonstrate a neuroprotective effect on open traumatic brain injuries. | The molecular mechanisms underlying argons neuroprotective effect in the context of preconditioning are mediated by the activation of the AKT and Nrf2 signaling pathways.",

      "text_block": "Introduction An active area of research in neuropharmacology seeks to identify natural compounds that can be used to treat common neurodegenerative diseases. | Despite variations, the analysis of phenotype variance and similarity allowed us to identify ROT-treated rats with varying degrees of benefit from consuming Nano-PSO, whether it was used as a neuroprotective or neurorestorative agent. | Our objective was to identify rats that might benefit from the consumption of Nano-PSO, used as a neuroprotective or neurorestorative agent, when it was administered before or after receiving ROT, even if such benefits were inconsistently observed in a heterogeneous population of rats. | The degree of neuroprotection achieved varied significantly among rats, with only some displaying nearly normal MoPs. Interestingly, while intact rats performed similarly across both tests, some neuro-protected and neuro-restored rats showed better performance in the first test, while others improved in the second test, as indicated by the orientation of the ellipses in the PCA dimensional space. | The degree of neuroprotection varies among rats, with none maintaining MrPs close to normal values. | Additionally, neuroprotection is not homogeneous; in some rats, it progresses better in the left SNpc than in the right, while in others, the opposite occurs. | The relative neuroprotective effect of Nano-PSO was, however, insufficient to reinstate MrP variability in the population of neuro-protected rats. | The combined results suggest that Nano-PSO provides some degree of neuroprotection, although its extent is insufficient to maintain normal dopaminergic neuron numbers. | Overall, these results suggest that Nano-PSO offers neuroprotection and neuro-restoration against α-syn accumulation in the CaNu and SNpc. | In addition, the effects of ROT toxicity, neuroprotection, and neuro-restorationmonitored through α-syn availabilitydemonstrate individual regionalization. | These combined results indicate that while Nano-PSO provides some degree of neuroprotection and neuro-restoration, this is insufficient to maintain normal levels of α-syn availability. | For both SNpc and CaNu DPs, the extent of neuro-restoration and neuroprotection showed individual variability. | Although the results suggest that Nano-PSO provides some degree of neuro-restoration and, to a lesser extent, neuroprotection, the level of improvement achieved is insufficient to maintain DPs within the normal range. | The degree of neuro-restoration and neuroprotection was moderate, although it varied among individuals. | The observation that neuro-protected, neuro-restored, and intact rats cluster distinctly from ROT-administered rats suggests that Nano-PSO exerts neuroprotective and neuro-restorative effects. | While the results suggest that Nano-PSO provides some degree of neuro-restoration and, to a lesser extent, neuroprotection, the overall improvement achieved is insufficient to maintain the TPs within the normal range. | These results support the theory that Nano-PSO provides some degree of neuroprotection and neuro-restoration; the effect, nonetheless, varies notably across specimens individually. | Despite the extensive overlapping of GTCPs, Nano-PSO provides some degree of neuroprotection and neuro-restoration, the effects being remarkably individually variable. | Discussion The search for natural compounds to prevent, slow down, attenuate, or reverse neurodegenerative processes is a constant task in neuropharmacology (e.g., ). | To address the technical limitations of conducting a longitudinal study while enabling inter-individual comparisons, we devised a series of phenotypes and profiles as biomarkers to assess the relative deterioration, neuroprotection, or neuro-restoration effect following ROT administration, with or without Nano-PSO supplementation. | Nevertheless, it was consistently possible to identify ROT-treated rats that benefited from Nano-PSO supplementation, whether it was used as a neuroprotective or neurorestorative agent. | Indeed, Nano-PSO provides neuroprotection or neuro-restoration to varying degrees, depending on each individuals response to the supplementation and the parameters used to monitor their improvement or deterioration. | Considering the phenotypic variability in the neurodegeneration landscape and the individuality that characterizes the natural history of these diseases, the non-categorical interpretation of both basic and clinical studies may expedite the identification of new compounds that could benefit the distinct phenotypes of those patients who are already experiencing neurodegeneration and those susceptible to developing it . | In our experiments, although ROT administration tended to reduce phenotype variation among the rat population, Nano-PSO increased it, whether being employed as a neurorestorative or a neuroprotective agent. | Moreover, the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and pharmaco-(epi)genetics of Nano-PSO (and ROT) must be elucidated to better understand the mechanisms involved in the responses (and their diversity) of the brain and body to both compounds. | Nano-PSO (GranaGardTM, Granalix Bio Technologies, Ltd., Jerusalem, Israel) was administered orally daily (910 a.m.) using a syringe, with the intention to provide either neuroprotection (Nano-PSOROT) or neuro-restoration (ROTNano-PSO). | The samples (25 mg) were sonicated (20 Hz; 3 times1 min each at 4 C) in 100 µL of PBS (0.02 M; pH 7.4), supplemented with the complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Cat. | Then, the CaNu and SNpc samples were dissected under microscopic guidance, rinsed in PBS (0.02 M;

Effect of SIRT1 Blockage on PF-Related Improvements of NF-κB, NLRP3 Inflammasome and Pyroptosis In order to further explore the role of SIRT1 signaling in PF-related antidepressants, EX-527, a SIRT1-specific inhibitor, was used in this study. | Then, we verified whether SIRT1 signaling also regulated the inhibitory effect of PF on the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. | Similarly, the immunofluorescence image of GSDMD-N showed that the inhibitory effect of PF on the expression of pyroptosis-related protein GSDMD-N in the CA3 area of mouse hippocampus induced by CUMS was obviously weakened by the treatment of EX-527 (Figure 7B,D). | These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of PF-related inactivation of NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis depended on SIRT1 signal transduction (Figure 7A,B). | In order to further explore the antidepressant mechanism of paeoniflorin, SIRT1 inhibitor EX-527 was used in animal experiment 2 and BV2 cells. | Here, we proved the inhibitory effect of PF on GSDMD-mediated microglia pyroptosis. | Moreover, SIRT1 inhibitor EX-527 hindered the protective effect of paeoniflorin in LPSATP-treated cells and CUMS-induced mice and promoted the expression of NF-κB, NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1, IL-1β and GSDMD-N. | In this study, we found that the activation of SIRT1NF-κB induced by PF significantly reduced the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome complex and its induced pyroptosis in CUMS mice and BV2 cells, while SIRT1 inhibitors blocked these effects. | 4.7.2.

      "text_block": "It is noteworthy that compounds 11 and 12 demonstrated efficient binding to both AChE and MAO-A, while compounds 3 and 10 significantly reduced MAO-B and AChE aggregation in vitro. | These findings provide structural templates for the development of dual MAO and AChE inhibitors for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. | AChE inhibitors that bind to either the PAS or both the CAS and PAS may simultaneously alleviate cognitive deficits and delay the neurodegenerative process by preventing the aggregation of Aβ peptides . | Therapeutic options include one N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist (memantine) and three hAChE inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine). | A lot of hAChE and hMAO-B inhibitors with good therapeutic effects have been reported . | Among the compounds identified, ladostigil, which was designed using a combination of two pharmacophores taken from rivastigmine and rasagiline is currently in phase IIb clinical trials , which encourages us to further search for other new multi-target molecules with hAChE and hMAO-B inhibitory activity. | Therefore, the combined effects of Ensaculin on neurotransmitter systems and its potential neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties make it an intriguing and promising candidate in the search for a drug to treat AD. | Based on the structural features of Ensaculin, several researchers have attempted to incorporate various structural moieties into the coumarin scaffold to develop hAChE inhibitors . | Substituents such as phenyl, methyl, carboxylic acid, ethyl ester, or acyl chloride at the C-3 position resulted in potent MAO inhibitors . | Additionally, it can occupy the substrate cavity of hMAO-B, thus exhibiting potent hMAO-B inhibitory activity . | In turn, the nitrogen atom in the phenylpiperazine group acts as the positive charge center, which is a feature commonly found in many potent hAChE inhibitors. | Considering these factors, we developed small molecules with effective multi-target action against AD, validating their efficacy through in silico and in vitro studies. | The compounds were designed to incorporate coumarin structures known to exhibit MAO-B inhibition and selected structural elements of Ensaculin for selective hAChE inhibition. | To rationalize the molecular basis for the observed biological activity, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in an explicit solvent system were performed to assess the dynamic behavior, stability, and conformational transitions of the new hybrid compounds within the binding sites of hAChE, hMAO-A, and hMAO-B. | In the next step, the final compounds were synthesized according to a previously published study . | The synthesis of compounds 112 was carried out by reacting the bromoalkyl derivatives with the appropriate arylpiperazine: 4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine or 4-(3-methoxyphenyl)piperazine in acetonitrile in the presence of potassium iodide and potassium carbonate. | All compounds synthesized in this work were prepared using a microwave reactor and purified using column chromatography with silica gel. | Characterization of the compounds was performed using 1H NMR, 13C NMR spectroscopy, and HRMS spectrometry. | Scheme 1 shows the synthesis of the two new compounds, 1 and 2. | The synthesis schemes and detailed data for compounds 312 are included in our previously published works . | The NMR spectra for two new compounds, 1 and 2, are presented in Figures S1 and S2 (see Supplementary Materials). | 2.2. Molecular Docking of Coumarin Derivatives with hAChE Docking studies were performed to gain further insight into the binding mode of the coumarin derivatives and to elucidate the impact of structural modifications on the inhibitory activities of the compounds against hAChE. | For the docking procedure, the structure of 4EY7 was obtained from the RCSB as a complex bound with the inhibitor donepezil. | As shown in Figure 2, all coumarin derivatives (112) were found to fit in the gorge of hAChE formed by CAS and PAS and surrounded by the residues Gln-71, Thr-83, Asn-87, Pro-88, Ser-125, Ala-127, Leu-130, Gly-148, Gln-291, Glu-292, Ser-293, Val-294, Tyr-337, and Ile-451, revealing a similar binding orientation as that of reference inhibitor donepezil . | In almost all the test compounds (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 11), the coumarin moiety was bound to the CAS of the enzyme, while the rest of the molecule (composed of alkyl chains, piperazine, and benzene rings) was directed toward the anionic site (PAS), accounting for the differences in binding modes (Figure 2B). | Tested compounds were held in the binding site by a combination of hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals interactions with their surroundings. | In the case of the hAChE model, for the best-docked positions of the coumarin derivatives, strong hydrogen bonding interactions were observed, except for compounds 9 and 7. | Specifically, interactions were observed with the residues Gly-120, Tyr-124, and Tyr-133 for compounds 5, 6, and 11; Tyr-72, Tyr-133, and Ser-293 for compound 8; Tyr-124, Ser-293, and Arg-296 for compound 10; Tyr-133 and Phe-295 for compound 12; Glu-202 for compounds 1, 3, and 4; and Ser-293 for compound 2. | In addition, all compounds exhibited carbonhydrogen bonds due to the presence of several residues, such as Asp-74, Gly-121, Tyr-124, Gly-126, Glu-202, Ser-293, Val-294, Arg-296, Gly-448, Tyr-337, Tyr-341, and His-447, in the vicinity of the ligand. | Moreover, all the compounds showed hydrophobic interactions, such as ππ stacked, πalkyl, alkyl, πsigma, and πcation. | The ππ interaction with residues Trp-86 and Trp-286 was observed for compounds 2, 6, 11, 8, 9, and 12; the interaction with residues Leu-289 and His-447 was observed for compounds 2 and 10; the interaction with residues Phe-297, Tyr-72, Tyr-337, and Val-291 was observed for compound 2; and the interaction with residues His-447 and Tyr-337 was observed for compound 3. | The πcation interaction was observed with Asp-74 and Tyr-341 for compounds 1, 3, 4, and 6. | Additionally, the πsigma interaction with Val-294 was observed for compound 4; and the interaction with Tyr-341 was observed for compound 7. | The formation of unfavorable bonds was noticed for compound 9 between the carbonyl oxygen of the coumarin moiety and residue Gly-120. | Thus, in most of the potent compounds, hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions were primarily responsible for mediating inhibitory action against hAChE. | Therefore, in further research, we focused our attention only on the binding mode of the most active inhibitors: compounds 10, 11, and 12. | 2.3. Molecular Docking of Coumarin Derivatives with hMAOs Compounds 112, most of which are 5-hydroxycoumarin derivatives, were also investigated for their inhibitory effects on monoamine oxidase. | This study was conducted through the differential docking of the compounds into the structure of hMAO-A with the 7-methoxy-1-methyl-9H-β-carboline (harmine)-bound ligand (PDB code: 2Z5X) and hMAO-B in complex with 7-(3-chlorobenzyloxy)-4-(methylamino)methylcoumarin (PDB code: 2V61). | Based on the literature data, it was found that residues Tyr-326 (located in the side chain of MAO-B) and Ile-335 (located in the side chain of MAO-A), situated at the junction of the substrate and entrance cavity, play a crucial role in the substrateinhibitor selectivity of the two MAO isoforms. | Specifically, Tyr-326 prevents the binding of MAO-A selective inhibitors to the MAO-B active site, thus contributing to the selectivity toward either MAO-A or MAO-B . | Evaluation of the virtual ligandenzyme complexes of all coumarin derivatives within the catalytic site of MAO-A revealed that all tested compounds occupied the active site of MAO-A. | The best-ranked docking solutions of compounds 112 within the active site of MAO-A indicate that the coumarin moiety of all compounds binds in the polar region of the substrate cavity, near the FAD cofactor site. | The residues Tyr-69, Phe-352, Tyr-407, and Tyr-444 formed the bottom of the aromatic cage, which determined the binding orientation of the compounds and consequently influenced their activity, binding affinity, selectivity, and stability. | All compounds exhibited one or more hydrogen bonding interactions, except for compounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9. | Additionally, all the compounds demonstrated ππ interactions, except for the least active MAO-A inhibitors, i.e., compounds 2, 5, 6, and 9. | Therefore, it can be inferred that the reduced activity of these compounds against MAO-A may be attributed to the absence of hydrogen bonding interactions. | Furthermore, in the active compounds, namely, 11 and 12, hydrogen bonding and ππ interactions were observed to play a significant role in mediating MAO-A inhibition. | The best docking pose of compound 12 involved a hydrogen bond with Gly-110 and ππ interactions with Tyr-407, Ile-180, and Ile-335 of MAO-A. | This arrangement closely resembled the binding sites of the coumarin derivative 7-(3-chlorobenzyloxy)-4-(methylamino)methylcoumarin, which is a reference MAO-B inhibitor (Figure 4A). | Hydrogen-bonding interactions with Gln-206, Tyr-435, and Ile-198 were observed for compounds 5, 10, 11, and 12; interactions with Pro-104, Ile-198, and Leu-171 were observed for compound 3; interactions with Gly-58, Tyr-326, Pro-102, Arg-42, and Ile-199 were observed for compound 4; interactions with Gly-58, Cys-172, Lys-296, and Tyr-398 were observed for compound 7; interactions with Gly-434 and Gln-206 were observed for compound 2; interactions with Pro-104, Ile199, and Gln-206 were observed for compound 1; interactions with residue Ile-198 were observed for compounds 8 and 9; and interactions with residues Leu-171 and Gln-206 were observed for compound 6. | Additionally, all compounds showed ππ interactions, except compounds 8 and 12. | The ππ interactions were observed with Tyr-326 for compounds 1, 2, 3, and 9; interactions with Tyr-398 were observed for compounds 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11; interactions with Tyr-435 were observed for compounds 1, 2, 3, and 7; and interactions with Gly-57 were observed for compounds 4 and 10. | Additionally, πσ interactions have been observed with Ile-199 for compounds 2, 3, 5, and 11; interactions with Tyr-398 have been observed for compounds 3 and 4; and interactions with Gly-58 have been observed for compound 9. | 2.4. Biological Profile of Coumarin Derivatives as Potential Drugs for Treatment of AD 2.4.1. Evaluation of hAChE Inhibitory Activity As shown in Table 1, arylpiperazinyl derivatives of coumarin displayed varied hAChE inhibitory activity compared to the reference compound Ensaculin. | Compounds 19 did not show significant activity, with inhibition values ranging from 46 for compound 7 to 61 for compounds 1 and 2. | Only derivatives of 8-acetyl-7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin exhibited hAChE inhibitory activity. | For the 3-methoxyphenyl moiety, both compounds with a three-carbon and four-carbon linkers were active, with IC50 values of 2.80 μM for 8-acetyl-7-3-propoxy-4-methylchromen-2-one (11) and 4.95 μM for 8-acetyl-7-4-butoxy-4-methylchromen-2-one (12). | Additionally, compound 11, with a three-carbon linker, exhibited better hAChE inhibitory activity than compound 12, with a four-carbon linker. | 2.4.2. Evaluation of hMAOs Inhibitory Activity Compounds 11 and 12 showed a good inhibitor profile against hMAO-A, with IC50 values of 6.97 μM and 7.65 μM, respectively, compared to the reference compound, pargyline (IC50 10.9 μM). | This indicates that in terms of MAO-A inhibitory activity, only derivatives of 8-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin exhibited activity, while derivatives of 5-hydroxy and 6-acetyl-5-hydroxycoumarin had no effect. | Replacing (3-methoxyphenyl)piperazine with (2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine resulted in a drastic decrease in the activity of compounds. | In the case of inhibitory activity against MAO-B, the situation was completely different. | The highest activity was found for compounds 1, 3, 4, and 9 (Table 1), with the following values: 3 (IC50 1.88 μM) 1 (IC50 2.18 μM) 4 (IC50 3.18 μM) 9 (IC50 4.76 μM). | The derivatives of 4,7-dimethyl-5-hydroxycoumarin with the three-carbon linker (3 and 1) were the most active, with compound 3, containing a 3-methoxyphenyl moiety, performing the best. | The introduction of the 2-methoxyphenyl moiety only slightly affected the activity, changing from IC50 1.88 μM for compound 3 to IC50 2.18 μM for compound 1. | Similarly, extending the linker between the coumarin and piperazine moiety from three carbons to four carbons changed the activity from IC50 1.88 μM for compound 3 to IC50 3.18 μM for compound 4. | In the group of 8-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin derivatives, only 8-acetyl-7-3-propoxy-4-methylchromen-2-one (9) showed activity at the level of pargyline (IC50 4.76 μM for compound 9, compared to IC50 2.69 μM for pargyline). | 2.5. Molecular Dynamics Analysis of hAChE Inhibitors 2.5.1. Pose Analysis and Binding Mode of hAChE Inhibitors 1012 As indicated by the biological results, 7-O-arylpiperazinylcoumarins (10, 11, and 12) showed selective hAChE inhibitory activity. | Molecular dynamics were employed to gain insight into the binding modes of these compounds. | The binding free energy values for compounds 1012 that were calculated using the MM-GBSA method are presented in Table 1, together with the experimental values IC50 against hAChE. | Compound 10, which exhibited the lowest binding energy (77.24 kcalmol), emerged as the most potent hAChE inhibitor among the selected coumarin derivatives, which is consistent with the experimental study (IC50 1.52 μM). | Compounds 10 and 12, with a butylene linker, are predicted to be accommodated in the hAChE pocket in extended conformations, whereas compound 11, with a propylene linker, adopted a folded conformation. | Furthermore, it was observed that the coumarin moiety of compounds 10 and 12 is oriented toward the PAS of the enzyme, whereas in compound 11, the coumarin moiety is positioned in the CAS region. | The butoxy derivative 10 with the 2-methoxyphenyl substituent, which is one of the most potent hAChE inhibitors among the tested coumarin series, shows favorable interactions within the binding site. | Moreover, the coumarin moiety of compound 10 occupies the PAS of hAChE and engages in double ππ stacking interactions with the indole ring of Trp-286 (distances of 4.05 and 5.07 Å) and a π-alkyl interaction with Leu-289 (distance of 4.23 Å). | On the other hand, the 3-methoxyphenyl moiety of compound 12 binds to the CAS region, where it engages in a hydrophobic interaction with residues Trp-86 (5.02 Å) and Ile-451 (5.39 Å). | Another interesting case is represented by compound 11, with a propylene linker and a 3-methoxyphenyl substituent. | In this compound, there is an inversion of the binding mode compared to compounds 10 and 12. | In compound 11, the coumarin moiety is bound to the catalytic anionic site (CAS), exhibiting a hydrophobic interaction with the quaternary ammonium binding locus Trp-86 (lengths of 4.84 and 4.92 Å). | Taken together, all these results suggest that compounds 10, 11, and 12 could occupy the entire enzyme active sites, acting as dual-binding site inhibitors of hAChE. | The higher potency of the compounds with 7-O-arylpiperazinylcoumarin could be attributed to more favorable interactions with the target enzyme. | Therefore, to observe the motion of ligands in the enzymes active site, we performed MD simulations to explore different conformations and assess the stability of the inhibitorhAChE complexes. | From the twelve compounds evaluated, three C7-coumarin derivatives (10, 11, and 12) were selected for MD simulation analysis based on the agreement of experimental and computational evidence regarding their conformations with the hAChE enzyme. | It can be observed that the RMSD deviation amplitude for compounds 10 and 11 in the complex with hAChE is greater compared to the stability observed in the compound 12-hAChE complex. | However, after 20 ns, the complexes began to stabilize, indicating the compounds stable behavior through the strong inhibition of the target and explicit binding to the active site. | Afterward, we analyzed the RMSF to investigate the fluctuations of each residue in the enzyme complexed with three compounds, 10, 11, and 12, during the simulations. | The RMSF of the protein showed flexibility within a range of 0.097 to 0.115 nm for all three compounds (Figure 6BD). | The amino acid residues in the protein side chain for compound 10, specifically, Gly-120, Gly-256, Thr-262, and Gly-264 (Figure 6B); compound 11, specifically, Ser-30, Leu-138, Gly-230, Leu-281, Leu-398, and Lys-538 (Figure 6C); and compound 12, specifically, Ser-57, Thr-109, Ala-160, Gly-264, Leu-281, Glu-292, and Ala-542 (Figure 6D), showed fluctuations of more than 0.108 nm due to their positions on the proteins outer exposed surface. | 2.6. Molecular Dynamics Analysis of hMAOs Inhibitors 2.6.1. Pose Analysis and Binding Mode of hMAO-A Inhibitors 11 and 12 Biological results indicate that 7-O-arylpiperazinylcoumarins (compounds 11 and 12) exhibited selective inhibitory effects not only on hAChE but also on hMAO-A. | To gain further insight into their selective hMAO-A inhibitory activity, the binding modes of compounds 11 and 12 in hMAO-A were examined using molecular dynamics. | Compound 11, with the propylene linker and the 3-methoxyphenyl substituent, is a potent hMAO-A inhibitor, with an IC50 value of 6.67 0.76 μM. | It is approximately 1.2-fold more potent than compound 12 (8-acetyl-7-4-butoxy-4-methylchromen-2-one), which shows an IC50 of 7.65 0.32 μM. | The coumarin rings of both compounds were similarly located within the hydrophobic binding pocket of hMAO-A, interacting with the side chains of Ile-180, Ile-335, and Tyr-407. | Additionally, the acetyl group at the 8-position in compound 12 and the methyl group at the 4-position in compound 11 form πsigma interactions with Phe-352 (at distances of 3.94 Å and 3.90 Å, respectively). | The carbonyl group of the coumarin ring in compound 11 formed strong hydrogen bonds with Tyr-444 (2.39 Å) and Asn-181 (2.64 Å). | Compound 11 with a propylene linker is predicted to be accommodated in the MAO-A pocket in an extended conformation, as is compound 12 with a butylene linker. | The piperazine moiety of both compounds exhibited hydrogen-bonding interactions with the residues Ala-111 and Phe-208, with distances ranging from 2.41 to 3.00 Å. | Additional πalkyl interactions were observed between the piperazine moiety of compound 11 and Leu-97, Cys-323, Ala-111, and Val-210, with lengths of 4.51, 5.26, 4.40, and 3.94 Å, respectively. | Moreover, the phenyl substituent of both compounds forms ππ stacking and πalkyl interactions with residues Ala-111, Val-210, and Gly-110. | The methoxy group at the 3-position of the phenyl ring forms a stronger hydrogen bond with Ser-209 (2.09 Å) in compound 11 compared to compound 12, which interacts with residue Gly-110 (2.46 Å). | 2.6.2. Pose Analysis and Binding Mode of hMAO-B Inhibitor 1, 3 and 4 A series of 5-O-arylpiperazinylcoumarin and 7-O-arylpiperazinylcoumarin derivatives were evaluated as monoamine oxidase B inhibitors. | Among these, compounds 1 (IC50 2.18 μM), 3 (IC50 1.88 μM), and 4 (IC50 3.18 μM) exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity and the highest selectivity for MAO-B. | As noted in Table 1, among the studied proteinligand complexes, the C5-substituted coumarin derivatives, specifically compounds 1, 3, and 4, in complex with MAO-B exhibited the most negative binding free energy values, indicating stronger binding affinities, which correlates well with the experimental data. | Figure 8 illustrates the intermolecular interactions of compounds 1, 3, and 4 with the binding site residues of the MAO-B enzyme. | By analyzing the interactions of compounds 1, 3, and 4 with the MAO-B binding site, it can be observed that the coumarin moiety of compound 4, which has a butylene linker, unlike compounds 1 and 3 with propylene linkers, is located in the substrate cavity. | These interactions contribute to the stable binding of compound 4 within the MAO-B active site. | The 3-methoxyphenyl moiety of compound 4 occupied the entrance cavity of MAO-B and interacts with several residues through hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic interactions. | These interactions collectively contribute to the stabilization and binding of compound 4 within the MAO-B enzymes entrance cavity. | The binding mode of compounds 1 and 3 with a propylene linker positions the ligands within the central region of MAO-Bs active site, which is known for effective inhibitor binding. | Specifically, compound 3 with the 3-methoxyphenyl moiety shows a similar energetically favorable orientation as compound 1, which has a 2-methoxyphenyl moiety positioned in the binding pocket. | This orientation suggests that both compounds utilize the same binding interactions within the MAO-B active site, contributing to their inhibitory activity. | Meanwhile, the (2- or 3-methoxyphenyl)piperazine moiety of the compounds is positioned within the substrate pocket and the region between these two cavities. | This arrangement aligns well with the predictions from the docking calculations, highlighting how these compounds interact within the MAO-B binding site to exert their inhibitory effects. | The coumarin ring of both compounds forms πalkyl and πsigma interactions with residues Ile-199 and Ile-316 and hydrogen bonds with Pro-104 (in the range from 2.49 to 2.63 Å). | In compound 3, the arylpiperazinyl chain is further stabilized by hydrogen bonds with Ile-198 (2.56 Å), Leu-171 (2.67 and 2.76 Å), and Gln-206 (2.37 Å). | These interactions contribute to a higher affinity compared to compound 1, enhancing its binding to the MAO-B active site. | Moreover, the folded conformation of compound 3 allowed for favorable interactions of the 3-methoxyphenyl substituents with Tyr-398, Tyr-435, and Gly-434. | The binding modes of the compounds were analyzed in terms of the RMSD deviations of the ligands throughout the simulation time from the starting input structure. | These results suggest that the conformations of the tested compounds in complex with MAO-B varied at different stages of the MD simulation but ultimately stabilized. | To understand the mobility of the MAO-B enzyme in the presence of compounds 1, 3, and 4 within its binding site, RMSF analysis is crucial. | As shown in Figure 9BD, for the complexes of compounds 1, 3, and 4 with protein, fluctuations ranging from 0.12 to 0.14 nm were observed in the RMSF for each residue surrounding the ligand. | Apart from this, the RMSF values of catalytic residues such as Lys-296, orient keeper residues such as Tyr-326, Tyr-398, and Tyr-435, and gate residues such as Ile-199 were found to be very low, suggesting strong intermolecular interactions with the compounds 1, 3, and 4 in the ligandMAO-B complex. | 3.1.2. General Procedure for the Preparation of Compounds 112 The synthesis processes for new compounds 1 and 2 involved two steps. | In the first step, a mixture of 5-hydroxy-4,7-dimethylcoumarin (0.190 g, 1 mmol), 1,3-dibrompropane or 1,4-dibromobutane (0.34 cm3, 3 mmol of 1,3-dibrompropane for compound 1; 0.36 cm3, 3 mmol of 1,4-dibromobutane for compound 2), anhydrous K2CO3 (0.1 g), and a catalytic amount of KI was placed in a microwave flask. | For derivatives 3 and 4, the starting compound in the first step was 5-hydroxy-4,7-dimethylcoumarin (1 mmol) combined with 1,3-dibromopropane or 1,4-dibromobutane (3 mmol), respectively. | In the second step, 3-methoxyphenylpiperazine (2 mmol) was used for both compounds 3 and 4. | In the first step, 1,3-dibromopropane (3 mmol) was used for compounds 5 and 7, while 1,4-dibromobutane (3 mmol) was used for compounds 6 and 8. | To obtain derivatives 912, 8-acetyl-7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (1 mmol) was used as the starting compound in the first step, along with either 1,3-dibromopropane (3 mmol) for compounds 9 and 11 or 1,4-dibromobutane (3 mmol) for compounds 10 and 12. | 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra for compounds 312 are available in the ESI; spectra for compounds 34 and 78 are available in ; spectra for compounds 56 are available in ; spectra for compounds 910 are available in ; and spectra for compounds 1112 are available in . | Briefly, the enzyme was incubated at 25 C with an inhibitor (10 μM for single-point assay and 7 concentrations ranging from 30 to 0.01 μM for IC50 determinations) and chromophoric reagent 5,5-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in phosphate buffer with a pH of 8.0. After the addition of substrate acetylthiocholine, the increase in absorbance was read at 412 nm for 5 min and compared with a control sample devoid of inhibitor. | The structure of MAO-A with the highest resolution (PDB ID: 2Z5Y, resolution 2.1 Å), bound to the known inhibitor harmine was selected . | 3.3.2. Preparation of Ligands Twelve compounds were selected and studied (Figure 1): 4,7-dimethyl-5-coumarin) (1), 4,7-dimethyl-5-coumarin (2), 4,7-dimethyl-5-coumarin) (3), 4,7-dimethyl-5-coumarin (4), 6-acetyl-4,7-dimethyl-5-coumarin (5), 6-acetyl-4,7-dimethyl-5-coumarin (6), 6-acetyl-4,7-dimethyl-5-coumarin (7), 6-acetyl-4,7-dimethyl-5-coumarin (8), 8-acetyl-7-3-propoxy-4-methylchromen-2-one) (9), 8-acetyl-7-4-butoxy-4-methylchromen-2-one) (10), 8-acetyl-7-3-propoxy-4-methylchromen-2-one) (11), and 8-acetyl-7-4-butoxy-4-methylchromen-2-one) (12). | They belong to two groups of coumarin derivatives, which differ in the length of the linker between the coumarin and the piperidine rings: compounds 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 have propylene chains, and compounds 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 have butylene chains. | The geometries of all compounds were optimized using the density functional theory (DFT) with B3LYP6-311G hybrid functional, as implemented in Gaussian 16 . | Arylpiperazinyl derivatives of coumarin exhibited varied hAChE inhibitory activity compared to the reference compound, Ensaculin. | The results showed that most of these compounds exhibited high inhibitory activity and selectivity for hAChE and hMAO-B compared to hMAO-A. | The biological results showed that compound 8-acetyl-7-4-butoxy-4-methylchromen-2-one (10) (IC50 1.52 μM) was the most potent derivative for hAChE, while compounds 8-acetyl-7-3-propoxy-4-methylchromen-2-one (11) and 4,7-dimethyl-5-coumarin (3) exhibited the highest inhibitory activity against hMAOs (IC50 6.97 μM for hMAO-A11 and IC50 1.88 μM for hMAO-B3). | Our results confirmed the peculiar feature of coumarin substitution patterns, particularly that 8-substitution is detrimental to MAO-B activity while leading to selective MAO-A inhibitors . | Among these coumarin derivatives, compounds 11 and 12 exhibited potent and balanced inhibitory activity against both hAChE and hMAO-A. | Enzyme inhibition data and molecular modeling studies revealed that these compounds could bind simultaneously to the PAS and CAS of hAChE as well as occupy the substrate binding site in hMAO. | The simulation analyses of these inhibitors suggest specific prerequisites for the rational or intuitive design of inhibitors. | Based on in silico and in vitro studies, compounds 3 and 10 have been found to exhibit excellent pharmacokinetic properties and strong AChEMAO-B inhibitory activity, making them promising candidates for further investigation.",

      "text_block": "However, limited research has focused on its neurotrophic impact, particularly on neuronal maturation and synaptic development. | This study investigates the neurotrophic effects of F. | Network pharmacology analysis revealed that FVSE components influence critical neurotrophic pathways, including PI3K-AKT and Alzheimers disease pathways. | In conclusion, this study highlights the neurotrophic properties of FVSE, with anethole emerging as a critical bioactive compound. | Moreover, chronic neuroinflammation driven by prolonged activation of glial cells exacerbates neuronal damage, further underscoring the need for neuroprotective strategies that can also mitigate inflammation alongside neurotrophic therapies . | A decline in neurotrophic factors (NTFs), including nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), is a hallmark of NDs. These NTFs are essential for neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function across various neurodegenerative conditions, not limited to Alzheimers disease (AD) . | Restoring or enhancing neurotrophic factor (NTF) signaling has the potential to slow disease progression by promoting neuronal growth, synaptic repair, and survival . | Thus, targeting NTFs or mimetics that can activate neurotrophic pathways holds promise for treatments aimed at improving cognitive function and quality of life in ND patients . | Phytochemicals can interact with neuroinflammatory mediators and neurotrophic factors (NGF, BDNF, NT-3, and NT-5) , making them promising candidates for therapeutic applications. | Specifically, some phytochemicals are known to activate key neuroprotective pathways, such as the PI3K-AKT and Erk12 pathways, which are essential for neuronal survival, differentiation, and synaptic plasticity. | vulgare may help alleviate memory deficits and reduce stress, potentially due to its neuroprotective and anti-stress properties . | vulgares antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties are believed to support neuroprotection by modulating oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which play key roles in the pathogenesis of NDs. Identifying the molecular mechanisms by which fennel exerts its neuroprotective effects could pave the way for developing novel plant-based interventions for NDs . | Recent research has identified several bioactive compounds within F. | vulgare ethanol extracts (FVSE), including anethole, 2-propanone, 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-, and para-anisaldehyde diethyl acetal , which may influence neurotrophic pathways such as PI3K-AKT and Erk12 . | Some of these compounds are recognized for their anti-oxidative effects, while others are believed to have direct neurotrophic effects, providing a multifaceted approach to neuroprotection . | This study aims to investigate the neurotrophic effects of FVSE on primary hippocampal neurons, focusing on its role in promoting neuronal differentiation, neuritogenesis, and synaptogenesis. | Specifically, we hypothesize that FVSE enhances neurotrophic signaling pathways, thereby supporting neuronal growth and synaptic connectivity while protecting against neurodegenerative mechanisms. | Using a combination of in vitro, in vivo assays, and in silico analyses, we explore how FVSE modulates neurotrophic signaling pathways to enhance neuronal development and connectivity. | Notably, FVSE at concentrations ranging from 10 to 60 µgmL demonstrated neuroprotective effects by preventing cell death in a dose-dependent manner. | This analysis focused on the expression of key synaptic markers and NMDA receptor subunits to provide insights into FVSEs potential neuroprotective effects. | 2.8. Analysis of FVSE Bio-Active Compounds and Neuroprotective Targets Network The analysis of FVSE focused on identifying its bioactive compounds and their potential neuroprotective targets. | This significant overlap suggests that the bioactive compounds in FVSE may influence pathways essential for neuronal growth and differentiation. | Further analysis using protein-protein interaction (PPI) network mapping (Figure 9B,C) identified key hub proteins integral to neuroprotective mechanisms, indicating that FVSE compounds may interact with these critical proteins to exert neuroprotective effects. | Noteworthy genes, such as Bcl2, GSK3βser9, Trk-A, Trk-B, and BDNF, are emphasized for their roles in promoting neuronal survival and plasticity. | KEGG pathway analysis (Figure 9D-d) revealed significant involvement in pathways related to neurotrophic signaling, PI3K-AKT signaling, and Alzheimers disease, among others. | The enrichment of the neurotrophic signaling pathway is particularly notable, supporting the hypothesis that FVSE compounds may promote neuroprotection and enhance neuronal connectivity by modulating these critical pathways (Supplementary Figures S2S4). | These findings suggest that FVSE holds promise as a therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases, potentially offering a multifaceted approach to supporting neuronal health and neuroprotection. | These findings suggest that both anethole and FVSE have strong neurotrophic effects, effectively promoting neurite outgrowth and elongation, surpassing the performance of the positive controls. | Immunofluorescence Analysis of Neurotrophin Signaling Proteins To investigate the neuroprotective effects of FVSE ethanol extract and anethole, we conducted immunocytochemistry on primary cultured hippocampal neurons to evaluate the expression of Neurotrophin signaling proteins, including NGF, BDNF, Trk-A, Trk-B, and GSK3βser9 (Figure 11). | Recent studies support its neuroprotective effects, reinforcing its historical application for neuronal health . | However, its potential for neurotrophic effects, especially in promoting neuronal growth and maturation, has not been fully explored. | In this study, we investigated the neurotrophic potential of FVSE using dissociated hippocampal cultures as an in vitro model. | Our findings indicate that FVSE significantly enhances neuronal survival, axon-dendritic arborization, synaptogenesis, and modulates key signaling pathways associated with these morphological changes in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. | For instance, FVSE treatment significantly increased the expression of neurotrophic factors NGF and BDNF and their receptors Trk-A and Trk-B , as demonstrated by immunocytochemical analysis (Figure 11A). | These proteins are central to the Neurotrophin signaling pathway, highlighting FVSEs potential in enhancing neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity. | Quantification of fluorescence intensity (Figure 11B) further supports these findings, showing significant upregulation of these key neurotrophic markers. | Moreover, PTGS2 (COX-2), a known mediator of inflammation, was modulated by FVSE, highlighting its potential to reduce neuroinflammation and improve neuronal survival . | Together, these findings suggest that FVSE not only enhances synaptic plasticity but also modulates pathways implicated in neurodegeneration, thereby providing cognitive resilience and neuroprotection. | Although glial cells were not the primary focus of this study, the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties of FVSE suggest that its bioactive compounds may positively influence glial and immune cell functions . | Such studies could reveal whether FVSEs bioactive compounds enhance astrocytic neurotrophic support, regulate microglial inflammatory responses, or promote oligodendrocyte myelination, thereby expanding its therapeutic potential. | SV2 is involved in neurotransmitter release, while PSD95 clusters neurotransmitter receptors, suggesting that FVSE enhances both pre- and postsynaptic structures, strengthening the synaptic connections often compromised in NDs. GC-MS analysis identified key bioactive compounds in FVSE, including anethole, silane, and para-anisaldehyde diethyl acetal, which regulate signaling pathways related to neuroprotection, neurodevelopment, and neuroplasticity . | Anethole, in particular, is known for its 1:50 anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which could contribute to FVSEs neuroprotective effects . | The modulation of pathways involving PI3K , Trk-A , Trk-B , Bcl2, GSK3βser9 , and Erk12 underscores FVSEs potential role in promoting neuronal survival and function, especially in managing neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimers disease . | By modulating these pathways, FVSE may promote neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, and neurogenesis, offering therapeutic potential in managing Alzheimers disease . | Key kinases such as Trk-B, GSK3βser9, and Erk12 play crucial roles in neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function by influencing processes such as dendritic branching, axonal growth, and synaptic strength . | Likewise, FVSE modulates TP53 and PTGS2, which are associated with stress responses and neuro-inflammation, providing neuroprotective effects. | Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis highlighted key genes, including AKT1, TP53, Trk-B, and BDNF, which are essential for neuronal survival and plasticity . | BDNF, a well-known neurotrophic factor, supports synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions . | The protective effects of FVSE on neuronal survival are likely due to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of its bioactive compounds . | The following chemicals and reagents were used: trypsin inhibitor (Welgene, Gyeongsan, Gyeongsangbuk, Republic of Korea), Poly-D-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), boric acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, CAS 10043-35-3), Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS, Welgene, Gyeongsan, Gyeongsangbuk, Republic of Korea), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, CAS 67-68-5), and β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, CAS 60-24-2). | We used an extraction ratio of 1:50 with 95 ethanol, based on preliminary studies that indicated optimal extraction efficiency at this ratio for neuroprotective studies. | B27-supplemented serum-free neurobasal medium was used as the plating medium, which was combined with FVSE extract, control, or other compounds before seeding the cells. | Similarly, antibodies specific to neurotrophic signaling and synaptic function were included: BDNF (rabbit polyclonal, 1:100; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), NGF (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), Trk-A (rabbit polyclonal, 1:500; ABclonal, Wuhan, China), Trk-B (rabbit polyclonal, 1:500; ABclonal, Wuhan, China), and GSK3βser9 (1:500; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA). | A protease inhibitor cocktail was added to the lysis buffer, and the cell lysates were incubated on ice for 20 min. | 4.8. A In Silico Network Pharmacology 4.8.1. ADMET Analysis of GC-MSHPLC Compounds In a prior study, ethanol extracts of FVSE were analyzed using GC-MS and HPLC, identifying 40 compounds. | The ADMET properties (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) of these compounds were evaluated to assess their drug-like characteristics, bioavailability, and safety profiles. | Using in silico network pharmacology, the biological activities and potential molecular interactions of these compounds were explored to gain insights into their therapeutic potential. | The 2D structures of the identified compounds were sourced from the PubChem database (https:pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, accessed on 16 August 2024), and their pharmacokinetic properties, including ADMET characteristics, were analyzed using the Swiss ADME online tool (http:www.swissadme.ch, accessed on 16 August 2024). | To identify and analyze potential neuronal development-related targets, shared targets between four key bioactive compounds (anethole, 2-Propanone, 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-, silane, ethoxy(dimethylphenyl)-, and para-anisaldehyde diethyl acetal) and neuronal development were identified and visualized using a Venn diagram. | KEGG pathway enrichment highlighted the Neurotrophin signaling pathway, suggesting that FVSE compounds may influence genes within this pathway, which are associated with neuronal development and function. | vulgare seed extract (FVSE) promotes neuronal growth, enhances synaptic connections, and improves neuronal survival, all of which are crucial for maintaining cognitive health. | The bioactive compounds in FVSE, particularly anethole, positively influence key pathways involved in neuronal survival, neuroprotection, neurodevelopment, and neuroplasticity. | Notably, FVSEs effects are mediated through the modulation of neurotrophic factors such as BDNF and NGF, which activate downstream signaling pathways that regulate neuronal growth and resilience. | Our findings suggest that FVSE influences the Neurotrophin signaling pathway, particularly through Trk-A and Trk-B receptors, which are critical for neuronal survival and plasticity. | These insights underscore FVSEs potential as a complementary therapy for managing NDs. Future research, including network pharmacology, computational docking and simulation analyses, and animal studies, is necessary to confirm these findings and assess the clinical applicability of FVSE and its bioactive compounds. | The results of these future studies could significantly guide the development of FVSE and its bioactive compounds as potential therapeutic agents for ND treatment.",

This information demonstrates the bioactive potential of PF compounds and their role in the control and treatment of various human health problems. | Flavonoids and prenylated compounds in these plants are responsible for some health-promoting properties . | Flavonoids are phenolic compounds with a basic flavane structure of 15 carbon atoms (C6-C3-C6) consisting of two benzene rings (A and B) linked by a three-carbon pyran ring (C) (Figure 1a). | Prenylated flavonoids (PFs) belong to a unique category of prenylated phenolic compounds. | The majority of prenylated phenolic compounds have been recognized as flavonoids, stilbenoids, and xanthones. | However, a thorough analysis of the scientific literature reveals that there are still many unanswered questions about these fascinating bioactive compounds and new targets for their beneficial effects are constantly being discovered. | Although several reviews on prenylated phenolics can be found in the scientific literature , work still needs to focus on the intriguing bioactive properties of prenylated phenolic compounds from Fabaceae plants. | The PFs were classified into five bioactivities: anti-cancer, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, and anti-Alzheimers and neuroprotective activities. | In addition, 11 PF compounds showed more than one biological activity, as indicated in Table 1. | This review aims to present the latest scientific findings on the biological activities of PF compounds of Fabaceae plants and the associated health benefits supported by experimental evidence from the last decade. | When pathogens or other stressors attack the plant, these compounds, derived from L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine, produce a series of intricate enzymatic reactions, each catalyzed by a specific enzyme. | This review describes the biological activities of PFs in Fabaceae plants, including anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anti-Alzheimers activities, as well as their neuroprotective activities. | Most of the articles collected in these two databases focused on the PF compounds of the Fabaceae family (Figure 3a). | Several PF compounds were identified

5-O-methyl-2-methoxy-3-methylalpinumisoflavone stood out with a remarkable value of 0.98 μM against HL-60 cancer cells . | The unique structures of these compounds, including the alpinumisoflavone in the B-ring, significantly contribute to their cytotoxicity against cancer cells . | Licoflavonol compounds extracted from the medicinal plant G. | Additionally, 6,8-diprenyleriodictyol, a natural compound isolated from the plant Derris ferruginea, showed cytotoxicity against MRC-5 and KB cells, with IC50 values of 8.0 and 8.5 µM, respectively . | Two compounds, maackiafavanone and 5-hydroxysophoranone, were found to have a toxic effect on SK-MEL-5 and HeLa cells, with IC50 values of 7.7 and 12 µM, respectively. | Similar compounds, such as isomaackiafavanone A, isomaackiafavanone B, and abyssinone V, displayed lower cytotoxicity towards these cells with IC50 values in the 1636 µM range. | These compounds exhibited stronger toxicity to H4IIE hepatoma cells than monoprenyl-substituted flavonoids, reaching EC50 values of 14.7, 5.25, and 8.5 µM, respectively. | The main difference between these compounds is that the 2-hydroxy-3-methyl-3-butanyl group in sanjuanolide was replaced by 2,3-dihydroxy-3-methyl-3-butenyl group in sanjoseolide. | Chalcone compounds (artonin ZA-1, artonin ZA-2, renifolin C, 2,4-hydroxy-3,4-dimethoxychalcone, 2,3-hydroxy-4,4-dimethoxychalcone, and renifolins DH) obtained from D. | In addition, the compounds kanzonol C and hedysarumine F from Hedysarum gmelinii showed remarkable cytotoxicity against A549

systems including competitive ligand-binding assays, in vitro cell assays, and in vivo animal models . | The outcome indicated that these compounds closely bind with the estrogen receptor, with EC50 values of 5 105 M and 5 106 M, respectively. | (2018) found that Phaseolus vulgaris extract and its flavonoid contents have an inhibitory effect on lymphoma in mice both in vivo and in vitro . | vulgaris showed considerable anti-cancer properties and suppressed the development of human MCF-7, while flavonoids also showed an inhibitory effect against human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-3) cells during in vivo model studies. | Some compounds, such as flemiphilippinone C from F. | In summary, the research highlights the diverse sources of natural compounds with potential anti-cancer properties and the critical importance of understanding the structureactivity relationships of these compounds for the development of effective cancer treatments. | Further studies and clinical trials are essential to harness these natural compounds for cancer treatment. | These and other PF compounds with anti-cancer activity of the Fabaceae family are listed in Table 2. | The molecular diversity of phytochemicals from Fabaceae extracts and isolated compounds, enhanced by germination and fungal attacks, presents a promising avenue for combating antibiotic resistance. | The relationship between phytochemical composition and the antibacterial properties of extracts and isolated compounds has been extensively investigated, with extracts rich in prenylated isoflavonoids and stilbenoids showing potent antibacterial activity against various bacteria andor fungi . | The compounds known as iconisoflavan and iconisoflaven, as well as four other PFs, have been found in the roots of Glycyrrhiza iconica; using a microdilution method, these compounds were tested for their antimicrobial properties against five bacteria and one yeast line. | Of these, iconisoflavan, (3S)-licoricidin, licorisoflavan A, and topazolin displayed significant activity against Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 13311, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC, a measure of the effectiveness of an antimicrobial in inhibiting the growth of a microorganism) ranging from 2 to 8 μg mL1 . | Of the compounds tested, two new prenylated dihydrochalcones (2,4,5,6-tetrahydroxy-4-methoxy-3,3-diprenyldihydrochalcone,2,4,4,6-tetrahydroxy-3,3-diprenyldihydrochalcone and lupinalbin A) exhibited robust activity against the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis, with MIC values ranging from 3.1 μM to 8.9 μM, as did the crude leaf extract (MIC of 3.0 μg mL1). | However, neither crude extracts nor isolated compounds show activity against Escherichia coli . | The results are significant, revealing the most effective compounds against MRSA including the di-prenylated flavonoids glabrol and 6,8-diprenylgenistein, and the mono-prenylated 4-O-methyl glabridin, all with MIC values 10 μg mL1 (30 μM). | The most important finding about the PF compounds tested was the wide range of MIC values found, which ranged from 1 to 600 μg mL1. | Antimicrobial assays have shown that these compounds are effective against Streptococcus mutans, Bacillus cereus, and oxacillin-sensitive (OSSA) and -resistant (ORSA) S. | None of these three compounds was found to have antimicrobial activity against Salmonella enterica, E. | At the same time, monoprenylated compound 5-deoxy-3-prenylbiochanin A showed no activity against MRSA . | The PF compounds (E)-5-hydroxytephrostachin, terpurlepflavone, and tachrosin, extracted from the stem of the commonly used medicinal plant Tephrosia purpurea subsp. | Five new compounds, namely rhodimer, rhodiflavan A, rhodiflavan B, rhodiflavan C, and rhodacarpin, were isolated from the roots of Tephrosia rhodesica. | Among these compounds, rhodimer was an atypical flavanone-flavan dimer, while rhodiflavan C possessed a five-membered A-ring, a unique feature for this genus. | Various compounds were extracted from D. | caudatum, including seven new PFs and nineteen known compounds, and subsequently tested for their ability to inhibit the growth of film-forming yeast Zygosaccharomyces rouxii F51. | Some of the tested compounds exhibited inhibitory effects, and their MIC values ranged from 7.8 to 62.5 μg mL1. | Of them, 2,2-dimethylpyran-(5,6:7,8)-5,2-dihydroxy-4-methoxy-(2R,3R)-dihydroflavonol exhibited pronounced inhibitory activity, with an MIC value of 7.8 μg mL1 . | The plant Glycyrrhiza inflata produces two PF compounds, 2-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)-3,5,4-trihydroxy-bibenzyl and (2S)-6--3,4,5,7-tetrahydroxy-dihydroflavanone, as well as some dihydroflavanones, which have been shown to inhibit the growth of both Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. | The compound 2-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)-3,5,4-trihydroxy-bibenzyl possessed moderate antibacterial activity against S. | The compounds isolated from these plants exhibited significant antibacterial and antifungal properties against specific bacteria and fungi, especially certain compounds that displayed effective anti-MRSA properties, indicating the potential for new anti-MRSA therapeutics. | Table 3 gives an overview of the antimicrobial active PF compounds of the Fabaceae family. | In this context, several PF compounds (sophoraflavanone G, kurarinone, kuraridin, 5-methyisophoraflavanone B, echinoisoflavanone, echinoisosophoranone, isosophoranone, sanggenon B, and sanggenon D) and derivatives have been isolated from Fabaceae plants, and their anti-inflammatory potential has been evaluated . | Research on the PF compound sophoraflavanone G (SG) has provided unique insights into its mechanism of action. | The efficacy of SG was observed by attenuating the expression of phosphorylated Janus kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAKSTAT). | The effects of several PF compounds (hedysarumines B, E, and G, and paratocarpins A-C, E, and F) on NO production in murine BV-2 microglial cells were investigated to determine their anti-inflammatory effects. | The results revealed that hedysarumines B and G and paratocarpin F had significant inhibitory effects on NO production, with IC50 values of 5.12, 3.25, and 8.48 μM, respectively, which were comparable to those of dexamethasone, which was used as a positive control (9.47 μM). | This suggests that these PF compounds could be as effective as dexamethasone, a commonly used anti-inflammatory drug. | These chalcones have a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on LPS-activated microglia nitric oxide (NO) generation and PGE2. | They also inhibited the degradation of inhibitor-κBα (I-κBα) and reduced the amount of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) in LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglia. | In addition, the cytokinechemokine inhibitory effect of leachianone A was comparable to that of the commercial product betamethasone. | Both compounds reduced IL-1β mRNA and IL-6 mRNA levels in RAW264.7 cells stimulated with LPS and tumor necrosis factor-α. | These compounds have been shown to inhibit the production of inflammatory mediators such as ROS, interleukins, TNF-α, NF-kB, and NO by targeting key inflammatory signaling pathways. | Overall, the results emphasize the potential of PF compounds and their derivatives as natural candidates for treating inflammatory diseases. | Table 4 summarizes the anti-inflammatory PF compounds from the Fabaceae family. | Hirtacoumaroflavonoside acted as a non-competitive α-glucosidase inhibitor, with an IC50 of 22 μM . | Hirtaflavonoside B showed α-glucosidase inhibitory activity, with an IC50 value of 71 μM but with a mixed non-competitive inhibitory pattern . | Morusinol and dioxycudraflavone A also exhibited α-glucosidase inhibitory activities, with IC50 values of 23.2 and 25.27 μM, respectively . | corylifolia, showed a remarkable inhibitory effect on α-glucosidase, with IC50 values of 53.1 μM and 90.3 μM, respectively, when compared to the positive control acarbose (IC50 of 214.5 μM) . | The inhibitory activity is more potent in prenylated isoflavonoids with a linear prenyl group than for the cyclized ones . | Moreover, adding the hydroxyl group to the prenyl group could significantly increase the inhibitory effect, while adding the OCH3 group decreases the inhibitory effect. | Prenylation of flavonoids increases their potency in inhibiting α-glucosidase, with prenylated isoflavonoids with a linear prenyl group showing a stronger inhibitory activity. | The addition of a hydroxyl group to the prenyl group can significantly increase the inhibitory effect, while adding an OCH3 group reduces the inhibitory effect. | Several compounds isolated from P. | This research provides valuable insight into the potential use of these compounds in the treatment of postprandial hyperglycemia and the modulation of PPAR-γ activity for controlling glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism. | Among their numerous biological activities, they have been reported to act at the central nervous system (CNS) level by exhibiting neuroprotective activity through various mechanisms of action. | Knowledge about the neuroprotective effects of natural products rich in phytochemicals, such as PFs, in preventing brain diseases, especially NDs, is rapidly expanding. | However, more preclinical and clinical studies are still needed to fully understand the neuroprotective effects of PFs, including the prenylated compounds found in plants from the Fabaceae family. | In vivo evaluation of the neuroprotective activity of sophocarpine from Sophora genus revealed significant recovery rates from transient focal cerebral ischemia in sophocarpine-treated animals (5, 10, or 20 mgkg) . | glabra, a phenolic compound 2,2,4-trihydroxychalcone (TDC) has been isolated and has shown neuroprotective effects both in vitro and in vivo through decreasing BACE1 levels without affecting α- or γ-secretase levels . | (2017) carried out a preliminary toxicological assessment with (-)-(2S)-5,7, 2,4-tetrahydroxy-5-(1,1-dimethylallyl)-8-prenylflavanone compounds from the roots of Dalea species in mice, which suggested an acceptable level of safety, encouraging future in vivo assays to validate neuroprotective activity, as well as to test its bioavailability, metabolic stability, safety, efficacy, and effective dose . | ChEs inhibitors may be more effective in the prevention and treatment of AD. | elegans and Dalea pazensis are important sources of natural compounds of the prenylated flavanone type, such as: ()-(2S)-2,4-dihydroxy-5-(1,1-dimethylallyl)-8-prenylpinocembrin (8PP), ()-(2S)-8-prenylpinocembrin (glabranin), ()-(2S)-4-hydroxy-2-methoxy-5-(1,1-dimethylallyl)-8-prenylpinocembrin (Me8PP), ()-(2S)-3,4-dihydroxy-6,2-diprenylpinocembrin (pazentin A), and (2S)-()-4-hydroxy-2-methoxy-5-(1,1-dimethylallyl)-6-prenylpinocembrin (pazentin B) . | In an in vitro model of a culture of primary cerebellar granule neurons (CGN), these natural prenylated flavonones from the Dalea species were investigated for their neuroprotective potential. | The compounds 8PP and glabranin showed neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress-induced death in both models: CGNs and (NGF)-differentiated PC12 cells. | In addition, in silico studies were performed, and several putative targets in NDs were identified for compounds 8 PP and glabranin. | Prenylated compounds from Psoralea fructus, bavachalcone, and bavachin showed potent inhibition of NO production similar to curcumin. | These PFs demonstrated dose-dependent inhibitory effects, with IC50 values of 6.10 and 7.71 μM, respectively . | The PF compounds with the strongest anti-Alzheimers and neuroprotective activity are shown in Figure 8. | Based on the literature, flavonoids, especially prenylated compounds from the Fabaceae family, which are rich in phytochemicals, have shown promising neuroprotective effects in the prevention and treatment of NDs. These compounds have demonstrated neuroprotective effects through different mechanisms of action, such as regulating heme oxygenase-1 gene expression, activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway, and influencing gene expression related to neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. | Specific compounds such as glyceollins from soybeans and prenylated flavanones from Dalea species have been reported to exhibit neuroprotective effects in in vitro models, which represents a potential for the development of future strategies for the treatment of NDs. Additionally, prenylated compounds from P. | These findings highlight the potential of flavonoids and prenylated compounds as promising candidates for the development of effective therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. | However, further preclinical and clinical studies are needed to understand and fully exploit the neuroprotective effects of these compounds. | Table 6 summarizes the anti-Alzheimers and neuroprotective activities of PFs from the Fabaceae family. | Conclusions The findings described in this review suggest the emerging therapeutic potential of prenylated flavonoid compounds of the Fabaceae plants to protect against diseases, which is beneficial for human health. | However, the scarcity of clinical trials with functional evidence makes it necessary to develop techniques and therapeutic doses to administer these compounds, since they can be modified when coming into contact with in vivo models. | For example, isobavachalcone and sophoraflavanone G could be good candidates for testing in animal models since they have shown the following biological activities: anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, anti-cancer, anti-Alzheimer, and neuroprotective activities. | It is also crucial to emphasize the need for further research to evaluate the capacity of PFs from Fabaceae species, as very few compounds have been tested in animal models to verify in vitro results.",

M3G Mediates Antioxidative Effects Through Nrf2HO-1 Signaling Nrf2HO-1 signaling is the primary regulator of essential cytoprotective responses and activates the expression of various neuroprotective genes that encode antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and detoxifying proteins . | To determine whether Nrf2HO-1 signaling is involved in M3G-mediated antioxidative effects, the Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 was used. | This inhibitory action of ML385 on the antioxidative potential of M3G suggests that M3G mediates its antioxidative effects via the Nrf2HO-1 signaling pathway. | The results revealed that the presence of the Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 reversed the M3G-mediated anti-apoptotic effects, as the relative cell count of live cells was significantly reduced and that of dead cells was significantly increased in the presence of ML385, thus diminishing the M3Gs cytoprotective properties (Figure 10ae). | Dietary anthocyanins have been proactively discussed by various researchers in recent years because of their well-established neuroprotective effects on the central nervous system . | Previously, various MPTP in vivo mouse models were used to mimic PD-related pathophysiology; therefore, this study aimed to develop an in vitro humanized system that correlates the combined effects of α-syn and MPTP and examines the neuroprotective effects of M3G on α-syn- and MPTP-induced cytotoxicity, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation. | Understanding this dual activation is crucial, as it highlights the complexity of the apoptotic response in neuroinflammatory conditions and suggests that targeting both pathways may be necessary for effective neuroprotection. | The Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 has been reported to inhibit Nrf2 DNA binding, relative expression, and downstream target genes . | When the Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 was co-treated in the α-syn, MPTP, and M3G co-treatment group, the oxidative stress was found to be significantly upregulated, which was reduced in the treatment group without ML385. | These results confirmed that the cytoprotective (antioxidative and anti-apoptotic) properties of M3G in the α-syn and MPTP co-treated HMC3 cells are mediated through Nrf2HO-1 signaling, which is consistent with the previously reported literature regarding the Nrf2HO-1-mediated antioxidative properties of M3G and the inhibitory action of ML385 . | However, both in vitro and in vivo studies should be conducted to elucidate the mechanism underlying the M3G-mediated neuroprotective properties in a PD model. | These factors need to be explored thoroughly in future studies to identify the inter-relationships among different neurodegenerative disorders and to ensure that a novel compound effective against all these inter-related pathologies can be identified. | MPTP hydrochloride (HY-15608) and Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 (HY-100523) were obtained from MedChemExpress LLC (Princeton, NJ, USA). | 4.5. 2,7-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein Diacetate (DCFH-DAH2DCFDA) Assay DCFH-DA is a membrane-permeable compound that can be enzymatically converted to 2,7-dichlorofluorescein (DCF), a highly fluorescent compound, in the presence of ROS. | This experiment was repeated in the presence of an Nrf2 inhibitor (ML385; 5 μM). | Similarly, while experimenting with the Nrf2 inhibitor, HMC3 cells were again co-treated with α-syn (8 μgmL) and MPTP (2 mM) in the presence or absence of M3G (50 μM), withwithout the presence of the Nrf2 inhibitor (ML385; 5 μM). | To analyze protein expression, a protein lysis buffer (iNtRON Biotechnology Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea) containing protease and phosphate inhibitors was used to harvest the total protein content from HMC3 cells. | M3G reduced the anti-apoptotic and antioxidant properties in the presence of the Nrf2 inhibitor ML385, revealing the role of Nrf2HO-1 signaling in the antioxidative and anti-apoptotic actions of M3G.",

In-Solution Study on the Host-Guest Interaction of the CARAMEB Inclusion Complex The poor water solubility of a new pharmacological compound represents a barrier to its introduction into the market . | Furthermore, in the range from 1500 to 400 cm1, we find the fingerprint region for the identification of CA and most organic compounds. | The postulated complexation of CA with RAMEB was also demonstrated via NMR spectroscopy using rotating frame Overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY) experiments, where if two protons from different compounds are in the spatial vicinity within 35 Å, an ROE cross-peak is observed in the 2D ROESY spectrum (Figure 12 and Figure S4). | First, cell viability was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of the compounds upon 48 h of incubation (Figure S5A). | The results showed that all concentrations of CA, CARAMEB complex, and RAMEB did not show cytotoxicity on SH-SY5Y cells, confirming their suitability for neuroprotective studies (Figure S5A). | To assess the protective potential of the CARAMEB complex over CA and RAMEB alone, cells were exposed for 6 h to the compounds, and viability was evaluated under 48 h treatment with 2 mM 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP), a neurotoxin used in vitro to mimic PD (Figure 13A). | At the same concentrations, CA and RAMEB alone did not have any effect on MPP-injured SH-SY5Y cells, thus supporting the efficiency of the RAMEB complex system for the delivery and the neuroprotective function of CA (Figure 13C and Figure S5B). | For the neuroprotective studies, the cells were pretreated with the compounds for 6 h and then exposed to 2 mM MPP (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, D048) for 48 h. | Finally, the potential neuroprotective effect of CARAMEB was tested in SH-SY5Y cells, widely used as a model for neurodegenerative studies, including PD.",

Effect of GM1 on the Survival Rate of Propofol-Administered PC12 Cells To further determine the mechanism of GM1s neuroprotective effects, PC12 cell lines were used for in vitro experiments. | Overall, these findings suggested that the PI3KAKTNF-κB signaling cascade might be involved in GM1-mediated neuroprotection against propofol-induced neurotoxicity. | Phosphorylated NF-κB (p-p65) serves as a critical activator of downstream inflammatory signals. | Currently, GM1 is widely used as a neuroprotective agent in various CNS diseases such as Parkinsons disease (PD), Alzheimers disease (AD), and strokes . | These findings suggest a potential link between the neuroprotective impact of GM1 and PI3KAKT pathway signaling. | To further clarify the potential mechanism of GM1, LY294002 (a specific PI3K inhibitor) was used in this study. | Nonetheless, the process of translating these findings from animal models into human medical clinical practice is currently hindered by numerous factors and remains profoundly uncertain, as follows, (1) whether our results are applicable to different development stages or other animals and (2) whether the variance in the exposure time of propofol has an influence on the neuroprotective effect of GM1 as well as (3) the difficulty in conducting clinical studies on the neuroprotective effects of GM1. | The limitations of this study included its small sample size and exclusive focus on rats, necessitating future research with larger sample sizes and the inclusion of other animal species to comprehensively assess the neuroprotective effects of GM1. | In future research, it will be essential to conduct additional types of behavioral experiments and long-term observations to evaluate the impact of GM1 on cognitive function and its neuroprotective effects against propofol-induced developmental neurotoxicity. | Furthermore, future research should explore the effects of GM1 on other pathways through the PI3KAKTNF-κB pathway (such as mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress) to better clarify the neuroprotective mechanisms of GM1. | Our findings demonstrated that GM1 exerted a neuroprotective effect and ameliorated propofol-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction via the modulation of the PI3KAKTNF-κB signaling cascade.",

      "text_block": "In the central nervous system, interactions among neurons and glial cells are known to modulate neurotransmission, energy metabolism, extracellular ion homeostasis, and neuroprotection. | In astrocytic cell lines and primary astrocytes, bradykinin and several other ligands acting on Gq-coupled receptors stimulated Ca2 mobilization, which subsequently led to the release of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). | Because astrocytes are also known to release growth factors and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as glia-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and IL-10 , activation of astrocytic Gq-coupled receptors may regulate functions other than those associated with driving inflammation. | Hence, we first explored if other members of the IL-6 family, including cardiotrophin 1 (CT-1), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), LIF, and oncostatin M (OSM), can also be induced by Gq proteins. | Besides IL-6, constitutively active QL mutants of Gαq members (Gαq, Gα11, and Gα16) potently stimulated the production of LIF but not ciliary neurotrophic factor, cardiotrophin 1, or oncostatin M (Supplementary Figure S1A). | Using a panel of specific protein kinase inhibitors, B2R-mediated LIF secretion in U87-MG cells was found to require ERK (PD98059), p38 MAPK (SB203580), and Src kinase (SU6656) (Figure 3F); Src is known to be activated by B2R in rat chromaffin medullary cells . | Partial inhibition of LIF secretion was observed with the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor Go6976 (Figure 3F), indicating the potential involvement of isozymes other than PKCα and PKCβ1. | Likewise, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 partially inhibited bradykinin-induced LIF secretion as compared with the control group. | To test this hypothesis, U87-MG cells were incubated in the absence or presence of agonists of Gq-coupled receptors (bombesin, bradykinin, or histamine) for 24 h without serum, the conditioned media were then collected and applied to SK-N-SH neuroblastomas and SK-N-MC neuroepitheliomas for 15 min, and stimulatory phosphorylations of ERK as well as signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in the recipient cells were assessed by Western blotting (Figure 4A). | Moreover, the neuroprotective effect of LIF against brain injuries is obtained through the stimulation of the astrocytes that prevent secondary neurogenerative responses . | However, bradykinin may induce anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in the brain, mediated by glial cells, as the activation of B2R in astrocytes has been demonstrated to produce prostaglandin E2, with the consequential increase in intracellular cAMP leading to decrease levels of TNF-α and IL-1β . | Additionally, experimental cells (80100 confluence) that had been serum-starved with MEM without FBS in 12-well plates were pretreated with various inhibitors (of specific targets) 30 min prior to bradykinin stimulation, as follows: 10 μM of Go6976 (protein kinase C); 10 μM of SB203580 (p38 MAPK); 10 μM of SU6656 (Src kinases); 10 μM of SP600125 (JNK); 10 μM of PD98059 (ERK); and 5 μM of HOE-140 (bradykinin B2 receptor). | Alternatively, cells subjected to pretreatment with the same series of specific inhibitors were stimulated with bradykinin for 24 h, followed by detection of induced LIF production with ELISA assays.",

Inhibitory Activity of Protein Hydrolysates on BACE1 The BACE1 inhibitory potential of various protein hydrolysates was assessed through the BACE1 FRET assay. | Table 2 shows that all hydrolysates derived from papain and bromelain exhibited inhibitory activity against BACE1 activity, except for thermolysin-derived hydrolysates (C-The, W-The, and C-The). | The highest inhibitory rate was observed for G-Bro, with an IC50 value of 0.408 mgmL, followed sequentially by W-Bro, G-Pap, W-Pap, and C-Bro. | Hydrolysates such as C-The, W-The, and C-The demonstrated negligible inhibitory activity. | Presently, several small-molecule BACE1 inhibitors have been identified, including AZD3293, E2609, CNP520, JNJ-54861911, and MK-8931. | Nonetheless, only limited studies have evaluated protein hydrolysates as BACE1 inhibitors. | Although the inhibitory activities of individual peptides were not evaluated in this study, it is anticipated that peptide purification could yield sequences with enhanced BACE1 inhibition. | Hydrolysates generated by bromelain and papain displayed moderate to high inhibitory activity, whereas thermolysin-generated hydrolysates exhibited minimal inhibition. | Gliadin-derived hydrolysates, particularly G-Bro, were identified as having the highest inhibitory activity, while casein-derived hydrolysates demonstrated relatively lower efficacy. | The observed variations in inhibitory efficacy may arise from enzyme-specific cleavage patterns and differences in protein sequences, resulting in peptides with varied inhibitory potencies . | Research on BACE1 peptide inhibitors has indicated that no single amino acid residue universally contributes to inhibition, with peptide size and amino acid positioning playing crucial roles in potency . | These insights emphasize the importance of carefully selecting starting materials and hydrolysis enzymes to yield bioactive peptides with optimized inhibitory effects. | 2.3. Effect of G-Bro on the Viability of N2aPSAPP Cells To assess the BACE1 inhibitory potential of G-Bro in a neuroblastoma cell model, a murine neuroblastoma cell line (N2aPSAPP), which stably overexpresses the Swedish mutant form of human APP (APPswe, K595NM596L) and PS2 mutation, was utilized. | Numerous natural compounds have demonstrated potential in attenuating BACE1 protein expression, which holds therapeutic promise for AD. | The mechanisms underlying this inhibitory effect have been attributed to proline-rich polypeptides in these hydrolysates . | By introducing steric hindrance and disrupting hydrogen bonding patterns essential for Aβ aggregation, glutamine residues may contribute to the overall inhibitory effect of these peptides on Aβ assembly . | The unique combination of amino acid sequences in these peptides may facilitate the formation of specific secondary structures that do not support the aggregation process, thus contributing to their overall inhibitory effects on Aβ assembly . | 3.4. BACE1 Activity Assay The inhibitory activity of gliadin hydrolysates against BACE1 was evaluated using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based BACE1 assay. | Among tested hydrolysates, G-Bro showed superior BACE1 inhibitory activity and effectively reduced extracellular levels of soluble APP (sAPP) while preventing Aβ aggregation. | The inhibitory effect of G-Bro on Aβ formation and aggregation may be attributed to a combination of its distinct peptide characteristics.",

compared to non-innervated muscle bundles cultured with or without neurotrophic factors. | Non-innervated muscle bundles also experienced a decline in rise and fall times as the culture progressed, whereas innervated muscle bundles and non-innervated muscle bundles with neurotrophic factors maintained more consistent rise and fall times. | Interestingly, neurotrophic factors alone, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), have also been shown to rescue denervation-induced muscle atrophy8, 9, demonstrating the functional importance of neuron-associated paracrine signaling on muscle growth. | To determine any impacts of neurotrophic factors on muscle differentiation, we also cultured non-innervated muscle bundles with or without neurotrophic factors. | Then, a small molecule cocktail that included CHIR99021, DMH1, and SB431542 was incorporated into the differentiation media formulation described in the previous section without ACA to generate OLIG2-positive motor neuron progenitors. | Subsequent enrichment of the progenitors into functional motor neurons (90) occurred over another 16 days with the use of a Notch inhibitor (compound E) and activation of Hedgehog signaling (purmorphamine)22, 24. | Following addition of the mixture into the device, the fibrin hydrogel was allowed to solidify at 37 C for 30 minutes, and growth media with the addition of 1.5 mgmL ACA and 10 ngmL of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and glial cell derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) were added to submerge bundles. | Media was exchanged after 2 days, and after 4 days in growth media with ACA and neurotrophic factors, media was switched to differentiation medium with ACA and neurotrophic factors and cultured on a rocker, as described above. | Media was then exchanged every other day, with neurotrophic factors removed after one week of differentiation. | Select muscle bundles without motor neurons were also cultured in media with neurotrophic factors for the same time period as those with motor neurons. | Samples were then immersed in optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetek 4583) in 25 20 5 mm cryomolds and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. | Innervated muscle bundles were also cultured with neurotrophic factors BDNF, CNTF, and GDNF to support motor neuron viability for the first week of culture. | For each batch of engineered tissues, we then normalized all force measurements to the average value for non-innervated muscle bundles without neurotrophic factors to account for variability in the primary harvest of chick myoblasts. | The presence of neurotrophic factors had no impact on the normalized magnitude of contraction force (Figure 4B, C). | Innervation and neurotrophic factors also impacted the dynamics of twitch contractions. | In non-innervated muscle bundles without neurotrophic factors, the rise time (Figure 4E) and fall time (Figure 4F) decreased close to significantly and significantly, respectively, from one to two weeks of differentiation, which is consistent with a loss of slow fibers andor gain of fast fibers. | In contrast, bundles cultured with neurotrophic factors, with or without motor neurons, maintained more consistent rise and fall times from one to two weeks of differentiation (Figure 4 E,F), possibly indicating less remodeling towards a fast, glycolytic phenotype. | At the one-week timepoint, non-innervated muscle bundles without neurotrophic factors expressed higher levels of the fast twitch gene myosin heavy chain (MYH1A) compared to muscle bundles with neurotrophic factors and motor neurons (Figure 5A). | Slow myosin light chain 3 (MYL3) was also downregulated in non-innervated bundles with neurotrophic factors after one week compared to the other two conditions (Figure 5A). | Non-innervated muscle bundles with neurotrophic factors expressed MB to an intermediate level (Figure 5B). | MYL3 expression similarly increased stepwise from non-innervated bundles, to non-innervated bundles with neurotrophic factors, to innervated bundles (Figure 5B). | A-FTM, encoding alpha-tropomyosin, a gene associated with fast twitch fibers32, was also downregulated in non-innervated bundles cultured with neurotrophic factors compared to the other two conditions (Figure 5B). | Neurotrophic factors alone also induce similar effects on gene expression, but to a lesser extent than the presence of both neurotrophic factors and motor neurons. | Muscle bundles without neurotrophic factors or motor neurons experienced a significant decline in rise and fall time from one to two weeks, consistent with a transition from slow to fast fibers. | By contrast, innervated muscle bundles and muscle bundles with neurotrophic factors maintained a more constant rise and fall time, suggesting that more slow fibers were maintained. | Paracrine crosstalk between motor neurons and skeletal muscle involves a complex mixture of neurotrophic factors and other myokines not investigated here51, 52, which may further explain the higher impact of motor neuron co-culture compared to neurotrophic factors alone.",

Once extracted, isolated, structurally identified, and assessed in vitro and in silico, these molecules performed as effective vasorelaxant agents capable of blocking CaV1.2 channels, thus representing valuable compounds deserving pharmaceutical andor nutraceutical exploitation as novel weapons in the cardiovascular arsenal. | Results 2.1. Citrus Extracts Display Vasorelaxant Activity A preliminary series of experiments was performed to assess whether the citrus extracts, namely, the ethanolic extract and the subsequent n-hexane and dichloromethane phases, contained compounds capable of inducing in vitro vasorelaxation. | In rings stimulated by 60 mM KCl, which causes membrane depolarization and CaV1.2 channel opening, all the compounds assessed caused concentration-dependent relaxation with pIC50 values (estimated for tangeretin and sinensetin) of 4.91 0.35 (scutellarein TME, n 5), 4.40 0.28 (tangeretin, n 5), 4.39 0.11 (nobiletin, n 5), and 4.23 0.26 (sinensetin, n 5) (Figure 5). | All the compounds assessed in endothelium-denuded preparations caused concentration-dependent relaxation of the α1 adrenergic receptor agonist phenylephrine-induced contraction. | None of the pure compounds assessed affected the τ of activation. | As shown in Figure 7, the representative docking poses for the most active compounds, i.e., scutellarein TME and tangeretin, selected based on the most favorable docking score values, were very similar: in both cases, the p-methoxy-phenyl ring was sandwiched between Trp1447 and Tyr1489 and engaged a π-π stacking with the latter. | This difference could explain the lower activity of these compounds compared with their monomethylated counterparts. | To get an insight into the binding modes of the compounds investigated, a docking study was carried out using a homology model of the rat CaV1.2 channel. | In fact, the same arrangement was precluded for the less active dimethoxylate compounds sinensetin and nobiletin due to steric hindrance. | The chemicals used in the biological assays included collagenase (type XI), trypsin inhibitor, bovine serum albumin, TEA chloride, phenylephrine, acetylcholine, nifedipine (Sigma Chimica, Milan, Italy), tangeretin and scutellarein TME (Extrasynthese; Genay Cedex, France), nobiletin and sinensetin (DBA, Segrate, Milan, Italy), and sodium nitroprusside (Riedel-De Haen AG, Seelze Hannover, Germany). | Nifedipine, directly dissolved in ethanol, and the analyzed compounds, directly dissolved in DMSO, were diluted at least 1000 times before use. | Extracts and pure compounds were assessed on rings pre-contracted by either 25 mM or 60 mM KCl and by 0.30.6 µM phenylephrine, respectively. | 4.3.3. Cell Isolation Procedure for Patch-Clamp Experiments Smooth muscle cells were freshly isolated from the tail main artery, at 37 C, using collagenase (type XI, 1.2 mgmL) treatment in the presence of bovine serum albumin (1 mgmL) and trypsin inhibitor (1 mgmL) in 2 mL of 0.1 mM Ca2 external solution containing 20 mM taurine. | 4.6. Multivariate Curve Resolution (MCR) To identify the compounds in the extraction procedure, the raw 1H-NMR spectra of the four standard compounds and fraction M3 (all samples in triplicate) were exported and converted into human-readable files (.csv), ready for direct import into MATLAB R2023a (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). | Molecular modeling studies provided a structural basis to rationalize the in vitro inhibitory effect of the four isolated Citrus peel PMFs on IBa1.2.

see Scheme 1) was extensively studied in various assays . | It exhibited a favorable safety profile and potent neuroprotective effects, outperforming reference compounds such as indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), melatonin, and rasagiline, as well as a prominent antioxidant capacity suppressing lipid peroxidation and deoxyribose degradation, with a higher potency than melatonin and Trolox . | Rivastigmine (marketed under different brand names including Exelon, Rivastach Patch, Prometax, and SDZ ENA 713) is a reversible inhibitor of both the acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase enzymes and is highly effective in the treatment of cognitive decline and Alzheimers disease across its mild and moderate stages, as well as in the treatment of various types of dementia including dementia associated with Parkinsons disease . | Step-through inhibitory avoidance and the Barnes maze were the behavioral methods used to evaluate the changes in learning and memory induced by scopolamine and the capability of 5MeO to counteract them. | Step-through inhibitory avoidance is one of the most broadly used behavioral methods to study learning and memory. | The step-through inhibitory avoidance task is a complex task with an emotional and spatial memory component to it and is very much dependent on the activation of the cholinergic system through the binding of acetylcholine released from cholinergic neurons originating in the basal forebrain to muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the hippocampus . | The above results are very much consistent with the previous results of ours in in vitro systems, namely, the neuroprotective effects of 5MeO against H2O2-induced oxidative stress in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and against Fe(II)-induced lipid peroxidation. | Curiously, although, in our previous studies on the scavenging activity of the superoxide anion (O2), 5MeO showed the best results from a series of similar compounds, it did not show convincing effects in vivo, failing to restore the scopolamine-decreased SOD activity in the cortex and hippocampus (SOD is known to facilitate the transition of O2 into O2 and H2O2 , a discrepancy that could be explained with a possible direct chelating or modifying effect in the solution related to the chemical structure of 5MeO against a more complex influence of the compound on the protein structure of SOD. | The antioxidant capability of 5MeO is further confirmed in assays of iron-induced oxidative damage on deoxyribose where the compound suppressed deoxyribose degradation and in a model of 6-hydroxydopamine-induced oxidative stress in isolated brain synaptosomes where it demonstrated significant neuroprotection . | Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an important neurotrophin, which in addition to neuron-supporting functions such as involvement in neuronal survival and growth and differentiation , has a key role in synaptic plasticity and, thus, in learning and memory . | Previously explored for Parkinsons disease in in vitro model systems, 5MeO demonstrated potent neuroprotective effects, strong antioxidant properties, and significant inhibition of MAO-B, a key enzyme implicated in both Parkinsons and Alzheimers disease. | Materials and Methods 5.1. Synthesis The synthesis, the structural data (IR, 1H, 13C NMR, mass spectroscopy), and the crystal structure of the target compound have been published elsewhere . | On the 11th day of treatment, behavioral tests such as step-through inhibitory avoidance and the Barnes maze tasks were performed, and on the 12th day after the start of the treatment, the rats were euthanized under CO2 inhalation and sacrificed for biochemical studies (Scheme 2). | Blood was used for assessment of parameters of toxicity such as alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate transferase (ASAT) activities, creatinine, and urea levels, as well as total protein, albumin, and globulin levels, and brains (cortex and hippocampus, separately) were used for assessment of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, acetylcholine (ACh) levels, and lipid peroxidation levels (LPO) as judged by the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, catalase activity, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. | 5.4.

      "text_block": "This study examines the neuroprotective and antioxidant effects of walnut oil (WO), extracted from Juglans regia L., in an in vitro PD model using the neurotoxin rotenone (ROT). | WO, rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including linoleic acid (LA) and α-linolenic acid (ALA), together with minor bioactive components, is known for its neuroprotective properties. | Among these, natural antioxidant compounds have gained attention for their potential benefits. | In this regard, WO is of particular interest, as it is well known for being rich in natural antioxidant compounds due to its high percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), contributing to approximately 70 of the percentage (ww) of the entire oil composition, together with the presence of micro-components such as tocopherols, phytosterols, squalene, and polyphenols which correspond to enhanced antioxidant activity. | All the compounds found in WO contribute to significant health benefits in humans . | Rotenone (ROT) is a lipophilic compound derived from tropical plants that can cross the bloodbrain barrier (BBB). | This makes ROT an ideal model for studying neuroprotection in PD. | Given these properties, the focus of our study was to investigate the potential role of Juglans regia (walnut oil), a phytochemical extract that is abundant in PUFAs and other antioxidant components and known for its powerful neuroprotective effects. | Our research aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective and antioxidant effects of WO in an in vitro PD model using the neurotoxin ROT to induce neurodegeneration. | Moreover, to explore whether microglial cells could provide neuroprotection to neurons, we used conditioned media (CM) from ROT-treated HMC3 cells and applied them to SH-SY5Y cells. | Cell viability was measured at multiple time points to track the effects over time and to obtain pharmacokinetic data regarding WO for the assessment of better conditions for neuroprotective recovery from damage. | These findings guide the selection of optimal conditionsROT concentration, WO concentration, and treatment durationfor evaluating the neuroprotective effects of WO in this PD model with HMC3 cells. | 2.8. Combined Effects of Rotenone and Walnut Oil Treatment on SH-SY5Y Cells To evaluate the potential neuroprotective effect of WO against rotenone-induced toxicity, the SH-SY5Y cells were treated with 20 µM rotenone, a concentration known to significantly decrease cell viability, in combination with 125 μgmL of WO. | Given this context, plant-based compounds like WO are being explored for their potential neuroprotective effects as novel therapeutic strategies for preventing and treating PD. | This research utilizes both in vivo and in vitro models to assess the efficacy of these compounds in mitigating disease progression. | Notably, immunoreactivity for glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) was elevated in dopaminergic neurons treated with DHA in an MPTP model compared to those treated with MPTP alone . | At the cellular level, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) was shown to enhance brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in SH-SY5Y cells exposed to MPP . | ROT, a commonly used neurotoxin for PD modeling, allows the observation of key PD features, including motor deficits, catecholamine depletion, and α-synuclein inclusions, making it valuable for neuroprotection studies. | In previous in vivo studies using Drosophila melanogaster, we examined the neuroprotective effects of WO, chosen for its high PUFA content. | We also treated SH-SY5Y cells with conditioned media from HMC3 cells exposed to ROT andor WO to investigate the microglial influence on neuronal survival in a non-contact co-culture environment. | While these results were obtained under different conditions, they suggest that higher omega-3 PUFA intake may confer neuroprotection against oxidative damage . | Other studies have investigated the neuroprotective effects of PUFAs on SH-SY5Y cells, such as Alarcon-Gil et al. | , who pretreated SH-SY5Y cells with linoleic acid and found neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects following exposure to 6-OHDA. | Our results align with previous studies examining the impact of BV-2 cell conditioned media on SH-SY5Y cells for other protective compound classes . | Our findings also indicate that in this in vitro model, supplementation with PUFAs from WO exhibits a neuroprotective effect against ROT-induced neurotoxicity. | The antioxidant and neuroprotective properties of WO, which is rich in PUFAs, were evaluated, demonstrating efficacy at the cellular level in reducing cytotoxicity and intracellular ROS production in both HMC3 and SH-SY5Y cell lines following exposure to the neurotoxin ROT. | However, the unsaponifiable fraction, comprising less than 1 of the oil, contains a diverse array of bioactive minor constituents, including tocopherols, phytosterols, and phenolic compounds. | Evidence on the neuroprotective action of the lipid component of WO comes from our previous research on a PD model on Drosophila in which it was highlighted that a WO supplementation in the diet was able to change the profile of lipids and, in particular, of PUFAs in the heads of flies. | However, to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying WOs neuroprotective action, future experiments should focus on the specific contributions of its omega-3 fatty acids, such as alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), in PD models. | Furthermore, research on the role of tocopherols and other minor bioactive compounds present in WO is necessary to clarify their relative contributions to its overall effects. | Such studies will be crucial for distinguishing the specific roles of fatty acids in neuroprotection. | Our focus was addressed mainly on fatty acids contribution to WOs neuroprotective role.",

In Vitro Screening All 4-aminoquinoline hydrazones and isatin hybrids, designated as (HD1-23 and HS1-12), respectively, were subjected to in vitro screening to assess their inhibitory efficacy against selected bacterial strains. | The screening commenced with an initial concentration of 10 mgmL as the upper limit for the classification of potent compounds. | The majority of the HD compounds exhibited measurable inhibitory zones against E. | Conversely, these compounds displayed minimal significant antimicrobial activity against B. | Notably, compounds HD1, HD4, HD6, and HD11 demonstrated good to moderate antibacterial activity across various bacterial strains. | Within the HS series, most compounds demonstrated inhibitory effects against E. | Among them, compounds HS7 and HS8 exhibited mild activity against the tested isolates. | 2.2.3. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Based on their zones of inhibition, the selected compounds HD1, HD4, HD6, HD11, HS2, HS7, and HS8 were further assessed as possible antibacterials. | In vitro screening of the compounds identified HD6 and HS8, among others, as having superior antibacterial activity against the tested bacterial strains, as shown in (Table 2). | This study concluded that HD6 and HS8 are selective inhibitors of these selective bacterial strains, warranting further investigation. | To evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of a compound, the ratios of MBC to MIC are compared. | If the MBCMIC ratio is 2, the compound is classified as bactericidal. | Conversely, a ratio between 2 and 16 suggests the compound is bacteriostatic. | (Supplementary Data Table S2) provides the MBC values and the ratios of MIC to MBC, denoted as R for HD and HS compounds against the bacterial strains, with MBC indicating the concentration required to kill 99.9 of bacteria. | In contrast, all HS compounds exhibited MBC values greater than 2 for all bacterial strains, indicating a lack of bactericidal capabilities. | 2.2.5. Disc Diffusion Assay The antibacterial effectiveness of the test compounds HD6 and HS8 were observed using the disc diffusion assay on MuellerHinton agar (MHA) plates at concentrations equivalent to their ½ MIC, MIC, and 2MIC values. | The assay demonstrated that the zones of clearance were dose-dependent, varying with the different concentrations of the two compounds used (Table 3). | Upon treatment with the compound HD6, increasing zones of inhibition were seen of 11 mm, 11 mm, and 12 mm for ½ MIC, MIC, and 2MIC, respectively, around the discs against Gram-positive S. | 2.2.6. Combination Study Table 4 provides a comprehensive in vitro analysis on the synergistic antibacterial activity of compounds HD6 and HS8 in combination with the standard antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) against four bacterial isolates. | These results suggest that the compound HD6 exhibits a strong synergistic effect (i.e., a many-fold decrease in MIC values of the test compounds) with the standard drug CIP, which might be beneficial for treating resistant bacterial strains through combination therapy. | The level of synergy between the examined compounds was assessed using the FICI (fractional inhibitory concentration index). | 2.2.7. Hemolytic Assay The in vitro toxicity of compound HD6 was evaluated through the procedure of hemolytic assay to investigate its effects on human red blood cells (hRBCs) across a range of concentrations from 50 to 800 μgmL, with ciprofloxacin as a control standard. | A total of 16 MDR strains were subjected to antimicrobial testing against the HD6 compound (Supplementary Materials Table S3). | The present study attempted to explore the potential of new 4-aminoquinoline-hydrazones and isatin-based hybrid compounds as antimicrobial agents. | Heterocyclic compounds, synthesized by the fusion of two or more active pharmacophores, have been critical towards the development of antimicrobial treatments. | The synthesized compounds demonstrated considerable antibacterial properties, with HD6 emerging as the most potent candidate. | aeruginosa (fractional inhibitory concentration index, FICI 0.37). | Future research should aim to elucidate the specific mechanisms of action of the most effective compounds, conduct in vivo studies to assess both efficacy and safety, and explore the structureactivity relationships (SAR) to optimize the pharmacological properties of these hybrids. | All compounds were purified by flash column chromatography with Combi Flash NextGen 100 (Teledyne ISCO, Lincoln, NE, USA) using a 230400 mesh silica gel purchased from Sisco Research Laboratories (Mumbai, India). | 5.1.2. General Procedure of 4-((7-Chloroquinolin-4-yl)amino)benzohydrazide (LN-2) In a dried round-bottom flask, compound LN-1 (1.0 equiv.) was dissolved in absolute ethanol followed by the addition of hydrazine hydrate (20 equiv.) dropwise. | 5.2.2. In Vitro Screening of Compounds The objective of this experiment was to assess all 35 compounds (HD1-23 and HS1-12) for their antibacterial activity against four different bacterial strains: E. | Initially, stock solutions of the test compounds were prepared at a concentration of 10mgmL in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to minimize solvent effects. | Plates were marked to identify the test compounds. | Sterile paper discs, soaked in the respective test compound solutions, were placed at predetermined distances on the agar using sterile forceps. | The antibacterial efficacies of the test compounds against the specified bacterial strains were thus determined. | 5.2.3. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) After conducting in vitro studies, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of selected compounds were determined. | Test compounds (HD1, 4, 6, 11; HS2, 7, 8) were evaluated against the four bacterial isolates using a 96-well microtiter plate. | The compounds were added to the wells containing nutrient broth, with the initial concentration set at 512 μgmL in the first column. | The MIC was determined as the lowest concentration of the compound that prevented observable bacterial growth, with all experiments conducted in biological triplicates . | 5.2.4. Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) Following the determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), a procedure was conducted to derive the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of the test compounds. | The smallest concentration that prevented bacterial growth on the medium was identified as the MBC of an examined compound. | 5.2.5. Disc Diffusion Assay Diffusion assay was carried out by using the bacterial strains to assess the potential antimicrobial properties of the selected test compounds, particularly the ones that exhibited low MIC values in comparison to the other tested compounds against the bacterial isolates, as per the NARMS . | Test compounds (HD6 and HS8) equivalent to their ½ MIC, MIC, and 2 MIC concentrations were placed onto the discs that were then stationed on plates filled with MHA and uniform bacterial smears. | Following the incubation period, the zones of inhibition (ZOIs) surrounding each disc were diligently measured in millimeters (mm) to denote the efficacy of each compound . | 5.2.6. Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index (FICI) The assessment of FICI, which assessed the potential synergistic action between the standard antibiotic ciprofloxacin and selected compounds HD6 and HS8, was facilitated through the effective application of the microdilution checkerboard procedure. | Simultaneously, a top-to-bottom dilution of each compound was devised to yield concentrations of 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, and 2 μgmL, constituting a wide range of combinations. | The degree of synergism between the tested compounds was evaluated in the context of the FICI (fractional inhibitory concentration index) using the standard formula:FICIMIC of the drug A in combination with BMIC of the drug A aloneMIC of the drug B in combination with AMIC of the drug B alone Synergy and antagonism were defined by FICI indices of 0.5 and 4, respectively. | 5.2.7. Hemolytic Assay The hemolytic potential of test compound HD6 was evaluated following a specific protocol. | For the assay, 100 microliters of the diluted suspension were transferred into microcentrifuge tubes in triplicate, each containing 100 microliters of different dilutions of the test compound, with matching buffer. | The percentage of RBCs lysed was calculated using the following formula: HemolysisOD of the test compound treated sampleOD of the buffer treated sampleOD of the 1 TritonX100 treated sampleOD of the buffer treated sample100 5.2.8. Zone of Inhibition of Environmental Resistant Strains A disc diffusion assay was conducted using multidrug-resistant strains that were taken from environmental waterbodies. | These were tested against the HD6 compound as this compound showed promising results in comparison to the other test compounds. | Notably, among all derivatives (HD1-23 and HS1-12), compound HD6 exhibited significant antibacterial efficacy, indicated by an MIC in the range of (816 μgmL) and an MBC of (8128 μgmL) against the bacterial strains E. | The docking analysis indicated favorable binding energy scores, suggesting the compounds capability to effectively inhibit bacterial growth. | Overall, these results signify the promising potential of the synthesized compound HD6 to be developed as an effective and safe antibacterial agent.",

In Silico Docking Study We employed molecular docking to explore the potential binding interactions of PCB with the receptor binding site of the target proteins and to elucidate their associated inhibitory and protective actions. | This computational technique is highly useful in structure-based drug design for its ability to predict and analyze how small molecules interact with biological targets. | In fact, intermolecular conventional hydrogen bonding is recognized as the most crucial factor in demonstrating the stability of the docking complex and, consequently, the ligands inhibitory effect on the protein. | These interactions are involved in complex stabilization and contribute to its inhibitory effect. | To further support our in vitro results, we conducted molecular docking studies to explore the binding of the main active compound of spirulina, PCB, to selected antioxidant and anti-inflammatory enzymes. | As one of Spirulinas most significant bioactive compounds, PCB is notable for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties . | An in vitro study identified PCB as the primary compound in spirulina responsible for its antioxidant effects . | We did not detect an inhibitory effect of SPAE in SOD activity but an ability to counteract LM- andor LPS-induced damage. | Additionally, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our compound compared to other docked molecules, such as mygalin , and compounds from Olea europaea L. | Altogether, the docking analysis results confirmed that the tested PCB compound showed a strong binding affinity for NADPH oxidase, SOD, COX-2, and iNOS enzymes, with promising binding patterns comparable to those of L-ascorbate, Dextromethorphan, and Celecoxib, thus supporting the notion that PCB could be mediating the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of SPAE on Caco-2 cells. | Secondly, although our in silico study was limited to PCB, the main and more studied antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound found in spirulina, we cannot rule out the possibility that other minor components such as vitamins, polysaccharides, or polyphenols in SPAE are also exerting protective actions on Caco-2 cells.",

      "text_block": "Despite TBI being a global public health concern, current treatment only focuses on symptom management, and no neuroprotective agents with an aim to protect or preserve brain structure and function after injury have been approved for use in the clinic . | This review discusses the impact of interventions using omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (O3 PUFAs) as neuroprotective agents for the alleviation of the effects of TBI and summarises the evidence from preclinical and clinical studies carried out so far. | TBI is also associated with oxidative stress, which reflects an imbalance between the production of oxidation-derived free radicals (such as superoxide anions, hydroxide radicals, and hydrogen peroxide) and the scavenging of these species through cellular antioxidant systems, such as the enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase and catalase, and compounds like glutathione . | The complex cascade of mechanisms unfolding after TBI offers multiple targets for neuroprotection of the adult and immature brain, but the field of neuroprotection in TBI has somewhat lost momentum following failures in the clinical translation of experimental data . | Fatty acids (FAs) are hydrophobic compounds that consist of a hydrocarbon chain of varying length and a terminal carboxylic acid group (COOH), and they can be part of more complex lipids (e.g. phospholipids, triacylglycerol or cholesteryl esters), or be free (i.e. non-esterified) FAs (FFAs) . | Specific markers of oxidative stress post-TBI include PUFA-derived compounds produced non-enzymatically through peroxidation, such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), derived from AA, and 4-hydroxyhexenal (4-HHE), derived from DHA ; these bioactive molecules can form adducts with DNA, proteins, and lipids. | These early observations, as well as clear efficacy signals for acutely administered DHA in traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) , led to the suggestion that long-chain PUFAs such as DHA had potential for neuroprotection in traumatic neurological injury . | Multiple experimental studies have investigated the therapeutic potential of O3 PUFAs as neuroprotective interventions in TBI (summary in Table 1), and the data indicate that an O3 PUFA intervention can have an overall wide therapeutic and prophylactic scope. | A higher dose of 50 mgkg in mouse CCI, initiated immediately after injury and continued daily for 8 days, showed that DHA had some neuroprotective effects, but overall did not significantly improve inflammation or brain function within the first week post-injury . | Similarly, a regime of intraperitoneal administration of 3 mgkg DHA and 7 mgkg EPA, first administered 2 h after CCI in mice and continued daily for 14 days, did not lead to longer-term improvements over 30 days post-injury regarding neuronal survival, cell proliferation, learning, and memory, but a different regimen, combining these injections with a dietary supplementation with fish oil (for a dietary final concentration of 4), did show some improvements in spatial learning and memory, reduced striatal neuronal loss, and increased production of neural

neuroprotective effects of O3 PUFAs by adopting regimens where supplementation was initiated prior to injury. | The effects of supplementation with fish oil for 1 month prior to injury was investigated in three studies; dietary supplementation with 8 fish oil was associated with an improvement in hippocampal neuronal survival and growth, a restoration of energy-sensing and genomic stability systems (such as silent information regulator 2 (Sir2) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)), a reduction in oxidative damage, and an improvement in learning and memory abilities , whereas there were no effects on hippocampal neuronal survival and function in a study with 6 fish oil supplementation . | Tyagi and colleagues implemented an O3-adequate diet (with 1.2 DHA and 0.24 EPA content) and compared it to a deficient diet (without DHA or EPA) in pregnant rat dams whose offspring were submitted to FPI, and noted that the deficiency worsened outcome in the elevated plus maze; decreased levels of the synaptic marker syntaxin-3, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and GAP-43 (a regeneration marker); and also amplified the expression of growth-inhibitory molecules and oxidative stress after injury . | 7.4. Interventional Studies in Humans Overall, experimental studies point towards the neuroprotective potential of O3 PUFAs in traumatic injury, with some discrepancies between studies that are likely due to differences in dosage, type of O3 PUFAs administered, mode of administration, frequency of administration, and TBI animal model used. | It is clear that the impact of these compounds on key pathophysiological mechanisms triggered by TBI (Figure 1) is significant across developmental time and animal species. | DHA-only treatments or combinations of DHA and EPA reduce cerebral oedema, apoptotic death, and neuronal loss, limit axonal injury and the loss of synaptic proteins, attenuate proinflammatory microglia and astrocytic activation, reduce oxidative stress, improve myelin preservation, and increase levels of neurotrophic factors (such as BDNF). | Over a period of 189 days, DHA supplementation significantly increased plasma DHA in a dose-dependent manner and led to an attenuated increase in serum NFL, coinciding with the active competitive season, suggesting that the prophylactic use of DHA in the high-risk population of contact sport athletes may confer neuroprotection . | A relative depletion in O3 PUFAs is particularly important to be addressed in children and adolescents, as these compounds have an important neurodevelopmental role, and decreased levels of DHA in the developing brain leads to deficits in neurogenesis and alterations in learning and visual function . | Long-chain PUFAs such as EPA and DHA have complex pharmacodynamics and a wide array of potential targets, but at present, there is little understanding regarding which receptor targets are critical for efficacy of these compounds in TBI, especially in humans. | More research is required to characterise the receptor or receptor combinations that are major mediators of the neuroprotective effects. | Linked to this aspect, and to the possibility of the beneficial effects of O3 PUFAs involving multiple receptors, it is important to note an ongoing debate in the field of neuroprotection research for neurotrauma regarding the targeting of single mechanisms, or the opposite, i.e. the use of pleiotropic compounds. | Would the use of compounds with pleiotropic effects and multiple targets have a higher chance of success? | An example of a single mechanism and target-specific neuroprotective intervention that failed in TBI is that of magnesium to block NMDA glutamate receptor-mediated toxicity . | Results showed that patients receiving the lower dose did significantly worse than those on placebo, and there was increased mortality at the higher magnesium dose compared to the placebo group, suggesting that not only was magnesium not neuroprotective but that it was potentially harmful. | In this instance, two large multicentre clinical trials showed that there was no difference in TBI outcome at 6 months, even after intervention was initiated as early as 4 h after injury, with continued administration of the compound for up to 120 h and this is in spite of numerous preclinical studies showing efficacy in TBI models . | Recent years have also seen an increase in reports of intrinsic neuroprotective effects of bioactive lipid mediators derived from long-chain O3 PUFAs. Several studies demonstrated positive neuropathological and neurobehavioural effects in experimental TBI models after the acute administration of lipid mediators such as resolvins D1 and E1 (RvD1 and RvE1, respectively), docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide (DHEA), and neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), using various administration regimens (Table 2) . | The issue of whether O3 PUFAs can be developed into a preparation with neuroprotective effects is equally important in the field of SCI. | The secondary injury cascade after traumatic injury of the spinal cord has many physiopathological similarities with TBI, and data obtained by us and other groups have shown clear potential of DHA for neuroprotection in the acute phase of SCI . | Therefore, a successful neuroprotective intervention with O3 PUFAs could address complex therapeutic challenges in injury in the CNS across a wide spectrum of unmet needs. | Brain markers: ASC: apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (caspase recruitment domain), ATP: adenosine triphosphate, BBB: bloodbrain barrier, BDNF: brain-derived neurotrophic factor, CD11b86200: cluster of differentiation 11b, 86, or 200, COX-2: cyclooxygenase-2, CytC: cytochrome C, FRP2: N-formyl peptide receptor 2, GFAP: glial fibrillary acidic protein, GLAST: glutamate aspartate transporter, GLUT13: glucose transporter 1 or 3, Iba1: ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1, IL-1β66R: interleukin 1 beta, 6 or 6R, LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3, MCP-1: monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, miR: microRNA, MnSOD: manganese superoxide dismutase, n-: neuronal, NeuN: neuronal nuclear protein, NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa B, NLRP3: NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3, NOS: nitric oxide synthase, SOD: superoxide dismutase, S100B: S100 calcium-binding protein B, TLR4: toll-like receptor 4, TNF-α: tumour necrosis factor-alpha, TRX2: thioredoxin 2, TUNEL: terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling, 3-NT: 3-nitrotyrosine. | As mentioned previously, it may also be possible to enhance the effect of O3 PUFAs by combining them with other compounds to achieve mechanistic synergism. | For example, a proprietary preparation, which is a medical multi-nutrient containing O3 PUFAs (DHA and EPA) and other compounds involved in the biosynthesis of phospholipids (which are depleted after TBI ), has shown significant effects in mouse CCI both for improved neurological outcome and for tissue protection . | Conclusions The studies reviewed here indicate that O3 PUFAs are compounds that could significantly decrease the impact of traumatic injuries of the CNS across a spectrum of severities and in both the immature and the adult brain. | Notwithstanding the remaining questions highlighted above, whose answers will help optimise the interventions, the pragmatic approach that has already led to the first interventional studies in mild TBI confirms the promise of these compounds and shows the path ahead towards a precision medicine-informed effective intervention.",

Neuroprotective Effects of MDE in Parkinsons Disease Cell Model A Parkinsons disease cell model was induced in PC12 cells by treating them with 1 μM of rotenone, which is a commonly used method for evaluating neuroprotection in vitro . | The potential neuroprotective effects of MDE and edaravone were assessed through various assays, including cell cycle analysis, apoptosis detection, and migration studies. | This reduction in ROS production could be an important mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effects of MDE and edaravone in rotenone-treated PC12 cells. | However, when these cells were treated with various concentrations of MDE and edaravone, only faint green fluorescence was observed, suggesting that both compounds were able to partially restore mitochondrial function, even at low MDE concentrations (12.5 μgmL). | Moreover, edaravone has demonstrated neuroprotective effects in other neurodegenerative conditions, including Parkinsons disease, Alzheimers disease, and meningitis . | The physical properties of MDE, compared to free edaravone, show remarkable improvements in neuroprotection, including enhanced aqueous solubility and stability. | It was quite clear that MDEs physical properties for neuroprotection were improved compared with free edaravone; its aqueous solubility and stability were enhanced by employing MPEG-2000-DSPE as a nanocarrier. | Moreover, it has been noted that smaller nanoparticles are more effective at utilizing the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which helps the drug passively target brain lesions and improve neuroprotective outcomes . | The primary neuroprotective effects of MDE in this model were as follows: (1) reduction in rotenone-induced cell death and apoptosis; (2) prevention of cell cycle arrest caused by rotenone exposure; (3) inhibition of ROS overproduction; and (4) protection of mitochondria from rotenone-induced damage in PC12 cells. | These results suggest that encapsulating edaravone within MPEG-2000-DSPE nanoparticles enhances its neuroprotective properties, potentially offering a more effective approach for PD treatment. | These results suggest that MDE offers robust protection against rotenone-induced toxicity in an in vitro PD model, thus providing deeper insight into edaravones neuroprotective mechanisms. | MDE demonstrated significantly stronger neuroprotective and antioxidant effects compared with free edaravone.",

      "title": "Diversity of Microglia-Derived Molecules with Neurotrophic Properties That Support Neurons in the Central Nervous System and Other Tissues",
      "text_block": "Microglia, the brain immune cells, support neurons by producing several established neurotrophic molecules including glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). | Modern analytical techniques have identified numerous phenotypic states of microglia, each associated with the secretion of a diverse set of substances, which likely include not only canonical neurotrophic factors but also other less-studied molecules that can interact with neurons and provide trophic support. | In this review, we consider the following eight such candidate cytokines: oncostatin M (OSM), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), activin A, colony-stimulating factor (CSF)-1, interleukin (IL)-34, growthdifferentiation factor (GDF)-15, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-2. | The available literature provides sufficient evidence demonstrating murine cells produce these cytokines and that they exhibit neurotrophic activity in at least one neuronal model. | Several distinct types of neurotrophic activity are identified that only partially overlap among the cytokines considered, reflecting either their distinct intrinsic properties or lack of comprehensive studies covering the full spectrum of neurotrophic effects. | Further studies on these potential microglia-derived neurotrophic factors are warranted since they may be used as targeted treatments for diverse neurological disorders. | They maintain functional neurons, the signaling cells of the brain, by secreting neurotrophic factors. | Microglia are capable of producing a large number of molecules that act as immunomodulators, cytotoxins, or neurotrophic factors. | Microglia display phenotypic plasticity by altering their functions and morphology depending on their surrounding environment, including extracellular matrix, stimulants, inhibitors, and other cell types they encounter (reviewed in ). | Conversely, activation of inflammation-resolving pathways in microglia results in the release of anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic factors (reviewed in ). | Our review illustrates that similar to their secretion of neurotoxins, reactive microglia are likely to secrete a mixture of neurotrophic molecules, the composition of which depends on the species, nature of the stimulating agent, and the surrounding microenvironment. | 1.2. Effect of Neurotrophic Factors The growth, differentiation, and survival of developing and mature neurons are all modulated by tightly controlled exposure to neurotrophic factors (reviewed in ). | For the purposes of this review, molecules are considered neurotrophic if they have the capacity to facilitate at least one of the following processes: neuronal proliferation, differentiation of neuronal precursors, growth of pre-existing and new neuronal projections, and survival or recovery after neuronal damage. | 1.3. Microglia-Derived Neurotrophic Factors Previous literature includes a number of extensive reviews that are typically focused on a subset of microglia-derived proteins with proven and widely accepted neurotrophic functions. | They include brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), neurotrophin (NT)-3, and NT-45 (reviewed in ). | However, there are other proteins and peptides that are not yet considered prototypical microglia-derived neurotrophic factors, but experimental evidence has been collected indicating they (1) are secreted by either surveying or reactive microglia, (2) interact with neurons by binding to a corresponding receptor or receptors, and (3) this interaction leads to neurotrophic effects under certain experimental conditions. | In this review, we consider the following eight cytokines secreted by microglia that bind to distinct neuronal targets and demonstrate neurotrophic effects in vitro or in the CNS: oncostatin M (OSM), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), activin A, colony-stimulating factor (CSF)-1, interleukin (IL)-34, growthdifferentiation factor (GDF)-15, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-2 (Figure 1). | While these and several other studies suggest that OSM is likely a neuroprotective molecule, its neurotrophic activity in both murine and human models requires more detailed investigations. | One of them is the glycoprotein (gp)130α, and the other can be either an OSMRß or leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR)ß subunit . | OSMR1 consists of a gp130α and a leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR)ß subunit, while OSMR2 is composed of the same subunits as the murine OSMR . | The ubiquitous presence of gp130α mRNA has been reported for both murine and human excitatory and inhibitory neurons , and in C57BL6 mice, there is evidence of gp130 protein expression by CNS neurons . | B-27 supplement-deprived primary murine cortical neurons exposed to OSM demonstrate increased viability compared to untreated cells, indicating that OSM may possess neuroprotective activity. | Similarly, in a rat model of ischemic stroke induced by left MCAO, intracerebral injection of hOSM promotes neuronal survival and reduces the severity of neurological deficits such as impaired reflexes, lost balance, and decreased grip strength compared to animals not treated with this cytokine . | Furthermore, the intracellular signaling mechanisms responsible for the neurotrophic effects of OSM need to be established. | Future studies should focus on the Janus kinase (JAK)signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway since it is activated by binding of OSM to OSMR complexes in murine neurons . | Leukemia Inhibitory Factor 3.1. Overview of Structure and Function Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a 20 kDa pleiotropic cytokine belonging to the IL-6 cytokine family. | Further research into the responses of human cells and tissues to LIF is required to fully elucidate the neurotrophic properties of this molecule. | Administration of nicardipine, a Ca2 channel blocker, inhibits the neurotrophic effect of activin A, as does treatment with cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor. | These neuroprotective effects are observed after 8 days and 8 weeks . | In a control experiment with an identical timeline, ICV injection of saline, followed by ICV infusion of activin A, increases neuronal proliferation, indicating that activin A has neurotrophic effects in both pathological and physiological conditions. | While this in vitro study is indicative of the neuroprotective effects of activin A on human neurons, the neurotrophic effects of activin A in the human brain or on human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons have not yet been elucidated, and further studies are required. | Although the actions of CSF-1 on neurons remain to be fully characterized, it exhibits certain neurotrophic and protective activity toward this cell type (reviewed in ). | In the resting state, CSF1R is in an inactive autoinhibitory conformation. | Activation of CSF1R involves exposure of the autoinhibitory juxtamembrane region to the cytoplasm, resulting in the receptor adopting an active extended conformation . | The CREB signaling pathway has already been linked to improved neuronal survival in mice and, therefore, could be responsible for the neurotrophic effect of CSF-1, but this hypothesis will require experimental proof in both mice and humans . | Interestingly, the maximal neurotrophic effect of CSF-1 in rat hippocampal neurons is achieved at 1 ngmL but a ten-times higher concentration of this cytokine is needed to induce the maximal protective response in cortical neurons. | In summary, exposure of cultured rat neurons isolated from different brain regions to hCSF-1 results in improved cell survival, proliferation, and neurite outgrowth, helping establish the neurotrophic role of this cytokine . | While there is a lack of evidence for the protective actions of hCSF-1 on human neurons, the neurotrophic activity of this cytokine has been studied in murine tissues. | However, the neuroprotective function of CSF-1 is not limited to KA-induced injuries. | Delivery of exogenous microencapsulated hCSF-1 to the site of injury facilitates neuronal survival and reduces infarct size resulting from surgically induced ischemic lesions in the murine cerebral cortex. | Due to its relatively recent discovery, many aspects of IL-34 biological activity remain poorly understood; however, its neurotrophic and protective effects in the CNS have been observed. | Direct evidence of neuroprotective and neuron survival-promoting properties of IL-34 has also been collected . | The neuroprotection offered by IL-34 is comparable to that of systemically administered recombinant hCSF-1 in the same murine model of neuronal damage . | Given the neurotrophic effects of IL-34 that have been observed in vitro and the known downstream signaling of CSF1R, syndecan-1, and PTP-ζ in murine models, the in vivo activities of this cytokine should be explored further to identify potential new treatments for neuropathologies associated with neuronal injury. | GrowthDifferentiation Factor-15 7.1. Overview of Structure and Function Growthdifferentiation factor (GDF)-15, also known as macrophage inhibitory cytokine (MIC)-1, is a 30 kDa disulfide-linked homodimer belonging to the TGF-β superfamily of proteins . | In the CNS, its modulation of appetite and food intake has made GDF-15 a molecule of interest in weight loss research , and its neurotrophic effects remain relatively unexplored in comparison. | In the peripheral nervous system, GDF-15 is thought to be a neurotrophic factor since both GDF-15 mRNA and protein are upregulated following dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nerve lesions in mice . | The effects of GDF-15 on food intake and obesity are being extensively researched, but its potential neurotrophic effects remain largely unexplored. | In this experiment, GDF-15 activates Akt and suppresses ERK leading to reduced c-Jun phosphorylation, inhibition of ROS generation, and promotion of neuronal survival . | In an in vitro mouse model of PD GDF-15 exerts a neuroprotective effect, rescuing primary cultures of ventral midbrain neurons from GDF-15 knockout mice following treatment with 6OHDA . | Another study using GDF-15 knockout mice finds that these animals display progressive postnatal losses of motoneurons highlighting the neurotrophic effect of this protein during neurodevelopment . | Overall, there is sufficient evidence identifying GDF-15 as a cytokine that should be studied further as a neurotrophic factor with potentially beneficial effects in human neurodegenerative diseases. | FGF-2 exerts neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects on cultured murine CGNs by reducing spontaneous as well as alcohol-induced death of these cells. | This indicates that MAPKs may mediate the neuroprotective and growth-promoting effects of FGF-2 . | 8.4. Neurotrophic Effects Culturing neurons in serum-free, low insulin medium minimizes confounding factors when assessing the neurotrophic effects of proteins. | This demonstrates the neuroprotective effects of FGF-2 on neurons damaged by axonal transection . | It can be concluded that the available evidence from both murine and human models indicates that FGF-2 can be released by microglia to act as a neurotrophic molecule supporting the growth, survival, and differentiation of neurons in the CNS. | IGF-2 has similar effects on CNS cells and acts as a neuroprotective agent by promoting the survival of neurons . | Co-injection of IGF-2 with IGF2R-specific inhibitors eliminates memory enhancement achieved by administration of the growth factor on its own. | IGF-2 is also neuroprotective against corticosterone-induced damage in adult rat cortical neuronal cultures . | This is mediated by the activation of IGF1R, as evidenced by the use of specific IGF1R inhibitors that completely block the neurite outgrowth-promoting effects of IGF-2 . | While the neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects of IGF-2 have been documented by multiple studies, the secretion of this cytokine by microglia has not been established conclusively; therefore, it is imperative to study the regulation of its expression in surveying and reactive microglia in different species before IGF-2 can be regarded as a microglia-derived neurotrophic factor. | Conclusions Even though microglia, alongside astrocytes, are a known source of neurotrophic factors, the majority of review articles detailing this aspect of microglial contributions to CNS homeostasis highlight several proteins with already established neurotrophic activities including BDNF, GDNF, NGF, NT-3, and NT-45. | In this review article, we chose to focus on eight different molecules that so far have not been viewed as canonical microglia-derived neurotrophic factors, but yet have sufficient evidence supporting their expression andor secretion by microglia as well as indications of their trophic and protective effects on neurons (Figure 1, Table 2). | We also conclude that the demonstrated neurotrophic effects for each of the eight cytokines are varied and include increased neuronal survival or proliferation, recovery of neurons after insult, enhanced neurite outgrowth, increased differentiation, and attenuation of neurodegeneration (Figure 1, Table 2). | All of the considered cytokines are shown to increase neuronal survival in one or more neuronal cell models. | However, after this initial similarity, the neurotrophic effects of individual cytokines begin to diversify. | Currently, it is not clear whether such partially overlapping neurotrophic activities are true characteristics of the reviewed cytokines or an illustration of the fragmented nature of our current knowledge related to these molecules as neurotrophic factors. | Comprehensive studies using each of the cytokines and covering the full spectrum of neurotrophic effects are needed to answer this question. | We feel such further research is warranted due to the already available preclinical studies using in vitro and in vivo systems which demonstrate neurotrophic effects of these cytokines in models of ischemic stroke, hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, ICH, TBI, axotomy, hypokalemia, iron intoxication, immunodeficiency, steroid toxicity, inflammation, excitotoxic injury, SCI, and a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, including AD, MS, PD, and HD (Table 2). | Only more comprehensive future research could establish which of these disorders could benefit from interventions using or targeting the signaling pathways triggered by each of the microglia-derived cytokines potentially possessing neurotrophic properties.",

      "text_block": "Emphasis is placed on the effects of these extracts as phytocomplexes rather than isolated compounds. | To trigger angiogenesis, the production of activators must increase while the production of inhibitors decreases. | Even common medications such as aspirin, β-blockers, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors are being re-evaluated for their potential to inhibit blood vessel formation and offer new avenues for cancer prevention. | With ongoing research and increased awareness, harnessing natural compounds holds the potential to revolutionise cancer prevention, elevating its importance to that of treatments . | Pomegranate: A Multifunctional Natural Powerhouse in Cancer Prevention Plants have a long-standing history in cancer therapy, with nearly three-quarters of anti-tumour compounds used in modern medicine being natural products or their derivatives . | Each portion contains beneficial compounds (Figure 3) . | The juice is rich in water, macro and microelements, carbohydrates, pectins, organic acids, several polyphenols, and other compounds such as fatty acids, amino acids and tocopherols. | Pomegranate extracts have also demonstrated neuroprotective effects by lowering soluble human amyloid beta (Aβ42) peptide levels and reducing amyloid deposition in the hippocampus, which is relevant for improving Alzheimers disease outcomes and enhancing memory following ischemia . | Sustainable Extraction and Valorisation of Pomegranate Bioactive Compounds in a Circular Economy Pomegranate bioactive compounds, particularly those found in fruits and their by-products like peels and kernels, are extracted using both traditional and green techniques (Figure 4). | This approach enhances the juice with higher concentrations of bioactive compounds, though it may alter the flavour . | However, some traditional methods raise sustainability concerns due to the use of potentially toxic solvents and the risk of degrading thermolabile nutritional compounds during processing . | These methods reduce energy consumption and solvent use while preserving the integrity of bioactive compounds. | Despite their environmental benefits and effectiveness in maintaining compound stability, they still face challenges in scalability and standardisation for industrial applications . | These processes must be carefully selected and fine-tuned to minimise the degradation of bioactive compounds and ensure stability during storage . | Integrating these technologies into the biorefinery of pomegranate by-products improves mass transfer and facilitates solvent access to target compounds. | These methods systematically recover valuable compounds through multiple extraction steps, each designed to target specific molecules in the raw

compounds also exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, further contributing to their antiangiogenic effects . | Notably, punicalin has demonstrated neuroprotective effects, showing promise in mitigating neuroinflammation, improving learning and enhancing memory function in animal models. | These versatile bioactive compounds from pomegranates hold significant therapeutic potential due to their diverse pharmacological activities. | They exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, cardioprotective, antiviral and antibacterial properties . | Punicic acid

significant neuroprotective effects . | More recent and comprehensive studies are needed to fully elucidate its potential benefits in neuroprotection and cancer therapy. | Lipoic acid, a sulphur-containing compound with potent antioxidant properties derived from caprylic acid, plays a pivotal role in regulating angiogenesis. | These compounds either directly target tumour cells or enhance the bodys immune response, demonstrating significant therapeutic efficacy in cancer treatment . | Molecular analysis revealed that galactomannan downregulates key pro-angiogenic and pro-metastatic factors such as VEGF, MMP-2 and MMP-9 while upregulating the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. | Pomegranate extracts also elevated the levels of Asymmetric Dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of eNOS that functions as a negative regulator of angiogenesis. | In a study involving MCF-7 breast cancer cells co-cultured with adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), pomegranate seed extract enhanced the inhibitory effects of ADSCs on cancer cell viability and proliferation, increased apoptosis, and downregulated VEGF gene expression . | Survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family, is highly expressed in most human tumours and foetal tissues and is capable of independently promoting VEGF expression. | These effects were attributed to punicalin, punicalagin and ellagic acid, compounds present also in the roots, through antioxidant mechanisms and the inhibition of VEGF and VEGF-like growth factors . | Beyond their antiangiogenic properties, the diverse bioactive compounds found in various parts of the pomegranatesuch as juice, peels, kernels and rootscontribute to a wide range of biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and pro-apoptotic effects. | Certain techniques, particularly green extraction methods, have been shown to enhance the bioavailability and potency of active

      "text_block": "At these conditions, the total flavonoid content (TFC) and the inhibitory capacities against butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes were also evaluated, indicating that the aerial part extracts had higher TFC and LOX inhibitory capacity than the root extracts but lower activity against BChE. | The comprehensive LCGC-MS chemical characterization allowed for the tentative identification of 222 compounds belonging to 66 chemical subclasses, the abundancies of which widely varied depending on the matrix and the extraction conditions used. | Conclusions: The results obtained together with the application of advanced statistical analysis and molecular docking simulations suggested several sesquiterpenoids, such as selina-3,7(11)-diene, guaiol acetate, α-cyperone, and farnesyl acetate, as the molecules responsible of the in vitro results observed, with good neuroprotective potential against AD. | In the last decades, there has been growing interest in bioactive compounds obtained from natural sources and researchers have significantly contributed to the identification of various natural compounds that exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cholinesterase (ChE) activities . | It has been reported that the genus Ferula possesses a diverse array of pharmacological properties, including chemopreventive effects against cancer, anti-inflammatory and lipoxygenase inhibitory activities, reversal of multidrug resistance, and antimicrobial activity . | In this regard, nutraceuticals and bioactive compounds have emerged as promising therapeutic approaches that could prevent or retard AD occurrence owing to their multiple neuroprotective mechanisms . | Among the available natural sources, the genus Ferula is well documented as a rich source of biologically active compounds, especially sesquiterpene coumarins . | Moreover, a variety of chemical constituents, such as polysulfides and volatile compounds, have been isolated from F. | To extract these health-beneficial compounds, conventional techniques such as agitation, maceration, and Soxhlet extraction are commonly used, but they are known to require prolonged extraction times . | By contrast, the utilization of advanced environmentally friendly extraction techniques, such as compressed fluids (e.g., pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE)), offers several advantages, such as reducing organic solvent volume and extraction times, as well as enhancing the extraction yield of bioactive compounds by increasing the mass transfer rate between the solvent and the biomass . | For instance, PLE has proven its suitability for extracting bioactive compounds from plants, including phenolic and terpenoid compounds, and these compounds have been identified as potential neuroprotective molecules owing to their anti-cholinesterase, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory capacities . | could be a good source of compounds with multifaceted potential against different Alzheimers disease (AD) hallmarks and can be obtained using compressed fluids. | Therefore, the present study aims to optimize the extraction process based on different response variables (such as the total phenolicflavonoid content and the evaluation of diverse in vitro neuroprotective mechanisms related to AD), to perform a comprehensive chemical characterization of the extracts using HPLC-MSMS and GC-MS to identify the bioactive compounds that could be responsible for the observed in vitro results, and to apply advanced statistical analysis and molecular docking simulations to select and evaluate the affinity of the most promising compounds for the active sites of different enzymes related to AD. | After the extraction, the extracts were dried under nitrogen flow, and the extraction yield, TPC, ROS scavenging capacity, and AChE inhibitory activity were evaluated as response variables utilizing response surface methodology (RSM). | The AChE and BChE inhibitory activities of the F. | Galantamine hydrobromide was used as the reference inhibitor and 50 EtOH was used as blank control. | Finally, the LOX inhibitory activity of the F. | Quercetin was used as a reference inhibitor and 25 EtOH was used as a blank control. | The chromatograms were analyzed using MS-DIAL v4.9 software to obtain the relative abundances (as area under the curve (AUC)) and for the tentative identification of the compounds (by comparison with MSMS spectra from NIST, LipidBLAST, and MoNA databases). | Mass spectra deconvolution of the chromatographic signals was performed using Agilent Mass Hunter Unknown Analysis software (v10.0), and the tentative identification of the compounds was performed using the NIST MS Search v.2.3 and Fiehn Lib databases. | The compounds were identified by comparison of the retention indices (RI, semi-standard non-polar) with those contained in the NIST database or reported in the literature. | MS-DIAL v4.9 software was used to obtain the relative abundances of the compounds (as AUC). | 2.8. Molecular Docking Molecular docking simulations were performed to evaluate the affinity of selected compounds for the active sites of AChE, BChE, and LOX enzymes. | The current docking study used the published crystal structures of the proteins in complex with different inhibitors, including AChE-huprine W (PDB ID: 4BDT), BChE-tacrine (PDB ID: 4BDS) , and LOX-epigallocatechin gallate (PDB ID: 1JNQ) , which were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (http:www.rscb.orgpdb, accessed on 22 July 2024). | Thereafter, the 3 proteins, 19 ligands (acetylleucine, 4-methyl-5-thiazoleethanol, β-asarone, N-(2-phenylethyl)acetamide, farnesyl acetate, thymidine, cis,cis-linoleic acid, isofraxidin, kaempferol, α-hydroxybutyric acid, nobiletin, γ-sitosterol, guaiol acetate, selina-3,7(11)-diene, 2-hydroxypalmitic acid, stearic acid, palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, and α-cyperone), and the standard inhibitors galantamine and quercetin were prepared according to using Chimera software (v. | Aerial Parts and Roots The extraction of bioactive compounds from F. | However, a higher extraction yield does not necessarily indicate better bioactive properties, and therefore the TPC, ROS scavenging capacity, and AChE inhibitory activity of all of the PLE extracts were measured. | These findings suggested that the nature of the compounds contributing to the TPC, ROS, and AChE activities might be relatively non-polar (see Section 3.4). | In addition, three more complementary assays were performed (TFC, BChE inhibitory capacity, and LOX inhibitory activity) to obtain a wider view of the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory potential of the obtained extracts (Table 4). | However, this reduction did not necessarily mean a reduction in bioactivity, as this activity depends on the selective extraction of specific compounds. | Moreover, shorter extraction times combined with the absence of oxygen during the extraction and the highly controlled temperature of the PLE system can avoid the degradation andor the occurrence of secondary reactions of valuable compounds. | In terms of ChE inhibitory capacity, the Aerial Opt extract showed a significantly higher activity against AChE compared to the Root Opt extract, whereas the activity against BChE was higher for the Root Opt extract. | This is the first time that ChE inhibitory capacity has been reported for F. | The IC50 value for LOX inhibitory capacity was lower for the Aerial Opt extract than for the Root Opt extract. | Moreover, the value obtained for the Aerial Opt extract was close to the reference LOX inhibitor (quercetin) used in this study, and it could be considered as good . | The higher potency of the Aerial Opt extract could have been related to its higher TFC and ROS scavenging capacity, and previous studies have demonstrated and extensively discussed the anti-inflammatory activity (as LOX inhibitors) of flavonoids . | In addition, these values were similar to those obtained from orange juice by-products and thinned peaches after different drying processes , which have shown promising neuroprotective potential . | Combining the results from all of the extracts (those obtained using H2O, EtOH, EtAc, and CPME at 115 C and those obtained under optimum conditions), 170 and 53 compounds were tentatively identified with high confidence by LC-MSMS and GC-MS, respectively. | It has to be noted that α-humulene was identified in both the LC-MSMS and GC-MS analyses, but because the confidence in its identification was higher in GC-MS, this compound was only retained in the GC-MS data. | In total, 222 compounds belonging to 66 chemical subclasses were identified (Table S2). | Among these chemical subclasses, the most represented were sesquiterpenoids, amino acids, peptides, and analogs, carbohydrates and carbohydrate conjugates, fatty acids and conjugates, and alcohols and polyols, with 27, 19, 15, 15, and 12 compounds, respectively. | persica have confirmed the presence of different phenolic compounds and flavonoids (such as quercetin, catechin, vanillic acid, ferulic acid, coumarins, and caffeic acid), some of which have demonstrated neuroprotective activity . | In addition, several compounds that belong to hydroxycoumarins (fraxidin, isofraxidin, 7-hydroxy-6-methoxycoumarin, and 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin) and to quinic acids and derivatives (quinic acid, chlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid, methyl chlorogenate, 5-O-feruloylquinic acid, 3-O-feruloylquinic acid, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, 1,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, and 3-O-p-coumaroylquinic acid) subclasses were also identified, many of them with reported antioxidant activity . | persica, showing sesquiterpene coumarins and sulfur compounds as the main components . | For instance, 61 components (phenylpropanoids, oxygenated monoterpenes, monoterpene hydrocarbons, sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes, and essential oil) were identified in the aerial parts , while 39 compounds (sulfur compounds, oxygenated monoterpenes, and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons) were identified in the roots. | The abundancy of these compounds widely varied under the different extraction conditions, and the area under the curve of each extraction condition as well as the results of the different statistical analyses are presented in Table S2. | The PCA established two principal components (PC1PC2) when using the abundancy of the individual compounds, explaining 31.6 (PC1) and 20.5 (PC2) of the variance (Figure 1A). | Moreover, the dendrogram analysis performed using the total abundancy of the different subclasses of compounds provided similar but not exactly the same results (Figure 1C). | As expected, these results indicated that the different solvents applied to the two matrices affected both the individual compounds and the chemical subclasses to which they belong. | Furthermore, the PLS-DA analysis provided 34 compounds with VIP scores 1.5 (Figure 1D), which were responsible for the separation observed between the different extracts (Figure 1E). | Most of these compounds, except syringaresinol glucoside, had higher abundancy in the aerial part extracts, and more specifically in the CPME and EtAc extracts. | Other compounds, such as glycoside derivatives (from flavonoids and lignans), had higher abundancy in the EtOH and H2O aerial part extracts. | Additionally, three interesting compounds that could be pinpointed from this analysis were those with maximum abundancy in the extracts obtained under optimum conditions, such as luteolin and kaempferol (in the aerial part extract) and 3-hydroxymyristic acid (in the root extract). | These results demonstrated the different distribution of compounds, such flavonoids, in the different fractions of F. | persica, but they also highlighted this subclass of compounds, in their free and glycosylated forms, as contributors to the in vitro neuroprotective capacity observed in the extracts obtained under optimum conditions. | For the ChemRICH analysis, the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) and the subclass of each tentatively identified compound were used, as well as the fold change (FC) and p-value for each pairwise comparison (Opt-CPME, Opt-EtAc, Opt-EtOH, and Opt-H2O) (these values are presented in Table S2). | In the case of the aerial part samples, the optimum conditions highly increased the extraction efficiency of methoxyphenols and monoterpenoids (except with respect to CPME) and other subclasses to a lesser extent (such as amino acids, benzoic acids, carbonyl compounds, flavones, or O-methylated flavonoids). | In the case of the monoterpenoid subclass, five of the identified compounds were acetate derivatives (4-terpinyl acetate, bornyl acetate, fenchyl acetate, lavandulyl acetate, and α-terpinyl acetate), and α-terpinyl acetate and bornyl acetate have demonstrated good neuroprotective potential . | These last results may have been a consequence of: (i) the use of non-polar solvents (EtAc and CPME), as those compounds are mainly water soluble; and (ii) the use high temperature (180 C), as this parameter has previously been demonstrated to increase the degradation of glycosides when using PLE technology . | In the case of the root samples, the optimum conditions increased the extraction of many subclasses of compounds, such as alcohols and polyols, amino acids, benzoic acids, carbonyl compounds, or methoxyphenols. | In this regard, a number of monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids have demonstrated interesting neuroprotective properties , such as nerolidol, caryophyllene oxide, α-humulene, or α-bisabolol . | Thereafter, the abundancy of the individual compounds was compared among different extracts of the same matrix using ANOVA, revealing that most of them were affected by the extraction conditions (Table S2). | Among these compounds, cinnamic acid derivatives (such as 2,5-dihydroxycinnamic acid) possess the ability to inhibit cholinesterase , and β-carbolines (such as harman and norharman) have been described as having good antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects . | Other compounds, such as chrysoeriol, can confer neuroprotection , and 3,4-dihydroxyacetophenone, which can cross the bloodbrain barrier, was shown to be positively correlated with the neuroprotective potential of thinned peaches extracts . | Some of these compounds could have been obtained during the extraction process due to the high extraction temperature used (180 C), which has been shown to help extract phenolic acids , releasing free flavonoids from more complex molecules or forming other bioactive compounds, such as melanoidins . | Furthermore, to identity those compounds that could be responsible of the in vitro neuroprotective activity observed, a Pearsons correlation test between the abundancy of the compounds and ROS and AChE activities was performed (Table S2). | In the case of the aerial part samples, this analysis revealed that 50 compounds were significantly correlated with ROS scavenging capacity, while 16 were correlated with AChE inhibitory activity (r 0.8 and p-value 0.1). | Among them, 12 compounds (acetylleucine, 4-methyl-5-thiazoleethanol, β-asarone, N-(2-phenylethyl)acetamide, farnesyl acetate, thymidine, cis,cis-linoleic acid, isofraxidin, kaempferol, α-hydroxybutyric acid, nobiletin, and γ-sitosterol) were correlated with both activities (Table 5). | In the case of the root samples, and following the same criteria, 38 and 81 compounds were significantly correlated with ROS and AChE activities, respectively. | Among them, 8 compounds (guaiol acetate, selina-3,7(11)-diene, 2-hydroxypalmitic acid, kaempferol, stearic acid, palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, and α-cyperone) were correlated with both activities (Table 5). | Some of these compounds, such as isofraxidin β-asarone , nobiletin , α-cyperone , and kaempferol , have already demonstrated interesting neuroprotective properties. | 3.5. Molecular Docking Simulations Based on these promising results, molecular docking simulations were performed to evaluate the binding affinities of different complexes between the 19 compounds significantly correlated with ROS and AChE activities and the target enzymes AChE, BChE, and LOX (Table 5). | Galantamine and quercetin were used as standard inhibitors. | Many of these interactions have already been described for compounds targeting acetylcholinesterase . | However, it must be mentioned that the area under the curve of kaempferol was relatively low (Table S2), which made us discard this molecule as the main molecule responsible of the inhibitory activity observed in vitro. | The docking results (Figure S3) showed that most of these compounds had multiple πalkyl interactions with the same residues: for selina-3,7(11)-diene, with the amino acids LEU565, LEU773, ALA561, HIS523, ILE572, HIS518, VAL769, ILE770, PHE576, and TRP519; for guaiol acetate, with the amino acids LEU565, LEU773, ALA561, HIS523, ILE572, HIS518, HIS513, VAL566, and ILE557 (together with πσ interactions with TRP519); and for α-cyperone, with the amino acids LEU565, LEU773, ILE572, HIS518, VAL769, PHE576, and LEU 515. | Many of these interactions have already been described for other natural compounds, such as coumarin derivatives and flavonoids . | Overall, the molecular docking results suggested sesquiterpenes, especially selina-3,7(11)-diene, guaiol acetate, α-cyperone, and farnesyl acetate, as compounds with promising neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory capacity. | Conclusions In the present work, a green extraction method based on PLE was optimized to obtain bioactive compounds from F. | aerial parts and roots, together with an in vitro neuroprotective evaluation and a comprehensive chemical characterization. | Furthermore, the extensive chemical characterization highlighted the complex and diverse composition of all of the extracts, indicating that non-polar solvents increased the extraction of specific subclasses of compounds, such as hydroxycoumarins, flavones, methoxyphenols, monoterpenoids, O-methylated flavonoids, and sesquiterpenoids, independently of the plant material used. | Among them, several flavonoids and sesquiterpenoids have already been reported as good antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective molecules (as those identified in the present work), which combined could explain the in vitro neuroprotective activity observed. | Nonetheless, this high complexity also makes the absolute quantification of all molecules difficult and hampers the undoubted determination of the responsible compounds, as synergistic effects might occur. | To solve these limitations, future work will be directed to absolutely quantifying the most promising compounds in these extracts, to evaluating their neuroprotective capacity in cell culture models, to investigating their potential to cross the bloodbrain barrier, and to performing advanced molecular dynamics simulations if promising results are obtained.",

      "text_block": "We show that DUB family members regulate key signaling pathways, such as NFκB, PI3KAktmTOR, and MAPK, and play crucial roles in tumorigenesis and other diseases (neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory disorders, and developmental diseases), making them promising therapeutic targets Our review also discusses the challenges in developing DUB inhibitors and underscores the critical role of the DUBs in cellular signaling and cancer. | As research has progressed, the critical role of the DUBs in oncology has also gained significant attention, leading to the gradual development of small molecule modulators targeting DUB proteins. | This comprehensive review aims to provide valuable insights into the development of selective DUB inhibitors and their potential clinical applications in targeted therapy and immunomodulation, thereby contributing to future research directions in this field. | For example, USP30 is ubiquitinated by Parkin that promotes the its degradation through the proteasome pathway, thereby enhancing mitophagy by removing the inhibitory effect of USP30 on this process. | Early studies have shown that some DUBs form inhibitory complexes with other proteins, thereby reducing their activity. | For example, the inhibitory complex formed by OTUB1 with charged E2Ub thioesters and free ubiquitin can inhibit OTUB1s DUB activity. | The inhibitory effect of these interactions provides a potential pathway for developing new DUB inhibitors. | 2.3.3 Allosteric regulation Allosteric regulation is another mechanism that modulates the activity of the DUB, involving changes in the threedimensional structure of proteins induced by molecular chaperones, intracellular small molecules, or other proteins. | 84 Moreover, USP8 and OTUD7B (Cezanne1) modulate the EGFR signaling axis, a significant upstream activator of the ERK pathway. | OTUD5 stabilizes RNF186, which promotes the degradation of the mTORC1 feedback inhibitor sestrin2, thereby activating mTOR signaling. | Additionally, OTUD5 modulates the protein abundance of DEPTOR, an inhibitory subunit of both mTORC1 and mTORC2. | DUBs such as USP5 and USP9X directly interact with βcatenin to remove inhibitory ubiquitin chains, thereby stabilizing βcatenin. | Future research focused on the development of DUB inhibitors or modulators holds promise for more effective cancer treatments. | 3.5 Hippo signaling pathway The Hippo signaling pathway is a critical regulator of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and organ size, with its core components, including the MST12 kinases, LATS12 kinases, and the transcription coactivators YAPTAZ. | The function of DUBs in cancer is complex, as they can promote tumor development in certain contexts while exhibiting inhibitory effects in others. | 325 The OTU family members, particularly OTUD7B and OTUD7A, exhibit inhibitory effects on HCC. | Additionally, understanding the structural basis for their dual functions could aid in developing selective inhibitors or activators, leading to innovative, precise cancer therapies and overcoming current treatment challenges. | 345 Similarly, USP13 interacts with and stabilizes Mcl1, and its inhibition reduces Mcl1 levels, increasing the sensitivity of tumor cells to BH3 mimetic inhibitors. | In Lewis lung carcinoma models, USP7 inhibitor treatment reduced tumor growth and enhanced M1 macrophage and CD8 T cell infiltration via the p38 MAPK pathway. | Notably, Usp12s neuroprotective and autophagyinducing effects do not depend on its catalytic activity, highlighting its unique role in regulating neuronal proteostasis. | 369 USP14 inhibitor have been developed as a potential therapeutic agent to protect cells from neurodegenerative stressors cell by enhancing proteasome activity and promoting the degradation of proteotoxic proteins. | 370 , 371 Furthermore, a broader role of USP14 in memory formation and neuroprotection against ischemic injury, highlighting it as a promising therapeutic target in neurodegenerative disorders. | 372 , 373 A recent study reports that loss of USP30 enhances mitophagy and reduces neurodegeneration by counteracting αsynucleins effects, and a USP30 inhibitor MTX115325 shows potential as a diseasemodifying therapy for PD. | 376 , 377 , 378 These results suggest that targeting mutated ATXN3 could offer a promising therapeutic strategy for SCA3, highlighting the need to develop effective ATXN3 inhibitors. | Beyond αsynuclein regulation, UCHL1 interacts with and stabilizes TrkB, a neurotrophin receptor critical for neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity, highlighting a mechanism where UCHL1 modulates BDNFTrkB signaling by preventing TrkB degradation. | 382 These findings underscore the multifaceted role of UCHL1 in neuroprotection and its potential as a therapeutic target in neurodegenerative disorders. | However, developing effective inhibitors for DUBs present multiple challenges, including their high homology, complex threedimensional structures, dynamic conformational changes, and regulation by posttranslational modifications and protein interactions. | Despite these challenges, researchers have successfully identified potential inhibitors targeting specific DUBs through computeraided design and virtual screening techniques (Table 2). | TABLE 2 DUB smallmolecule inhibitors. | 6.1 Targeting USPs As research on the critical roles of the USP family in diseases increases, the discovery of small molecule drugs targeting the USP family has also been burgeoning. | Existing studies have provided detailed reviews of the various small molecule inhibitors currently targeting the USP family. | 24 , 464 , 465 To provide the latest updates, this section will summarize some of the newly emerged USP inhibitors in the past 3 years, focusing on their development strategies and pharmacological activities (Table 2). | The development strategy for USP1 inhibitors involved designing and synthesizing a series of pyridopyrimidin7(8H)one derivatives based on the structure of known inhibitors, with systematic exploration of their structureactivity relationships. | Compound 1m showed strong antiproliferative effects, arrested cancer cells in the S phase, acted as reversible and noncompetitive inhibitors, and enhanced the efficacy of the PARP inhibitor olaparib, demonstrating excellent oral pharmacokinetic properties in mice. | 429 ML323 is a USP1 inhibitor that shows specifically antagonizing the USP1UAF1 complex without affecting other DUBs. Recently, ML323 effectively suppressed the proliferation of HCC and ESCC cells, inhibited TGFβ induced EMT in TNBC cells, and induced apoptosis and DNA damage in ESCC cells, demonstrating its potential as a viable anticancer treatment. | 430 Through a scaffold hopping strategy to enhance the cellular activity of FT671 (known USP7 inhibitor), resulting in the discovery of YCH2823 as a novel and potent USP7 inhibitors. | YCH2823 demonstrated potent inhibition of USP7, inhibiting cancer cell growth, promoting G1 phase arrest and apoptosis, increasing p53 and p21 levels, and showing synergistic effects with mTOR inhibitors, making it a promising anticancer agent for both TP53 wildtype and mutant tumors. | 432 Recently, a series of pyrrolepyrimidin4one derivatives were designed for USP7 inhibition, with the representative compound Z33 (YCH3124) showing high potency and selectivity. | 433 Moreover, a series of 2aminopyridine derivatives were designed and synthesized based on structural modifications of the lead USP7 inhibitor, GNE6640. | 434 Furthermore, the proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) strategy was employed to discovery small molecule to degrade USP7 for inhibiting its function. | Among the synthesized compounds, PROTAC 17 exhibited the most potent USP7 inhibition with an IC50 value of 1.7 µM, aligning with docking results and cell viability profiles, indicating its potential efficacy. | 435 A novel compound D1 with quinolin4(1H)one scaffold was identified as a lead USP10 inhibitor due to its high potency and selectivity. | 436 Spautin1 has been reported as an inhibitor of USP10 and USP13, significantly reducing the proliferation and migration of glioblastoma cells. | 438 Though highthroughput screening and structurebased optimization, BAY805 was developed as a highly potent and selective noncovalent USP21 inhibitor. | 439 Utilizing predictive models to screen and identify potential compounds from the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA)approved drug library, nifuroxazide was identified as the most potent USP21 inhibitor with an IC50 of 14.9 µM. | 441 Recently, identifying a traditional Chinese secoiridoid compound, gentiopicroside, was identified as a USP22 inhibitor by stably binding to the USP22 catalytic pocket. | 442 USP25 and USP28, which are highly homologous and associated with diseases like cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, have recently become focal points for the development of therapeutic inhibitors. | 466 , 467 Through screening a synthetic compound library and further structure optimization, CT1113 was synthesized and developed as a promising USP inhibitor with potent activity against USP28 and USP25. | 444 Given the similar conserved catalytic domain structures in the USP family, different USP targeted inhibitors can also serve as a starting point for ligand design. | The study of the biochemical and structural characteristics of USP47 reveals why the USP7 inhibitor derivative P50429 has targeting and inhibitory abilities toward USP47, and provides new insights for further design of USP47 specific inhibitors. | 445 To develop USP48 inhibitors, 14 commercially available USP inhibitors were screened and ML364 (known as a USP2 inhibitor) was identified as a candidate for further optimization. | Using a ligandbased approach, a series of ML364 analogs were synthesized, with compound 17e showing an IC50 of 12.6 µM in inhibiting USP48 activity. | Further structural refinements are necessary to enhance the inhibition activity and specificity of these compounds. | 446 6.2 Targeting OTUs Recent advancements in OTU deubiquitinase inhibitors have opened new avenues for targeted cancer therapy by modulating deubiquitination processes to suppress tumor growth. | Studies have reported that various smallmolecule compounds, such as SJB3019A, OTUB2IN1, and OTUDin3, exhibit significant inhibitory effects on deubiquitinases along with notable antitumor activities. | This section primarily explores the screening processes, structural optimization, and application potential of several representative OTU deubiquitinase inhibitors across different tumor models, underscoring the importance of further studies to enhance drug selectivity and safety. | Screening was conducted on 20 reported databases of DUB or DUBlike protease inhibitors, and two USP1like inhibitors, SJB2043 and SJB3019A, were found to exhibit significant inhibitory effects on OTUB1 and USP8 at a concentration of 2.5 µM. | To further explore the potential of these inhibitors, indepth structureactivity relationship studies were conducted. | Four analogues, compounds 60, 61, 62, and 63, were developed by modifying the 2phenyl ring of SJB2043 with single substitution, double substitution, and phenyl ring modification. | Subsequently, protein thermal stability and enzyme activity experiments of compound 61 on OTUB1, as well as molecular docking mechanism analysis, showed that compound 61 has high selectivity and strong inhibitory effects on OTUB1 and USP8. | This compound not only demonstrated strong inhibitory effects on OTUB1 and USP8 in vitro but also showed significant antiproliferative effects in H1975 and A549 NSCLC cell lines. | Additionally, compound 61 effectively inhibited tumor growth in the H1975 xenograft mouse model after lowdose intraperitoneal administration. | However, despite the significant antitumor activity exhibited by compound 61, studies also found that the OTUB1USP8 protein exhibits instability when bound to compound 61. | This discovery suggests that further validation of the binding mode of inhibitors is needed in the future, and their efficacy and safety should be evaluated in other animal models. | In particular, indepth studies of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacological properties of compound 61, as well as its mechanisms of action in different tumor types, will help optimize its structure, improving its stability and selectivity. | 447 As the first effective OTUB2 inhibitor, OTUB2IN1 forms hydrogen bonds between its two carboxyl groups and four amino acid residues (Thr45, Gly49, Ser223, and His224) in the OTUB2 catalytic pocket, significantly inhibiting the hydrolysis activity of the recombinant GSTOTUB2 protein toward substrate UbR110. | 448 In the study of OTUD3, computeraided virtual screening and biological experiments identified two OTUD3 inhibitors, OTUDin3 and Rolapitant, which inhibit the deubiquitinase activity of OTUD3. | These research findings further confirm the effectiveness of strategies to influence tumor growth and cell death by regulating specific DUBs. 449 , 450 Additionally, effective inhibitors 7Ai and 7Bi targeting OTUD7A and OTUD7B were discovered using AtomNet virtual screening technology. | Using the generated structures, 4 million compounds were screened, and based on their ability to reduce the abundance of EWSFLI1 protein in A673 and SKNMC cells, it was found that 7Ai can effectively block OTUD7Amediated deubiquitination of EWSFLI1 without affecting the binding of OTUD7A to EWSFLI1. | Similarly, 10 candidate compounds for OTUD7B inhibitors were screened through AtomNet technology and biological experiments. | Subsequently, the inhibitory effects of these compounds on Akt pS473 signaling in various NSCLC cell lines were investigated, and OTUD7B deubiquitinase activity was measured in vitro using K11linked dimeric ubiquitin (diub) as a substrate. | Finally, the study found that compound 7Bi specifically inhibits OTUD7B and inhibits the growth of various NSCLC cells, including A549, in vitro. | The discovery of 7Ai and 7Bi inhibitors indicates that AtomNet has significant potential in discovering different inhibitors of closely related deubiquitinase members. | 451 , 452 Although there is limited research on the role of TRABID in tumors, computer screening of crystal structures based on the A20 OTU domain, searching for compounds that may bind to TRABID catalytic sites, combined with preliminary biological experiments, identified NSC112200 and NSC267309 as TRABID inhibitors with IC50 values of approximately 3 µM. | At a concentration of 20 µM, these two compounds not only inhibited the growth of colorectal tumor cell lines HCT116 and SW480 but also inhibited the growth of two abnormal cell lines, NIH3T3 and HEK293. | 454 conducted a more indepth study on the mechanism of action of the inhibitor NSC112200. | However, the inhibitor exhibits certain toxicity in mice, so its structure needs further optimization. | 454 These studies indicate that NSC112200 and NSC267309 have significant antitumor potential as TRABID inhibitors. | Further optimizing the structure of these inhibitors not only helps to improve their selectivity and safety but also provides important theoretical and experimental bases for the development of newgeneration TRABID inhibitors. | To accelerate the discovery of OTU family inhibitors, an efficient screening platform was established by designing a chemical library based on the chemical types of various DUB inhibitors and combining it with activitybased protein mass spectrometry analysis. | Through this platform, the inhibitor of VCPIP1, the fluoroquinolone compound CAS12290201, was successfully screened. | This compound exhibits high selectivity and strong inhibitory effect on VCPIP1, with an enzymatic IC50 value of 70 nM. | This study demonstrates the feasibility of developing DUB inhibitors through structureguided methods. | Specifically, the successful application of this virtual platform demonstrates that activitybased protein mass spectrometry analysis and welldesigned chemical libraries can effectively screen and optimize DUB inhibitors. | This method not only improves screening efficiency but also significantly enhances the specificity and efficacy of inhibitors, providing important references and tools for future drugdevelopment. | 455 In addition to developing inhibitors that directly interact with catalytic site domains, a novel strategy for creating heterobifunctional chimeric molecules targeting DUBs has recently been proposed, known as DUBTAC technology. | For instance, a recently developed covalent small molecule ligand for OTUB1, acrylamide EN523, can specifically target the noncatalytic allosteric Cys C23 on OTUB1 and effectively bind to OTUB1 within cells. | 6.3 Targeting other DUBs Significant advancements in the development of DUB inhibitors have expanded the scope beyond the wellstudied USP and OTU families, leading to the discovery of potent and selective inhibitors targeting other DUB family members. | This section highlights key compounds such as GK13S, a selective inhibitor of UCHL1, VLX1570 targeting USP14 and UCHL5, and the Rpn11 inhibitor capzimin. | These inhibitors showcase high potency and specificity, serving as essential tools for biochemical research and potential therapeutic applications. | One notable example is the UCHL1targeted inhibitor GK13S. | This inhibitor covalently attaches to the C90 residue via its cyanamide warhead and occupies the enzymes catalytic cleft. | 456 Furthermore, VLX1570, a dual inhibitor of USP14 and UCHL5, was developed from bAP15. | Although VLX1570 is the first DUB inhibitor to enter clinical trials, the study was terminated due to doselimiting toxicities observed at higher doses. | 460 Another significant discovery is iBAP, a selective inhibitor of BAP1, with an IC50 value of 253 nM. | This inhibitor exhibits high specificity for BAP1 over other DUBs. Research shows that leukemia cells harboring truncated ASXL1 gainoffunction mutations, such as K562 cells and THP1 cells, are particularly sensitive to iBAP treatment. | Utilizing a specialized highthroughput screening platform, CSN5i3 emerged as a highly potent inhibitor. | In tests on 500 diverse cancer cell lines, CSN5i3 showed a range of inhibitory activities and significantly suppressed the growth of human xenografts in mouse models. | 463 Recent progress in developing inhibitors for various DUBs beyond the USP and OTU families underscores significant advancements in this field. | These inhibitors not only enhance our understanding of DUBrelated cellular mechanisms but also offer promising prospects for treating cancers and other diseases associated with dysregulated ubiquitination pathways. | Continued research in this area is likely to yield even more potent and specific inhibitors with broad therapeutic potential. | Although significant progress has been achieved in developing inhibitors for the entire DUB family, substantial challenges persist in this area of research. | A major obstacle is the identification of potent compounds that selectively target the catalytic pocket of DUBs. Furthermore, the dynamic alternation between active and inactive conformations of DUBs complicates the design of predictive biochemical assays and the development of druglike compounds. | Additionally, the ubiquitin transfer mediated by reactive thiols in DUBs presents difficulties in the screening of inhibitors. | These challenges have limited the advancement of DUB inhibitors, with only a few making preliminary progress in clinical trials for cancer treatment. | Mitoxantrone, approved by the US FDA as a USP11 inhibitor, is undergoing numerous phase III trials targeting conditions including neoplasms, acute myeloid leukemia, MS, and breast cancer. | To advance DUB inhibitors toward clinical application, future research should pivot toward gaining deeper biological insights. | While traditional methods involve screening known libraries and identifying hit compounds, a shift is needed toward confirming target engagement in cellular and in vivo models through biomarker studies, gene knockout phenotypes, and competitive binding assays. | Chemical proteomics is indispensable in uncovering novel DUB functions and substrate interactions, capitalizing on the unique adaptability, dose responsiveness, and selectivity of small molecules. | By identifying the specific pathogenesis associated with different DUBs, researchers can design small molecule inhibitors or activators tailored to precisely modulate deubiquitination activities. | Additionally, developing selective inhibitors or activators that target specific DUB members could offer more precise and effective cancer therapies. | The development of small molecule inhibitors targeting DUBs faces significant challenges due to the highly conserved catalytic domains of each subfamily and complex regulatory mechanisms. | These factors make achieving specificity and selectivity in inhibitors particularly difficult. | Despite the identification of several inhibitors for OTUs like OTUB1, OTUB2, OTUD7B, and TRABID, challenges related to activity, selectivity, pharmacokinetics, and safety persist, leading to suboptimal drug performance. | These tools facilitate virtual screening and optimization of candidate drugs and enable precise prediction of protein structures, aiding in the design of small molecules that accurately target DUBs. Additionally, the therapeutic potential of DUB activators should not be overlooked. | Some DUBs exhibit tumor suppressive functions, and developing small molecule activators that enhance the catalytic activity or stability of these tumor suppressive DUBs may provide a novel approach for cancer treatment. | Designing PROTACs for selective degradation of OTUs offers the possibility of achieving more effective and sustained inhibition of their carcinogenic activity, potentially overcoming compensatory mechanisms commonly found in traditional inhibitors. | For example, the covalent small molecule ligand acrylamide EN523 of OTUB1 is the first developed DUBTAC and holds significant promise. | 468 By covalently binding small molecule ligands, it does not affect the deubiquitination activity of OTUB1, demonstrating the potential role and application prospects of DUBTAC technology in the future development of OTUtargeted drugs. | In conclusion, while the development of small molecules targeting DUBs presents several challenges, the integration of AI technologies and novel approaches like PROTACs and DUBTACs provide promising strategies. | Additionally, we explore the dual role of DUBs members in tumorigenesis, functioning as both tumor inhibitors and oncogenes in different types of cancer. | Importantly, we summarize current and emerging treatment strategies targeting the DUBs, including small molecule inhibitors, PROTACs, DUBTACs, and potential combination therapies.",

      "text_block": "Our previous research highlighted the neuroprotective effects of the phytoestrogen calycosin on CIRI, although the precise mechanism remains unclear. | Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that calycosin effectively downregulates HMGB1 and TLR4 expression, decreases NF-κB and IκB phosphorylation, and reduces the secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-18.ConclusionThese findings suggest that calycosin mitigates cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury and neuroinflammation by inhibiting the HMGB1TLR4NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby providing neuroprotection. | There has been an increasing interest in natural products with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties to alleviate cerebral IR injury.1719 Phytoestrogens are nonsteroidal polyphenolic natural products found in certain medicinal plants that structurally resemble 17-β-estradiol, a primary member of the estrogen family of female sex hormones. | These compounds can bind to estrogen receptors, exerting biological effects via genomic as well as non-genomic mechanisms.20 Research has indicated that both estrogens and phytoestrogens may positively influence brain function.21 The administration of phytoestrogens or estrogen replacement therapy has been shown to enhance cognitive function, delay the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease, and provide neuroprotection.2224 Calycosin is a bioactive isoflavone phytoestrogen extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine Astragalus membranaceus.25 Owing to its molecular structure similar to estrogen, calycosin has estrogenic and anti-estrogenic effects, and recent studies have shown that it also has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties.26,27 In our previous studies, calycosin prevented ischemic brain injury in rats by inhibiting neuronal autophagy, apoptosis, and inflammatory processes.28,29 However, the therapeutic potential of calycosin and its ability to regulate HMGB1TLR4NF-κB signaling pathway activity in cerebral ischemiareperfusion injury remain unclear. | In this study, we examined the effects of therapeutic administration of calycosin against cerebral ischemiareperfusion injury in rats, and further investigated its neuroprotective mechanisms based on the HMGB1TLR4NF-κB signaling pathway. | Calycosin Reduced Cerebral Infarction Volumes in the MCAO Model Rats TTC staining was used to determine the degree of brain damage and investigate the neuroprotective effects of calycosin in MCAO model rats. | As depicted in Figure 3B, quantitative analysis revealed that the infarct volume in the MCAO model group was 29.4. Calycosin treatment significantly decreased the infarct volume, with reductions to 14, 10, and 4 in the low-dose (5 mgkg), medium-dose (10 mgkg), and high-dose (20 mgkg) groups, respectively, indicating a pronounced neuroprotective effect.Figure 3Effects of calycosin on infarct volume in rats with cerebral ischemiareperfusion injury. | Calycosin Attenuates OGDR-Induced Neuronal Injury in PC12 Cells and Primary Neurons To further assess the neuroprotective properties of calycosin against cerebral ischemiareperfusion injury, a series of in vitro experiments was conducted using PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons. | These results indicated that calycosin possesses neuroprotective properties in PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons following OGDR treatment. | To further investigate the neuroprotective mechanisms of calycosin, we used ELISA and Western blotting to assess the expression of HMGB1, TLR4, and NF-κB in PC12 cells following LPS stimulation and calycosin pretreatment. | These results suggest that calycosin may play a neuroprotective role in cerebral ischemiareperfusion injury by inhibiting the activation of the HMGB1TLR4NF-κB signaling pathway and alleviating the inflammatory response. | The interaction between HMGB1 and TLR4 promotes dissociation of the NF-κBIκB heterodimer in the cytoplasm, leading to nuclear translocation of NF-κB, thus enhancing the expression of downstream proinflammatory cytokines.55 These cytokines possess the ability to not only attract additional immune cells from the peripheral circulation system to the CNS, thereby exacerbating the progression of neuroinflammation but also prompt microglia and macrophages to actively secrete HMGB1.56 It has been reported that NF-κB plays an essential role in the acute phase of cerebral ischemia, as evidenced by its rapid increase in transcriptional activity following cerebral ischemia.57 Notably, studies involving NF-κB (p50) knockout mice or treatment with an NF-κB inhibitor have shown a reduction in ischemic damage after a permanent focal insult.58 In our study, the expression of HMGB1 and TLR4 was significantly increased in the MCAO rat brain tissue and OGDR primary neurons. | Calycosin is a natural compound with various pharmacological activities, which have been extensively investigated. | Numerous reports have confirmed its potential in the prevention and treatment of tumors, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, and other diseases.26,59 Notably, the protective effect of calycosin against ischemic stroke has received much attention, with its neuroprotective mechanisms being multifaceted. | It has been reported that calycosin can alleviate neurological deficits and brain infarction in rats following cerebral ischemiareperfusion, through its antioxidant properties.60 Guo et al demonstrated that calycosin exhibits neuroprotective effects in MCAO rats and OGDR primary neurons by upregulating TRPC6 expression and CREB phosphorylation as well as by inhibiting calpain activation.61 Additionally, a recent study by Xu et al revealed that calycosin inhibits autophagy by regulating the STAT3FOXO3a signaling pathway, thereby ameliorating cerebral ischemiareperfusion injury.62 Furthermore, Liu et al reported that calycosin exhibited a protective effect against cerebral ischemic damage by suppressing ACSL4-dependent ferroptosis.63 Our recent study also indicated that calycosin inhibits activation of the HMGB1TLR4NF-κB signaling pathway and proinflammatory depolarization in microglia subjected to OGDR.35 In this study, we further demonstrated that the neuroprotective effect of calycosin on cerebral ischemiareperfusion injury is associated with the suppression of the inflammatory response mediated by the HMGB1TLR4NF-κB signaling pathway, both in vivo and at the neuronal level. | First, although we propose that calycosin may exert neuroprotective effects by inhibiting the HMGB1TLR4NF-κB signaling pathway, evidence supporting this mechanism remains inconclusive. | Further studies employing specific inhibitors, gene knockout techniques, or siRNA interference are necessary to comprehensively elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. | Conclusion In conclusion, our findings suggest that calycosin post-conditioning can alleviate cerebral ischemiareperfusion injury and that its neuroprotective effects are exerted through the inhibition of HMGB1TLR4NF-κB pathway signaling.",

      "text_block": "The exploration of natural compounds as potential therapeutic agents has gained increasing attention in recent years owing to their wide range of pharmacological activities and minimal side effects. | Overall, BAI and BE exhibit promising potential as natural compounds with anti-inflammatory properties and offer innovative therapeutic approaches for managing NDDs. 1 Introduction Scutellaria baicalensis (S. | Baicalin (BAI; syn.baicalein7-O-β-D-glucuronic acid) and baicalein (BE; 5, 6, 7-trihydroxyflavone), the principal compounds derived from the roots of S. | Moreover, BAI and BE have been investigated for their neuroprotective properties. | They may offer neuroprotection through mechanisms such as reducing neuronal apoptosis, suppressing neuroinflammation, and promoting neuronal regeneration (Yuan et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2024; Song et al., 2024). | Generally, the M1 phenotype is associated with pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic responses, whereas the M2 phenotype predominantly possesses anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective functions (Woodburn et al., 2021). | FIGURE 1 Plausible molecular mechanisms of BAI and BE in NDDs. 4.1 NF-κB signaling Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), implicated in anti-inflammatory processes across various neurodegenerative conditions, typically resides in the cytoplasm bound to the regulatory protein inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) (Sivandzade et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2024). | BAI or BE mediates anti-inflammatory effects by blocking NF-κB activation through multiple signal transductions such as Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), ultimately exerting neuroprotective effects in NDDs. 4.2 TLR4 signaling The TLR4 pathway has been implicated in neuroinflammation, which is a common manifestation of various CNS diseases (Adhikarla et al., 2021; Heidari et al., 2022). | BE reduced the protein levels of TLR4, p-IκBα, and p-p65 in activated microglial models, hindering the translocation of NF-κB p65 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and suppressing the expression of phosphorylated signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1), which also contribute to the shift in microglial polarization toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype (Ran et al., 2021). | In addition, BAI attenuates neurological damage following OGDreperfusion by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activity through enhanced AMPK phosphorylation (Zheng et al., 2021; Li et al., 2017), while the inhibition of the AMPKNrf2 pathway may also contribute to BEs neuroprotective mechanisms (Yuan et al., 2020) 4.6 Other possible mechanisms The alteration of K ()-Cl () co-transporter and Na-K-2Cl cotransporter-1 expression by BAI affects GABAergic signaling, while the enhancement of heat shock protein expression may also contribute to the neuroprotective mechanisms of BAI (Dai et al., 2013). | The neuroprotective properties of BAI and BE appear to stem from their anti-inflammatory characteristics (Pan et al., 2021) (Table 1). | (2012) SH-SY5Y cells Rotenone BE: 10, 25, 50, or 100 µM Showed neuroprotective effects by antioxidant activity, regulation of mitochondrial function, and anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins. | (2007) SD rats BCCAO HRT (BI is one of the compounds) exerts anti-inflammatory effects via inhibition of p38 MAPK phosphorylation in the hippocampus of BCCAO rats Sohn et al. | Furthermore, BAI and BE have demonstrated notable neuroprotective effects in various animal models of AD. | Other in vitro experiments have demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of BAI in PD. | Numerous animal models have confirmed the neuroprotective effects of BAI against PD. | Moreover, BAI demonstrates neuroprotective effects in MPTP-induced PD mice by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and reducing oxidative stress. | Recent studies have shown that BAI exerts neuroprotective effects against chronic brain ischemia. | Extensive evidence has demonstrated the potent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties of BE and BAI in both in vitro and in vivo models of various NDDs mediated through the activation of multiple signaling pathways. | Despite these challenges, accumulating evidence highlights the value of BAI and BE as promising natural compounds.",

      "text_block": "Immunotherapy and ED In 2000, Hurwitz found that anti-CTLA-4 (a T-cell inhibitory receptor) treatment could reduce the grade of prostate tumors in mice, although this treatment was accompanied by prostatitis and destruction of epithelial cells (85). | There are currently several immunotherapy drugs being studied, including CTLA-4 inhibitors, PD-1PD-L1 inhibitors, and antibody therapies targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). | Emerging treatment strategies for ED Traditional treatment methods for ED include psychosocial intervention, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE-5is), intracavernous injection of alprostadil, vacuum erection devices (VEDs), testosterone replacement therapy, and prosthesis implantation, but each of these methods has limitations and complications. | According to research on animals, LIPUS can increase the amount of smooth muscle cells, stimulate the growth of Schwann cells, encourage peripheral nerve regeneration, and increase the expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in the cavernous and dorsal penile nerves, the expression of neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and ICP (129-133). | A substantial body of research currently indicates that the combination of LIPUS with tadalafil therapy is more effective in improving EF than the use of PDE-5 inhibitors alone (134,135). | The outcomes of the experiment demonstrated that BM-MSCs could upregulate the production of VEGF, nerve growth factor, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF); protect nerve growth factor-positive nerve fibers; and raise the level of nNOS (142). | Sauzeau and Sopkos respective studies indicated that Y-27632 (ROCK-1 inhibitor) can upregulate the expression of nNOS and endothelial NOS in the penis of CNIED rats, inhibit the apoptosis of nNOS-positive axons, and help protect the EF of rats (160,161).",

      "title": "Conjugates of amiridine and salicylic derivatives as promising multifunctional CNS agents for potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease",
      "text_block": "Conjugates were mixedtype reversible inhibitors of both cholinesterases and displaced propidium from the AChE peripheral anionic site (PAS) at the level of donepezil. | 6 , 8 , 9 Thus, for AD treatment, the use of an anticholinesterase compound as one of the pharmacophores is a commonly employed approach. | 1 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 The range of pharmacological activities of a parent anticholinesterase compound can be expanded by adding properties that can result in neuroprotection or disease modification, such as the prevention of protein aggregation or oxidative stress. | 9 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 In addition to the widely used anticholinesterase compound tacrine, 12 , 16 , 17 we have extensively applied the amiridine molecule (Figure 1) as an anticholinesterase pharmacophore. | 31 Along with inhibition of cholinesterases, the synthesized conjugates demonstrated antioxidant properties in addition to their ability to inhibit AChEinduced spontaneous and AChEinduced aggregation of βamyloid, thereby showing themselves to be multifunctional agents with potential capacities for disease modification or neuroprotection. | The spectrum of pharmacological activity of the hybrid compounds was provided by both the second pharmacophore and the structure of the spacer. | However, a characteristic feature of the described groups of conjugates was their low inhibitory activity against cholinesterases compared to amiridine itself. | It is known that this moiety possesses an extensive array of desirable bioactive attributes, encompassing abilities to act as antioxidants, metal chelators, and inhibitors of βamyloid aggregation. | These hybrids proved to be effective as cholinesterase inhibitors, antioxidants, chelating agents, and inhibitors of spontaneous and AChEinduced aggregation of βamyloid. | Then compound 2 was heated in POCl3 in the presence of Et3N.HCl to obtain 9chloro2,3,5,6,7,8hexahydro1Hcyclopentaquinoline 3 with an overall yield of 64 (Scheme 1, path 1). | The predominant product in this case was pyridone 2 (58 yield), and the yield of the target compound 3 was only 19 (Scheme 1, path 2). | 37 The methylamine group was introduced under harsh conditions by heating the compound 3 in a 25 (vv) aqueous solution of methylamine at 210C in an autoclave for 18 h with a yield of 97. | 38 , 39 However, in pentanol1 at 160C the substitution of the chlorine atom in compound 3 with the amino group of 1,4diaminobutane 4a, 1,6diaminohexane 4b and 1,8diaminooctane 4c did not proceed, which was apparently due to the lower reactivity of the chlorine atom in derivative 3 compared to the tacrine analog. | Although complete conversion of the starting compound 3 occurred under these conditions, it was accompanied by partial resinification of the mixture that decreased the yield of the target aminoalkylene derivatives 5ac to 5561. | Thus, the acylation of compounds 5ac with salicylic acid chloride 6 in DMF in the presence of Et3N at 65C led to the formation of amiridine conjugates with salicylamide 7ac. | The signals corresponding to the proton and carbon atom of the imine group of compounds 9ac were characteristic at δ 8.3 ppm in the 1H NMR spectra and at 164.46164.99 in the 13C NMR spectra. | In addition, Nhexyl2,3,5,6,7,8hexahydro1Hcyclopentaquinolin9amine 11, Nhexylsalicylimine 12, and Nhexylsalicylamine 13 were obtained as model compounds. | One more model compound, Nhexylsalicylamide 14, was prepared and studied in our previous work. | 16 Substitution of the chlorine atom in compound 3 with Nhexylamine under the reaction conditions with diamines 4 allowed us to obtain the Nhexyl derivative of amiridine 11. | 40 , 41 , 42 Amiridine and Nhexylamiridine 11 were used as reference compounds. | Bis4nitrophenyl phosphate (BNPP), a selective CES inhibitor, was used as a positive control. | Table 2 Esterase profiles of the compounds, their ability to displace propidium from the PAS of Electrophorus electricus AChE (EeAChE), and their inhibition of Aβ42 selfaggregation. | b For active compounds (inhibition at 20 μM 30), AChE and BChE inhibition is presented as IC50 SEM μM, n 3. | c Propidium displacement from the EeAChE PAS at 20 µM compound concentration. | d Inhibition of Aβ42 (50 µM) selfaggregation by the tested compound at 100 µM concentration. | Furthermore, like amiridine, the compounds were more selective toward BChE. | All compounds rather weakly inhibited the offtarget CES. | This compound inhibited BChE with IC50 11.1 0.1 nM, which is 25 times more effective than amiridine and close to the inhibitor activity of its tacrine analog (IC50 10.4 1.3 nM). | The lead compound, salicylamine derivative 10c, had an IC50 (AChE) value of 0.265 0.018 μM. | The results obtained, along with the close inhibitory activity of the model compound Nhexylamiridine 11 and amiridine (Table 2), support our hypothesis that an alkylene spacer would enhance the anticholinesterase activity of the conjugates. | In contrast, model compounds 1214, Nhexyl derivatives of the second salicylic pharmacophore, showed no significant anticholinesterase activity. | 2.2.2 Kinetic studies of AChE and BChE inhibition The mechanism of inhibition of AChE and BChE by the conjugates was studied using compounds 7b, 9b, and 10b. | Figure 3 shows LineweaverBurk plots of the enzyme kinetics results, taking compound 10b as a representative example. | The values obtained for the competitive (K i) and noncompetitive (αK i) components of the constants for AChE and BChE inhibition by compounds 7b, 9b, and 10b are listed in Table 3. | Figure 3 Steadystate inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) (a) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) (b) by compound 10b. | a Values for K i (competitive inhibition constant) and αK i (noncompetitive inhibition constant) were determined from analyses of slopes of 1V versus 1S at various inhibitor concentrations. | 2.2.3 Displacement of propidium from the PAS of EeAChE To evaluate the synthesized conjugates as potential inhibitors of the proaggregation activity of AChE, we used a fluorescent method to determine the ability of the compounds to competitively displace propidium, a selective ligand of the AChE PAS, responsible for binding to βamyloid. | As can be seen from Table 2, all studied conjugates at a concentration of 20 μM displaced propidium from the EeAChE PAS, reducing the fluorescence intensity at a level (1015) comparable to or slightly higher than the values of the reference compound Donepezil and the original pharmacophore amiridine. | The salicylamide group of compound 7a formed hydrogen bonds with the main chain NHgroup of Phe295 and both with the main chain NHgroup and O atom of Arg296 (Figure 4a). | The similar binding mode of the compounds explains similar propidium displacement efficacy from the AChE PAS for all three conjugates (Table 2). | For compounds 9ac, the salicylimine group was bound differently: compound 9a formed a hydrogen bond with the side chains of residues Tyr124 and Asp74 (Figure 4b), and compounds 9b,c formed hydrogen bonds with the main chain NH groups of Phe295 and Arg296 (Figure 4b). | Figure 4 Results of molecular docking of the considered compounds to AChE: Binding poses with the strongest estimated binding affinity of compounds 7ac (a), 9ac (b), and 10ac (c). | Carbon atoms of compounds with n 4 (suffix a) are colored purple, n 6 (suffix b) are colored green, and n 8 (suffix c) are colored pink. | In addition, compound 10c had the best estimated binding energy to AChE, which also correlated with experimental data (Table 2). | In the case of docking to BChE, as for AChE, the binding modes of compounds 7ac and 9ac were similar and different from compounds 10ac (Figure 5). | The amiridine fragment of compounds 7a and 9a with shorter linkers formed hydrogen bonds between the protonated endocyclic nitrogen atom of amiridine and the Asp70 side chain. | With the increase of the linker length, the exocyclic amino group of amiridine of compounds 7b,c (Figures 5a) and 9b,c (Figure 5b) formed hydrogen bonds with the Asp70 side chain, and the amiridine ring formed ππ stacking interactions with the Tyr332 side chain. | Figure 5 Results of molecular docking of the considered compounds to BChE: Binding poses with the strongest estimated binding affinity of compounds 7ac (a), 9ac (b), and 10ac (c). | Carbon atoms of compounds with n 4 (suffix a) are colored purple, n 6 (suffix b) are colored green, and n 8 (suffix c) are colored pink. | The salicylamine ring of the compound 10a with the shortest linker formed ππ stacking interactions with the Trp82 side chain, while for 10b and 10c, the salicylamine group was bound to the oxyanion hole and interacted with the catalytic residues. | The amiridine fragment of compounds 10b and 10c interacted with Tyr332, forming a hydrogen bond and ππ stacking interactions (Figure 5c), but they were oriented differently compared to compounds 7b,c, and 9b,c (Figure 5a,b). | The results show (Table 2) that the studied compounds at a concentration of 100 μM inhibit the selfaggregation of βamyloid at a level of 2096. | Compounds 7c, 9c, 10c with spacer (CH2)8 exhibited maximum inhibitory activity against Aβ42 (71.796.7), which corresponds to or exceeds the effectiveness of the reference compounds myricetin (79.4 6.3) and propidium iodide (90.7 7.1). | The current docking results also demonstrated that the binding of the studied compounds to the individual Aβ42 conformers differs rather significantly (see Figure 6). | Figure 7 presents the best binding poses for all studied compounds docked to the first conformer of Aβ42. | Figure 6 Interactions of the compounds with soluble forms of Aβ42. | (be) Binding poses of compounds 7a (b), 7c (c), 10a (d), 7c (e) to all 10 conformers of Aβ42. | Thus, all studied compounds preferentially were bound at the Nterminus of the peptide structure. | 47 , 48 With the increase of the linker length, coverage of this domain increased, which is in agreement with the increased antiaggregation potency of the compounds with linker elongation. | a TEACactivity of the compounds relative to Trolox (for calculation, see Section 4). | b IC50concentration of the compound required to reduce the concentration of the ABTS radical by 50. | As can be seen from Table 4, salicylimine derivatives 9ac were quite active in the ABTS test (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity 0.64 0.01), while changing the length of the spacer of conjugates did not affect the activity of compounds. | We observed significant changes when replacing the imine spacer with an amine one (compounds 10ac), whereupon the radicalscavenging activity increased by 2.3 times (TEAC 1.50 0.07). | As for model compounds 1214 based on salicylic derivatives, Nhexylsalicylamine 13 demonstrated the highest radicalscavenging (ABTSscavenging) activity (TEAC 1.52 0.07), equal to the activity of the corresponding conjugates, and a rather high initial rate of the ABTS binding reaction (within 1 min), while its salicylimine analog 12 had a radicalscavenging activity that was 10fold lower (TEAC 0.15 0.008). | 33 Interestingly, the model compounds demonstrated the same range of activities as their conjugates, while the effect of structure changes was more pronounced. | The lead compounds were conjugates of salicylamine 10ac. | Given that in the experiment no dependence of AOA on the spacer length was observed, one compound of each type with the shortest spacer (CH2)4, namely, 7a a , 9a a , 10a as (here subscripts mark protonation states as described above) was taken for calculations. | Quantum chemical calculations showed that the bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) of the OH group agrees with the AOA of the compounds under study (see Table 5). | The lowest BDE value was found for compound 10a as (83.5 kcalmol) with the highest AOA (TEAC 1.5), and the highest BDE value was found for compound 9a a (90.2 kcalmol) with the lowest AOA (TEAC 0.65). | Table 5 Calculated BDE values for the investigated compounds. | It can be assumed that the mechanism of the antiradical action of the studied compounds is Hatom abstraction from the OH group with electron transfer to the ABTS radical and simultaneous proton loss to the solvent (see Figure 8). | 2.2.9 Metalchelating properties UVVis spectroscopy was used to evaluate the ability of compounds to form metal complexes, as shown previously by other groups 50 , 51 and by us. | 16 In the present work, the ability of compounds 7c, 9c, 10c, which belong to three different groups of conjugates, to bind Cu2, Fe2, and Zn2 ions in EtOH solution was studied. | Figure 9 UV spectra of compound 10c and its mixtures with Cu2, Fe2, and Zn2 ions. | Figure 10 UV spectra of the 9cCu2, 11Cu2, and 12Cu2 complexes were obtained by subtracting the spectra of ions and compounds from the spectra of mixtures. | Figure 11 Absorbance of the 10cCu2 complex at 352 nm as a function of the concentration of Cu2 (compounds concentration is 20 µM). | Compound λmax, nm Shift of Absorbance,a nm Cu(II) Zn(II) Fe(II) 7c 286; 228; 205 288; 236 288; 236 288; 236 9c 317; 279; 259; 214 363; 289; 276; 236 287; 236 287; 236 10c 278; 220; 201 288; 236 287; 236 287; 236 11 277; 224 287; 236 287; 236 287; 236 12 400; 316; 254; 215 362; 295; 272; 237 a The shift of absorbance values was calculated by subtraction of the sum of spectra of the compound and the corresponding ion from the spectra of the mixture. | The UV absorption spectra of compounds 7c, 9c, 10c contain two groups of bands. | The ligandmetal ion ratio in the Cu2 complexes was investigated for conjugates 7c, 9c, and 10c by mixing a fixed concentration of the test compound with increasing concentrations of the metal ion (250 µM) 52 (Figure 11 and Supporting Information S1: S51S54). | In the case of the 9cCu2 complex, the ligandmetal ratio was almost 2:1, which may also indicate a difference in the coordination of compound 9c with Cu2 compared to conjugates 7c and 10c (Supporting Information S1: Figure S54b). | Amiridine was included as a reference compound. | 53 , 54 , 55 The IC50 values (concentration of the compound resulting in a 50 decrease in cell viability) are listed in Table 7 and Supporting Information S1: Figures S56S61. | By this criterion, the least toxic compounds across all three cell types were amiridine, 7a, 9a, and 9c, whereas the most toxic compounds were 7c and 10c. | Within each cell type, compound 7a with a (CH2)4 spacer was less toxic than compound 7c with a (CH2)8 spacer. | The apparent trend of increasing cytotoxicity of the conjugates 7c, 9c, and 10c with spacer (CH2)8 and 7a, 9a, and 10a with spacer (CH2)4 compared with each other and to the reference compound amiridine may be due to the long length of the octamethylene spacer, which increases the lipophilicity of the studied compounds and, consequently, their cytotoxicity. | 56 2.2.11 Prediction of ADMET, physicochemical, and Pan Assay INterference compoundS (PAINS) profiles The results of our computational estimates of selected ADMET and physicochemical properties for compounds 7, 9, and 10 are shown in Table 8. | Most of the compounds had high predicted values for intestinal absorption, enabling their oral administration. | The cardiac toxicity risk parameters (hERG pK i and pIC50) fell within 3.96.0 log units for all the analyzed compounds, which was within the lower and medium parts of their possible range (39 log units). | According to the commonly accepted druglikeness guidelines, the predicted lipophilicities and aqueous solubilities, as well as the molecular weights of the compounds, were within or close to the desirable range for potential drug compounds, although the LogP values in some cases violated the original Ruleof5 limits (however, given that some of the compounds were outside of the model applicability domain, the predicted values were not fully reliable). | The PAINS filter check revealed the mannich_A(296) alert for compounds 10ac. | Table 8 Predicted ADMET and physicochemical profiles of compounds 7, 9, and 10. | Compound MW LogPow pSaq LogBB HIA, hERG pK i hERG pIC 50 QED 7a 379.50 4.06

| The conjugates were mixedtype reversible inhibitors of both cholinesterases and demonstrated dual binding to the catalytic and PASs of AChE in molecular docking, which along with experimental results on propidium displacement suggested their potential to block AChEinduced βamyloid aggregation. | All conjugates were active as inhibitors of Aβ42selfaggregation in the thioflavin test. |

coincided with the literature data. | 4.1.9 Synthesis of 2phenol (13) NaBH4 (0.076 g, 0.002 mol) was added to a solution of compound 12 (0.0005 mol) in ethanol (20 mL). | Initially, we used a single concentration of 20 µM for all compounds. | Subsequently, IC50 values (µM) were determined for the most active compounds against AChE, BChE, and CES. | After a 5 min incubation at 25C (for temperature equilibration) with three increasing concentrations of inhibitor and six decreasing substrate concentrations, the residual enzyme activity was measured as described above for enzymatic assays. | 4.2.2 Propidium displacement studies The ability of the test compounds to competitively displace propidium was evaluated by the fluorescence method, 65 as described in detail in Makhaeva et al. | After 15 min of incubation of the test compounds at a concentration of 20 μM with a 7 μM solution of EeAChE in 1 mM TrisHCl buffer, pH 8.0, 25C, propidium iodide (final concentration 8 μM) was added. | Donepezil and amiridine were the reference compounds. | 4.2.3 Inhibition of βamyloid (142) (Aβ42) selfaggregation Inhibition of Aβ42 selfaggregation by test compounds was studied using the ThT fluorescence method 67 , 68 with minor modifications as described in detail in Makhaeva et al. | The samples of 50 μM Aβ42 in 215 mM Naphosphate buffer pH 8.0 were incubated for 24 h at 37C in the

compoundTrolox. | The IC50 values for the test compounds were also determined. | A total of 10 μL (0.5 mM) of the tested compound or reference compound was mixed with 240 μL of the FRAP reagent, and the absorbance of the mixture was measured spectrophotometrically (λ 593 nm) with a SPECTROStar Nano microplate reader (BMG LabTech) at 593 nm, after a 1 h incubation at 37C against a blank. | Trolox was used as a reference compound. | The AOA was calculated and expressed as Trolox equivalents (TE)the values calculated as the ratio of the concentrations of Trolox and the test compound resulting in the same effect on ferricreducing activity. | Cytotoxicity IC50 values are expressed as mean SEM calculated using GraphPad Prism version 7.00 for Windows from three technical replicates drawn from each of six experiments (two experiments for each of the three cell types with the six test compounds and the amiridine reference compound split between each experiment). | 4.4 Molecular modeling studies 4.4.1 Molecular docking All compounds were optimized by density functional theory (DFT) quantumchemical methods using the B3LYP functional, 631 G basis set and D3 version of Grimmes dispersion correction. | The Mulliken charges from the quantum chemical calculations were assigned to compounds for MD simulations. | For docking with AChE, different grid boxes were chosen: the first included the entire active site gorge of AChE (26 Å 26 Å 26 Å; center x 14.4 Å, y 42.9 Å, z 2.2 Å), the second box corresponded to the CAS (21 Å 21 Å 21 Å; center x 3.0Å y 40.0 Å z 31.0 Å; was used for model compounds M1M5), the third option corresponded to the residues of the PAS (24 Å 24 Å 24 Å; x 17 Å y42 Å z29 Å; was used in M1M5 docking). | 4.4.2 Quantum chemical analysis of AOA The antiradical activity of the studied compounds was assessed on the basis of their energy characteristics calculated by the DFT quantum mechanical modeling method. | 85 Human intestinal absorption (HIA), 86 bloodbrain barrier distributionpermeability (LogBB), 87 , 88 and hERGmediated cardiac toxicity risk (channel affinity pK i and inhibitory activity pIC50) 89 were estimated using the integrated online service for the prediction of ADMET properties. | 4.5.2 Cytotoxicity The determination of the cytotoxic effect of tested compounds using MTT was carried out in accordance with the methods described earlier. | At 24 h after plating, the test compounds that were previously dissolved in DMSO (Molekula Ltd.) were added to the culture medium. | The final concentration of compounds in the incubation

      "text_block": "This study analyzed 150 bioactive phytochemicals from Trachyspermum ammi using structure-based drug design and various in-silico tools to identify potent anti-AChE compounds. | Selected compounds were prepared for molecular docking with the human AChE protein as the receptor. | The hit compounds were further evaluated for drug-likeness using Lipinskis rule and ADMET properties, confirming favorable pharmacokinetic profiles. | This study suggests that these identified compounds could be novel nature-derived AChE inhibitors, potentially contributing to AD treatment. | Future research will focus on developing these compounds into safe and effective drugs to combat Alzheimers disease. | For instance, the tau aggregation inhibitor TRx0237 did not demonstrate therapeutic benefits in phase III trials and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), the only passive vaccine to reach phase III clinical trials, failed to achieve the primary endpoints in patients with mild-to-moderate AD . | Given that defects in cholinergic neurotransmission are linked to AD, cholinesterase inhibitors such as galantamine, donepezil, rivastigmine, and huperzine A have been extensively studied as symptomatic treatments for AD . | Although some organophosphate inhibitors have been used as insecticides and chemical warfare agents due to their irreversible inhibition of AChE, resulting in lethal consequences , other AChE inhibitor-based drugs have been approved by the FDA, including biperiden, memantine, edrophonium, neostigmine, caproctamine, and tacrine . | Therefore, there is a need for safe and effective AChE inhibitors that can halt the progression of the disease at its initial stage, prevent neurodegeneration, or improve cognitive impairment to reduce the social and financial burden of caring for AD patients and enhance their quality of life . | Various plant-based phytoconstituents, including alkaloidal, polyphenolic, and terpenoid compounds, possess excellent therapeutic potential. | ammi seed extract has demonstrated neuroprotective and learningmemory-enhancing properties in several studies . | Consequently, the current study aims to virtually identify potential phytoconstituents as AChE inhibitors from T. | 2.2. First-phase screening based on drug-likeness and bioavailability score A crucial factor to consider while choosing compounds in the early phases of drug development is drug-likeness. | Nevertheless, assessing drug-likeness in absolute terms does not fully capture the range of compound quality. | Worrisomely, commonly used rules may unintentionally encourage unwanted molecular property inflation by allowing rule-compliant compounds to encroach on their bounds. | Weighted quantitative estimate of drug-likeness (QEDw) score was used to filter the druggable compounds from the fresh Excel database in the first place. | QEDw is a drug-ability score for small molecules proposed by Bickerton et al. | Bioavailability is also an important aspect of druggable small molecules. | In this study, we assessed the bioavailability of each compound using swissADME server . | Only the compounds that showed negative outcomes in all sorts of toxicological endpoints and had an oral toxicity class of 4 or higher were chosen for further analysis. | 2.4. Ligand collection, retrieving, and preparation The compounds that met the criteria in first phase screening and toxicity profiling were considered for generating hit compounds. | In this aspect, 3D structures of the compounds were downloaded from the IMPPAT database in mol format. | 2.6. Molecular docking and validation of docking protocol In in silico drug design, molecular docking is a crucial step for screening hit compounds from thousands for a specific target. | Thus, it can be inferred that using the same docking methodology is likely to produce accurate and reproducible conformers for screening the compound library derived from T. | 2.8. Lipinskis rule of five and ADMET determination For the hit compounds along with control ligand, Lipinskis rule and ADMET properties were assessed to predict their drug-ability. | The ADME pharmacokinetic characteristics which are essential for a compound to be a drug, are absent from half of the drug candidates, which lead to their failure in the development process . | The pkCSM web server was used to evaluate each of the compounds ADMET profile . | 2.9.

In silico chemical profiling and compound library Initially, a phytochemical library consisting of 150 bioactive compounds derived from T. | In the preliminary screening phase, compounds that exhibited poor drug-likeness and bioavailability properties were excluded. | From the initial 150 compounds, 102 were selected for further evaluation based on their favorable drug-likeness and bioavailability profiles. | The subsequent toxicity assessment revealed that 67 out of the 102 compounds met safety criteria across various toxicological endpoints, including carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, cytotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and hepatotoxicity. | Furthermore, these 67 compounds were classified within oral toxicity class 4 or higher, indicating their safety for oral administration. | The screening results highlight the importance of choosing compounds with good drug-likeness, bioavailability, and strong safety profiles. | The high toxicity rates among the screened compounds emphasize the need for careful evaluation to select safe and effective candidates for subsequent studies. | 3.2.

Lipinkis rule analysis The rule-of-five, established by Lipinski and colleagues, is a widely recognized guideline used to predict the oral bioavailability of pharmaceutical compounds. | This rule, developed from an analysis of 2,245 drugs that had advanced to Phase II trials, suggests that compounds may face absorption challenges if they meet two or more of the following criteria: (1) Molecular weight (MW) greater than 500 Da, (2) More than 10 hydrogen-bond acceptors (HBA), (3) More than 5 hydrogen-bond donors (HBD), (4) Calculated logP greater than 5.0 (using ClogP) or greater than 4.15 (using MlogP), and (5) More than three rotatable bonds (NBR) . | In this study, the applicability of the rule-of-five was assessed for the hit compounds. | Table 4 presents the results, showing the number of violations for each criterion among the hit compounds compared to standard drugs. | The analysis indicates that while some of the hit compounds conform to the rule-of-five criteria, others exhibit multiple violations. | Comparing these results with those of standard drugs provides insight into the relative drug-likeness of the compounds and their potential for effective oral administration. | This assessment is critical for guiding the selection of compounds for further development, particularly in optimizing their pharmacokinetic properties to enhance their prospects for clinical success. | 10.1371journal.pone.0311401.t004 Table 4 Lipinskis rule of five parameters for the hit compounds. | As shown in Table 5, all the identified hit compounds exhibit high human intestinal absorption (HIA) rates, exceeding 90, with the exception of 2-Methyl-3-glucosyloxy-5-isopropyl phenol, which has a lower absorption rate of 39.61, indicating poor oral absorption. | All the studied compounds were identified as P-glycoprotein inhibitors, which suggests that their absorption will not be hindered by this efflux transporter. | 10.1371journal.pone.0311401.t005 Table 5 ADMET properties of hit compounds with comparison to the reference drug. | Name Absorption Distribution Metabolism Excretion Toxicity HIA C2P P-GpI BBB CYP2C9 TC hERG VIR 92.814 1.483 No 0.632 No 0.817 No PHE 39.610 -0.219 No -0.922 No 0.869 No CUR 93.896 1.555 No 0.599 No 1.511 No STE 96.204 1.492 No 0.716 Yes 0.955 No GAL 94.994 1.594 No -0.081 No 0.991 No HIA Human intestinal absorption (), C2P CACO-2 permeability (log Papp in 106 cms), P-GI P-glyco-protein inhibitor, BBB Blood-brain barrier (log BB), hERG human Ether-a-go-go Related Gene, TC Total Clearance (log mlminkg) In the development of AChE inhibitors, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability is a critical factor, as compounds that cannot cross the BBB will not effectively reach neuronal cells in the brain, thus limiting their efficacy as AChE inhibitors . | Moreover, none of the compounds were predicted to be hERG inhibitors, suggesting that they are unlikely to pose a risk of cardiotoxicity. | In this study, the energy gaps of the identified hit compounds were found to range between 5.98 eV and 8.71 eV, indicating that these compounds are kinetically more stable compared to the reference compound, galantamine, which has a lower energy gap of 4.99 eV (S4 Fig). | For all optimized structures of the hit compounds, as well as the control ligand, the reactive sites for electrophilic and nucleophilic attacks were identified using MEP analysis (S5 Fig). | These findings offer valuable insights into the stability and reactivity of the hit compounds and their potential interactions with the target receptor, providing a basis for further development as effective inhibitors. | In this study, four hit compounds were identified with promising drug-like properties, favorable ADMET and toxicity profiles, and strong binding affinity for the AChE enzyme. | These findings provide a solid foundation for experimentalists to conduct in vitro and in vivo studies to validate the AChE inhibitory potential of Trachyspermum ammi. | If further studies confirm these results, the bioactive compounds from this plant could offer a safe and effective treatment option for Alzheimers disease in clinical settings. | (DOCX) S2 Fig Molecular docking scores of 67 compounds.",

Discussion This study revealed the first-time report on compound isolation ascertained by structure elucidation employing NMR technology from two Colocasia species, namely, C. | These revealed three bioactive flavonoids along with two triterpenoids and one monoglyceride in total, which sheds light on the polyphenol-rich candidacy of these plants, which may result in promising lead compounds for future drug discovery and development. | Dichloromethane fractions of both plants were used in phytochemical screening and isolation of compounds. | A total of four compounds were elucidated from the dichloromethane soluble fraction of C. | The compounds isolated from C. | Another three compounds were isolated from the dichloromethane-soluble fraction of C. | The 1HNMR spectrum (500 MHz, CDCl3) of compounds 1 and 4 (Figure 4) in CDCl3 indicated the presence of three methoxy groups at δH 4.04 (3H, s), δH 4.02 (3H, s), and δH 3.90 (3H, s). | Thus, the structure of compounds 1 and 4 can be concluded as penduletin. | The 1H NMR spectrum (400 MHz, CDCl3) of compound 2 (Figure 5) showed two triplets at δH 5.32 ppm and δH 5.28 ppm characteristic of the olefinic proton (H-12) of α- and β-amyrin, respectively. | The above data identified compound 2 as a mixture of α-amyrin (2a) and β-amyrin (2b) with a ratio of 4:3 based on the 1H NMR peak heights. | The structure of compound 3 can be proposed as a monoglyceride of saturated fatty acid. | Comparing all the spectral data on the structure of compound 3 with the previously documented study (Kavadia et al., 2017) supports identifying this compound as a monoglyceride of stearic acid with the structure drawn in Figure 6. | The 1H NMR spectrum (CDCl3, 500 MHz) of compound 5 (Figure 7) showed two aromatic systems, including one 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring with the doublet at δH 7.68 (2H, d, J 8.5 Hz), one tetra-substituted benzene ring with the 1H signals at δH 6.86 (1H, d, J 8.5 Hz), δH 7.46 (1H, d, J 8.5 Hz), and a 3,3-dimethyl-pyrano group. | Thus, the structure of compound 5 can be proposed as 7, 8-(3,3-dimethyl-pyrano)-4-hydroxy flavonol. | The 1H NMR spectrum (CDCl3, 500 MHz) of compound 6 shows signals that exactly match those of compound 5 (7,8-(3,3-dimethyl-pyrano)-4-hydroxy flavonol). | But the presence of additional peaks suggest the presence of another compound as a mixture. | Thus, the structure of compound 6 appeared as a mixture of 4,7,8-trihydroxy flavonol with 7,8-(3,3-dimethyl-pyrano)-4-hydroxy flavonol (compound 5) in a ratio of 1:2, according to the peak heights in the 1H NMR spectrum. | Interestingly, other compounds, especially a mixture of α- and β- amyrin, also showed noteworthy activity. | A monoester extracted from the plant showed relatively mild analgesic activity compared to other compounds, which invalidates its strong candidacy as a lead compound for further drug development exploration. | Among all the compounds, C5 showed the highest binding affinity with interactions of pi-sigma, alkyl, pi-alkyl, and conventional hydrogen bonds (Table 6; Figure 9 ). | The binding interactions for the other compounds are briefly depicted in Table 6. | These binding interactions in molecular docking are important as they determine the strength and stability of the ligand binding to the target protein, which directly influences the efficacy of a potential drug or inhibitor (Morris and Lim-Wilby, 2008). | µ, κ, and δ are the opioid receptors that modulate the activity of the enteric nervous system and the release of neurotransmitters, thereby influencing both stimulatory and inhibitory motor pathways. | The compound β-amyrin (C2b) exhibited the highest affinity among all the compounds, including alkyl bond interactions with the amino acids Tyr 140, Ile 180, Trp 183, Leu 184, and Ile 191 (Table 5; Figure 10). | The identified compounds were docked against the COX-2 enzyme to investigate the peripheral analgesic properties. | Therefore, COX-2 inhibitors are considered to work in chronic pain relief and post-surgical analgesia by reducing the production of prostaglandins responsible for inflammation, pain, and fever, along with the minimization of gastrointestinal side effects (Camu et al., 2003). | Diclofenac sodium is a well-established COX-2 inhibitor, and it interferes with the production of prostaglandin G2, which is the precursor to other prostaglandins (Kaur and Sanyal, 2011). | The compound β-amyrin (C2b) showed a higher docking score of 8.7 kcalmol than the standard and demonstrated a strong conventional hydrogen bond interaction with the amino acid Asp 347 (Tables 5, 6; Figure 11). | The ADMET study of the identified compounds also exhibited promising results, which are listed in Table 7. | However, the compounds α- and β-amyrin (C2a and C2b) each had two violations, and the monoglyceride of stearic acid (C3) compound had three violations. | The results suggest that the compounds C1C4 and C5 conform to Lipinski standards, signifying their oral safety and potential as promising candidates for medicinal purposes. | pkCSM is a novel approach to predicting pharmacokinetic and toxicological consequences that use graph-based signatures to represent the chemistry and topology of small compounds (Pires et al., 2015). | Table 7 shows that all the test compounds possessed negative water solubility values (log molL), suggesting that they are lipophilic, which promotes effective absorption (Kuentz and Arnold, 2009). | The bioavailability scores of all compounds were found to be 0.55. | None of the identified test compounds exhibited any hepatotoxicity. | Moreover, none of the compounds was found to inhibit hERG I, and except for C2a, C2b, and C5, none of them inhibited hERG II, indicating that these compounds may not be cardiotoxic (Muster et al., 2008). | Finally, from all the hypotheses of the in silico study, the identified compounds that gave promising docking scores with the respective receptors, adhered to Lipinskis rule, and conformed satisfactorily with pharmacokinetic and toxicological assumptions should be considered for their drug candidacy and further investigation. | Compared with existing therapeutic agents, the identified compounds exhibited remarkable effects in bioassays as well as remarkable binding affinities with the corresponding biomolecules. | The present study represents the first-time report on compound isolation from C. | Upon biological investigations, these compounds showed prospective antimicrobial, analgesic, and antidiarrheal potentials, justifying the tribal use of these taro vegetables. | Further extensive scientific research on the isolated compounds in dosage form on a clinical trial basis is highly recommended to ascertain their safety and efficacy profile and mode of action to ease the process of future drug discovery and development.",

      "text_block": "Thus, targeting this pathway could inhibit tumor growth and progression, suggesting that therapies combining CDK46 inhibitors with agents that modulate SMURF2 activity could enhance anti-cancer efficacy (13). | Further, studies demonstrate that CDK46 inhibitors, such as palbociclib, synergize with HSP90 inhibitors to reduce HIF1α levels and suppress cancer cell viability, even in Rb-deficient tumors. | Together, these findings suggest that CDK46 inhibitors may synergize with SMURF2s role in degrading HIF1α, presenting a promising combination strategy to target hypoxic pathways in cancer therapy (28). | Separately, studies on CDK46 inhibitors like palbociclib suggest that these inhibitors can reduce HIF-1α levels through an indirect mechanism, offering a novel approach to destabilizing HIF1α in a VHL-independent manner and potentially enhancing therapeutic outcomes (31). | Recent studies also demonstrate the efficacy of combining CDK46 with HSP-90 inhibitors, further inhibiting HIF1 activity and offering potential treatment enhancements for renal and colon cancers (26). | This synthesis of findings highlights the potential of kinase-targeted strategies and the importance of continued research into CDK inhibitors to combat tumors characterized by active HIF1α. | This approach, combined with the potential of combination therapies involving CDK and HSP-90 inhibitors, could significantly impact cancer progression and drug resistance by stabilizing HIF1α, suggesting a synergistic mechanism that broadens the scope of combating therapy resistance (1, 75). | 8 Heat shock proteins in cancer: modulating the SMURF2-HIF1α axis to overcome resistance Combining cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors with heat shock protein 90 (HSP-90) inhibitors presents a promising approach to destabilizing hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α) and inhibiting cancer cell growth. | HSP-90 emerges as a significant anticancer target (78, 79); however, compensatory induction of HSP-70 following HSP-90 inhibition reduces the efficacy of HSP-90 inhibitors by counteracting their therapeutic impact (79, 80). | The dual inhibition of CDKs and HSP-90 amplifies the reduction of HIF1α levels compared to either inhibitor alone, as this approach disrupts both phosphorylation-dependent stabilization and chaperone-mediated folding of HIF1α. | However, recent studies reveal challenges in HSP-targeted strategies, as Phase I trials combining HSP-90 inhibitor ganetespib with ziv-aflibercept encountered significant toxicity issues while aiming to counter resistance by concurrently targeting HIF1α stabilization and angiogenesis (86). | Research into strategies such as the concurrent inhibition of all HSP-90 paralogs and disruption of HSP90-Cdc37 protein interactions seeks to enhance the anticancer efficacy of HSP-90 inhibitors and mitigate compensatory effects from HSP-70 (87). | 10 Clinical development of HIF1α inhibitors 10.1 Emerging therapeutics targeting HIF1α The crucial role of HIF1α in cancer progression has catalyzed the development of numerous inhibitors targeting its various functions, which are currently under investigation in pre-clinical and clinical stages. | These inhibitors disrupt HIF1αs mRNA expression, protein synthesis, stabilization, dimerization with HIF1β, DNA binding, and transcriptional activity ( Figure 2 ). | Notably, MO-460, a compound derived from moracin-O, impedes HIF1α accumulation by targeting the protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2B1 (hnRNPA2B1), inhibiting the initiation of HIF1α translationa novel mechanism of action (94). | 10.2 Clinical trials and studies Various clinical studies further assess the efficacy of the inhibitors targeting the HIF pathway ( Table 2 ). | Another trial (NCT05119335) examines NKT2152, a HIF2α inhibitor, in advanced (ccRCC), exploring its potential to disrupt cancer growth by inhibiting both HIF2α and CDK46 (98). | Moreover, inhibitors like PX-478, EZN-2968 and other small molecules targeting HIF1α effectively reduce HIF1α protein levels, contributing to tumor regression and, in some cases, leading to prolonged disease stabilization (100102). | Thus, the crucial role of HIF1α in cancer progression has catalyzed the development of numerous inhibitors targeting its various functions, which are currently under investigation in preclinical and clinical stages. | These inhibitors disrupt HIF1αs mRNA expression, protein synthesis, stabilization, dimerization with HIF1β, DNA binding, and transcriptional activity. | In light of the emerging importance of the SMURF2-HIF1α axis, these developments could be enhanced by combining HIF1α inhibitors with strategies that modulate SMURF2 activity. | Future research should focus on developing specific SMURF2 inhibitors to enhance cancer cell sensitivity to ferroptosis, potentially overcoming resistance to other cell death mechanisms. | Table 3 delineates a spectrum of inhibitory strategies, each targeting distinct stages of HIF1-alphas lifecycle from transcriptional initiation to degradation, showcasing the depth of potential interventions. |

Camptothecin, CRLX101, Metformin Inhibit HIF1α across various lifecycle stages Thus, Targeting the SMURF2-HIF1α axis represents a novel approach to counteracting the adaptive mechanisms cancer cells employ within the TME. | Table 4 is for selected HIF1 inhibitors demonstrated to prevent chemoradiotherapy resistance in various cancer or cancer cell lines reviewed by Bui and colleagues. | Table 4 Selected HIF1 inhibitors that underwent clinical or laboratory testing. | The inherent challenge in directly targeting transcription factors like HIF-1, which lack easily accessible active sites, is further complicated because many compounds that inhibit or activate HIF-1 lack isoform specificity. | Most available inhibitors are indirect and can alter mRNA expression or protein degradation, risking further off-target effects and potential resistance as cancer cells may activate compensatory pathways. | Some HIF-1α inhibitors have been reported to affect other signaling pathways, leading to off-target effects. | For instance, certain inhibitors may interfere with angiogenesis and normal cellular responses to hypoxia, raising concerns about their specificity and safety profiles (12). | Logistically, developing specific inhibitors that can precisely target the SMURF2-HIF1 interaction without affecting other pathways is challenging. | The complexity of the protein-protein interaction network in which these molecules operate necessitates highly selective and potent inhibitors, which are challenging to design and optimize. | Moreover, the pharmacokinetic properties of these inhibitorsensuring they are delivered effectively to the tumor site without degradation or unacceptable toxicitypose additional challenges. | Overcoming this would require combination therapies or next-generation inhibitors to prevent or circumvent resistance mechanisms. | Introducing compounds such as Pep7 reduces SMURF2s cellular levels, affecting cancer cell proliferation and augmenting cancer therapy by increasing the cytotoxicity of existing treatments (125). | This approach incorporates selected modifications in putative inhibitors to probe and optimize the interaction with the SMURF2-HIF1α complex. | Lead compounds would also be optimized for efficacy and to enhance their pharmaceutical properties. | At the El-Deiry laboratory, the synthesized compounds will be evaluated to assess their inhibition of the SMURF2-HIF1α interaction selectively. | It is part of a wider strategy to combine these inhibitors with current treatments, blocking survival pathways often activated in resistant tumors. | The main aim is to develop precision medicine, customize treatments to specific tumor traits, and thoroughly evaluate these compounds in clinical trials (75, 126). | The utilization of CDK46 inhibitors, such as palbociclib, has demonstrated a novel approach to reduce HIF1α levels and impair the hypoxic response in tumors. | 15.1 Proteomic insights and the role of SMURF2 Further investigation involved a proteomic screen on HIF1α immunoprecipitated from hypoxic colorectal cancer cells treated with CDK inhibitors. | The screen revealed that SMURF2, a SMAD-specific E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, was enriched in cells treated with the CDK46 inhibitor palbociclib, highlighting SMURF2s crucial role in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of HIF1α. | Knockdown experiments further demonstrated that reducing SMURF2 levels increased basal HIF1α expression, even in CDK inhibitors. | This pioneering work highlights the potential of targeting CDKs with specific inhibitors like palbociclib to destabilize HIF1α, offering fresh avenues to impede the hypoxic response integral to tumor survival and proliferation. | By incorporating SMURF2-based interventions with CDK46 inhibitors or heat shock protein HSP-90 inhibitors, there is potential to synergize effects on HIF1α degradation, disrupting cancer cells hypoxic adaptations more robustly. | Therefore, the development of selective SMURF2 inhibitors that avoid unintended interactions and minimize systemic toxicity is crucial.",

disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of abnormal protein aggregates, such as betaamyloid (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles, leading to cognitive decline and memory loss. | Current treatments for AD primarily offer symptomatic relief, with cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists showing limited success in slowing disease progression. | In contrast, microglia in the adult CNS display a ramified morphology, indicative of a surveillance state where they exert neuroprotective functions . | Hericium erinaceus, an edible and medicinal mushroom, has garnered attention for its neuroprotective properties, particularly in agerelated neurological disorders such as AD . | The mycelium of Hericium erinaceus (HEMy) contains bioactive compounds known as erinacines, which include cyathane diterpenoids such as erinacine A (HEA), erinacine C (HEC), and the recently identified sesterterpene erinacine S (HES) . | These compounds, isomers with similar molecular weights (Figure S1), have been previously reported to have neuroprotective effects primarily through promoting nerve growth factor (NGF) synthesis and exhibiting antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties . | By examining microglial morphology, functional phenotypes, and gene expression in mixed glial cultures, alongside assessments of glycemic control, nesting behavior, Aβ burden, plaqueassociated microglial activation, and neurogenesis in HFSTZAPPPS1 mice, we aimed to uncover novel mechanisms by which erinacines exert their neuroprotective effects. | The connectivity map (CMap) is a database that stores the gene expression profiles of numerous U.S. Food and Drug Administrationapproved drugs and other small molecules. | In summary, cortical homogenates were combined in equal amounts with a homogenization buffer that included 4 SDS and protease inhibitors. | These findings suggest that HEA promotes the differentiation of microglia into an antiinflammatory M2like phenotype, suggesting that erinacines promote microglia toward neuroprotective phenotype. | This analysis encompassed perturbagen classes (PCLs)categorized by mechanism of actionand perturbagen compounds (PCs). | Within group D4, the three predominant PCLs were bromodomain inhibitors, leucinerich repeat kinase inhibitors, and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. | Notably, HDAC inhibitors were identified as a shared PCL across groups D4, S1, and C1. | Additionally, heat shock protein (HSP) inhibitors were common in groups D4 and C1. | PCL Score Common group D4

Note: The PCL, perturbagen score, and common functions to other groups were indicated. | For perturbagen compounds (PCs) with scores above 90.0, the D4 group matched with 60 PCs, the A1 group with 11 PCs, the S1 group with 51 PCs, and the C1 group with 52 PCs, as indicated in Table S1 and other data not shown. | Specifically, two PCs, XMD885 (a mitogenactivated protein kinase inhibitor) and XMD892 (an AMPK inhibitor), were common between groups D4 and A1. | Additionally, two PCs, apicidin and NCH51 (the HDAC inhibitors), were shared between groups D4 and C1. | Vemurafenib and pyroxamide, which act as an RAF kinase inhibitor and an HDAC inhibitor, were common between groups D4 and S1 (Figure 4A; Table S1). | Furthermore, one PC, WT171 (an HDAC inhibitor), was common among groups A1, C1, and S1. | This consistent association with HDAC inhibitors across multiple groups, combined with their similar mechanisms of action, suggests that erinacines may exert their effects, at least in part, by modulating HDAC activity. | Aβ, amyloid β protein; GO, gene ontology; GOBP, gene ontology biological process; GOCC, gene ontology cellular component; GOMF, gene ontology molecular function; GSEA, Gene

oxide synthase; PC, perturbagen compound; ROS, reactive oxygen species. | These findings highlight the potential of erinacines to modulate microglial morphology and function, promoting a transition toward a more mature and neuroprotective phenotype. | The biological processes enriched among the commonly downregulated genes included catalytic complex (GO:1902494), hydrolase activity (GO:0016787), various forms of nucleotide binding (GO:0035639, GO:0032555, GO:0017076, and GO:0032553), protein binding (GO:005515), tubulin binding (GO:0015631), and DNAbinding transcription activator activity specific to RNA polymerase II (GO:0001228), as depicted in Figure 5B and Table S4. | To confirm the involvement of HDAC in microglial phenotype changes, amoeboid DIFM1microglia were treated with HDAC inhibitors at DIV17. | Two acridinebased HDAC inhibitors, designated as 11b and 11 h, were utilized in this study. | Compound 11b demonstrates superior inhibitory activity against class IIa and class IIb HDACs compared to suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), while 11 h selectively inhibits HDAC6 . | Additionally, 11b has been identified as a multitarget inhibitor that affects HDAC, Aβ aggregation, and acetylcholine esterase (AChE). | Following HDAC inhibitor treatment, DIFM1microglia were activated with LPS (100 ngμl) as depicted in Figure 1. | Remarkably, DIFM1microglia treated with HDAC inhibitors 11b and 11 h exhibited ramification and developed elongated protrusions, indicating a transition to a surveillance state (Figure S3). | These observations suggest that HDAC inhibitors can promote microglia toward a ramified, surveillancelike state, and suppress microglial activation. | FIGURE 6 The effect of HDAC inhibitors on microglial phenotype changes in DIFM1. | Erinacines, the bioactive compounds of Hericium erinaceus mushroom, have been reported to have a neuroprotective effect in APPPS1 mice ; however, their potential to modulate microglial morphology, elucidate underlying mechanisms of action, and address metabolic dysfunction in AD has not been thoroughly investigated. | This highlights a previously unrecognized role of erinacines in maintaining microglial homeostasis, potentially contributing to their neuroprotective effects. | Moreover, HEA treatment of DIFM1microglia increased the expression of the M2 microglia marker CD206 and decreased the expression of the M1 microglia marker CD86, suggesting its potential to shift microglia toward a more neuroprotective state. | HDAC inhibition was identified as a key pathway, supported by our finding that erinacines closely resemble HDAC inhibitors in their mechanism of action. | This is significant because HDAC inhibitors have been shown to promote microglial ramification , suggesting that erinacines might regulate microglial morphology through similar pathways. | Treatment of DIFM1microglia with the HDAC inhibitors 11b and 11 h positively modulated microglia morphology, leading to a more ramified state. | Interestingly, HDAC inhibitors could induce microglia ramification and suppress DIFM1microglia activation after adding LPS, suggesting that HDAC activity is directly involved in maintaining a less inflammatory, more ramified microglial phenotype. | Thus, while HDAC inhibitors and erinacines both modulate microglial function, the unique effects of erinacines suggest that erinacines might influence microglia through a combination of HDAC inhibition and other, possibly maturationrelated, pathways. | Although erinacines have been shown to be neuroprotective in normal APPPS1 mice, metabolic stress can alter drug metabolism, distribution, and efficacy, leading to different therapeutic outcomes. | The ability of erinacines to shift microglia toward a more neuroprotective phenotype, reduce amyloidbeta accumulation, and improve metabolic parameters underscores their promise as a multifaceted therapeutic approach. | WeiJan Huang provided compounds 11b and

dysfunction among cancer survivors. | Spatial transcriptomic profiling comparing the RT Vehicle with the RT RZ group showed gene expression signatures of neuroprotection of hippocampal excitatory neurons post-RZ. | In summary, oral administration of RZ represents a viable and translationally feasible neuroprotective approach against RICD.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186s40478-024-01906-9. | Clinical investigations have revealed a noteworthy correlation between the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cognitive outcomes in cancer patients exposed to systemic chemotherapy . | Based on this scientific premise, we hypothesize that RT-induced impairments in neuronal function, elevated neuroinflammation, and cognitive deficits culminate following reductions in neuroprotective BDNF. | As a proof of principle to support a neurotrophic factors influence on the damaged, irradiated brain, we focused on male mice for this study. | Riluzole treatment augments hippocampal BDNF levels in the irradiated mice The above cognitive function data indicates a neuroprotective impact of RZ treatment in the irradiated brain. | This data signifies the neuroprotective impact of RZ treatment in the irradiated brain leading to reductions in gliosis and cognitive dysfunction.Fig. | Importantly, we found upregulated expression of an IEG, nptx1, which is known to play a role in synaptic plasticity and neuroprotection, in the hippocampal excitatory neurons in the RT RZ group

of riluzole treatment-mediated in vivo BDNF enhancement against cranial RT-induced cognitive dysfunction. | Our hypothesis that enhancing levels of a neurotrophic factor in the irradiated brain would improve cognitive function is based on the scientific premise showing a correlation between BDNF levels and brain function. | Conversely, neuroprotective effects of BDNF-mediated cognitive recovery in a 20 Gy acute cranial RT model were blocked following treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that disrupts BDNF signaling . | A number of studies also suggest a positive correlation between improved cognitive indices and BDNF in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy , thus supporting our hypothesis that in vivo BDNF enhancement is neuroprotective against cranial RT-induced cognitive decline. | BDNF has been shown to play neuroprotective and functional roles in maintaining neuronal and dendritic health, activity-dependent neuronal plasticity, and cognitive function . | NT3, similar to BDNF, is a neurotrophic factor and plays an important role in neuronal development, synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity . | Collectively, this data supports the neuroprotective role of RZ treatment and BDNF augmentation in preserving mature, excitatory neuronal function in the irradiated brain and, thereby, cognitive recovery. | 7), neuroprotective effects of RZ treatment can also positively impact other neural functions, including increasing LTP, reducing neuronal glutamate release, increasing glial glutamate reuptake, and inhibiting glutamatergic receptor activity that may influence irradiated brain function. | In vitro experiments using primary mouse astrocytes showed a two to threefold increase in BDNF, GDNF (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor), and NGF (nerve growth factor) synthesis 24 h after initiation of RZ treatment . | Thus, both neurotrophic and neuronal mechanisms may contribute to the beneficial neurocognitive impact of RZ on the irradiated brain. | Nonetheless, this study provides proof of concept that in vivo augmentation of BDNF via oral administration of RZ in radiotherapy-injured brain is neuroprotective. | Conclusion Our data provides pre-clinical evidence for a translationally feasible approach: oral administration of an FDA-approved compound, riluzole, to enhance BDNF in vivo to ameliorate cranial radiation

Castrén et al. | Ultimately, neurotrophic factors induce neurite growth (Numakawa et al. | Despite the encouraging perspectives on the applications of psychedelics, their safe employment requires a deeper understanding of their mechanisms, as the currently available compounds generally target multiple neurotransmitter systems and may lead to undesired effects (Belouin and Henningfield 2018; Brunton et al. | For this reason, we sought to cover the effects of such compounds on the plasticity process associated with neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG), rather than in the SVZ-OB system (Christie and Cameron 2006;

This interaction analysis provides a structural understanding of how Lurasidone and Paliperidone bind to CatB which underscores their potential to collectively interfere with the binding site. | These insights into the molecular interactions contribute significantly to the characterization of the binding mechanism and guide the exploration of these molecules as potential CatB inhibitors. | Both molecules displayed multiple interactions as the reference inhibitor Ca-07Me with CatBs binding site residues important for its functional activity (Fig 2C). | This molecular insight highlighted the potential inhibitory mechanisms of Lurasidone and Paliperidone and underscored their promise as candidates for repurposed CatB inhibitors. | 10.1371journal.pone.0316010.g002 Fig 2 The two-dimensional representation of CatB residues and their interaction with (A) Lurasidone, (B) Paliperidone, and (C) Ca-074Me. 10.1371journal.pone.0316010.t003 Table 3 Various interaction types and their corresponding residues involved in binding CatB with the identified compounds. | No. Compound Affinity (kcalmol) Interaction Hydrogen bonds AlkylPi-interactions Van der Waals Other Lurasidone 8.8 Gly198 Tyr75, Val176, His199 Gln23, Gly24, Ser25, Cys26, Gly27, Cys29, Asn72, Gly73, Gly74, Tyr75, Thr120, Gly121, Glu122, Cys119, Pro76, His110, His111, Gly197, Met196, Trp221 Paliperidone 8.8 Gln23, Cys26, Cys29, Trp30, His110, Gly73, Gly74, Gly198 Pro76, Cys119, Ala173, Ala200 Gly24, Ser25, Gly27, Tyr75, Glu122, His199 His111 Ca-074Me 6.5 Gly24, Cys29, Gly73, His110, Gly198 Pro76, Val176, His199, Ala200 Gln23, Ser25, Cys26, Gly27, Trp30, Gly73, Gly74, Thr120, Gly121, Gly197, Trp221 In addition to repurposing Lurasidone and Paliperidone, further modifications of the structures can be made to increase the biological activities of these compounds. | These modifications can provide useful data for the additional lead optimization to increase the CatB inhibitory activity of Lurasidone and Paliperidone. | Further experimentation and fine-tuning of these changes may lead to the development of better inhibitors of CatB. | This analysis highlights Paliperidone and Lurasidones potential as effective inhibitors based on their stable binding. | 3.4.3. Dynamics of intermolecular hydrogen bonding In addition to intramolecular hydrogen bonds, the time evolution of intermolecular hydrogen bonding was evaluated to explore the stability of the docked CatB with Lurasidone, Paliperidone, and Ca-074Me. The presence of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the protein and small molecules governs the formation of stable docked complexes . | When comparing with the reference inhibitor Ca-074Me, it showed 17 hydrogen bonds with CatB, with a higher stability of 13 bonds (Fig 6C, upper panel). | Among the studied compounds, Paliperidone had the most favorable binding energy at 38.82 kJmol, which indicates that it interacts most favorably with CatB. | Based on these results, Paliperidone and Lurasidone can be considered as potential inhibitor candidates with high binding affinity towards CatB. | The congruency of these results with other simulation analyses lends credibility to our findings and the prospect of these compounds as CatB inhibitors. | Additional experimental work would be required to substantiate the observed inhibitory properties of these compounds on CatB activity. | Both compounds demonstrated high binding affinities to functionally relevant residues in the CatB catalytic pocket, supporting their selectivity and therapeutic potential. | Structural stability observed during MD simulations, along with insights from PCA and FEL analyses, further validated their potential as CatB inhibitors. | Despite these limitations, Lurasidone and Paliperidone provide a strong foundation for repurposing as lead compounds for AD and cancer therapies. | Supporting information S1 Fig Chemical structures of CA-074Me, E-64, and selected synthesized molecules as CatB inhibitors. | (DOCX) S2 Fig Re-docking of a co-crystalized dipeptidyl nitrile inhibitor of CatB showing superimposition to each other.",

shown by inhibition studies using NFκB p65 inhibitors and siRNA. | Blocking the TREM1 pathway with an LP17 inhibitor also reduced the activation of the p38 MAPK pathway, indicating the significant role of TREM1 in activating p38 MAPK through phosphorylation . | Pleconaril, pocapavir, pirodavir, and vapendavir are WINlike compounds occupying the hydrophobic pocket in the canyon of VP1, as shown in Table 1 . | This study signifies distinct mechanisms imposed by drugs with different EVD68 strains Pleconaril analogs with substitutions at isoxazole and phenyl ring VP1 in vitro

revealed an overlapping binding site between R856932 and pleconaril, highlighting the compounds mechanism and potential resistance pathways . | Analysis of the structureactivity relationship (SAR) and the VP1 proteins structural biology led to identifying compounds with significant in vitro antiviral activity, including broadspectrum efficacy against various EVD68 strains (prototype and

bioactive metabolites have become a significant focus of research due to their efficacy and costeffectiveness . | Pseudolaric Acid B (PB), a compound extracted from Pseudolarix kaempferi Gordon, is predominantly utilized in managing dermatological conditions . | These findings suggest compounds inducing G2M phase arrest, like pseudolaric acid B, oridonin, and erianin, could be promising in treating EVD68related diseases, highlighting the need for further investigation into Chinese medicinal herbs for potential therapeutic applications . | The efficacy of avoenin against prototype EVD68 was evaluated, revealing an EC50 of 2.0 μM, approximately ten times less potent than the capsid inhibitor pleconaril, which has an EC50 of 0.23 μM. | Despite the EC50 of avoenin not being particularly low compared to other capsidtargeting enterovirus inhibitors operating in the nanomolar range, the study signifies the identification of avoenin from avocado as a compound with considerable antiEVD68 activity . | However, Pleconaril and other capsid inhibitors failed to show potent antiviral activity against other EVs and developed resistance and unwanted side effects in the clinical setting; therefore, they could not attain approval from the FDA. | The leading compound, 19, distinguished itself through its broadspectrum efficacy and strong in vitro performance, attributed to its enhanced interaction with the EVD68 VP1 protein. | Further research into these compounds bioavailability and metabolic stability could pave the way for new therapeutic strategies against EVD68 infections . | Protease inhibitors (PI) have been evaluated against multiple EVD68 strains. | Although located significantly distant from the inhibitors binding site, this mutation indirectly affects rupintrivirs binding efficiency through subtle structural modifications rather than direct interactions. | Exploring herbal compounds and their active components, particularly those derived from TCHM, has shed light on their potential as effective and affordable treatments against viral infections. | These findings highlight the need for further research into these compounds as potential treatments for EVD68related diseases . | Despite setbacks with traditional antivirals such as pleconaril, promising developments in novel quinoline derivatives, protease inhibitors, and the exploration of herbal compounds, alongside the potential use of hIVIG, offer new paths forward. | Future research should focus on the rational design of inhibitors and further evaluation of combination therapies, potentially broadening our arsenal against not only EVD68 but also other enteroviruses.",

      "text_block": "As a consequence, the development of anti-aging compounds based on the rational targeting of specific pathways has fallen short of the goal. | To date, the most impressive compound is rapamycin, a natural bacterial product initially identified as an antifungal, and only subsequently discovered to have anti-aging properties. | This review is the first to gather together published studies conducted both in vitro and in numerous vertebrate species to demonstrate that these compounds target aging pathways at the cellular level and provide benefits in multiple aging-associated conditions in relevant animal models and in humans. | A preferable approach would be the discovery of a single compound that by itself exhibited the desired pharmacodynamic health benefits through synergistic activity across the multiple interconnected networks involved in aging. | Anti-aging compounds In 2002 the National Institute of Aging established a screening program (Interventions Testing Program) to evaluate the effect of treatments on the lifespan of the genetically heterogeneous UM-HET3 mouse stock9. | Nine compounds have been identified to date: aspirin and nordihydroguaiaretic acid10, canagliflozin11, captopril12, glycine13, acarbose and Protandim14, 17α-estradiol15, and rapamycin12,16,17. | Of these, only rapamycin, administered at non-immunosuppressive doses, emerged as the most promising human clinical candidate in large part due to its efficacy in the mouse study in both genders, the overall clinical experience with the compound in organ transplantation, and relatively few adverse side effects at the proposed human doses. | A second compound, metformin, widely used as a first-line treatment for Type 2 diabetes, is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials of life extension based on the results of longevity studies in rodents conducted in several laboratories18. | The discovery of shark aminosterols We discovered aminosterols in the liver of the dogfish shark (Squalus acanthias) in a search for anti-microbial compounds supporting the vertebrate innate immune system2022. | This search began some years earlier with the discovery of anti-microbial peptides in the skin of the African Clawed frog (Xenopus laevis), motivated by the hypothesis that the surprising degree of immunity exhibited by certain animals could be due to the presence of simple anti-microbial compounds23. | From many studies, we can construct a cellular-based mechanism of action for trodusquemine that helps explain the diverse pharmacological activities of this compound and its potential therapeutic applications (Table 1).Table 1Pharmacological activities of trodusquemine and its potential therapeutic applicationsEffect on

resultant effects on cellular function, such as ER stress, are well-recognized components of the pathophysiology of the diseases of aging65,72. | PTP1B is a membrane-associated tyrosine phosphatase that plays a major role in the regulation of the activity of many receptor tyrosine kinases that utilize the PI3KAKT pathway, such as insulin and IGF1, and the JAK-Stat pathway, such as the neurotrophins and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). | Trodusquemine is the most extensively studied inhibitor of PTP1B, with a large body of research conducted in animals that appears to support the targeting of PTP1B in different disease states (Table 1). | Since these effects could be observed by either systemic or intra-cerebroventicular administration of much smaller amounts of the compound, we concluded that trodusquemine acted via a central mechanism36,37. | Autoradiographic studies in mice administered tritiated trodusquemine confirmed that the compound accessed the brain and localized to specific areas of the brain, such as the hypothalamus and the arcuate nucleus, which are involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis, diurnal rhythm, and a multitude of other physiological functions. | The compound was administered as an iv infusion over 30 minutes at doses ranging from 330 mgm2. | Attempts to reformulate the compound to permit administration by other routes were not performed, leading to the discontinuation of the development program. | In a parallel experiment, tunicamycin had no effect on arteries from PTP1B knock-out mice, consistent with the PTP1B inhibitory effect of trodusquemine in this model. | The discovery of small molecules that can safely restore regenerative capacity lost during aging would have great therapeutic value in many age-related diseases. | Trodusquemine was discovered to have potent regenerative properties in an unbiased screen of diverse compounds using the zebrafish tail amputation model34. | As yet, no studies of life prolongation by trodusquemine in mice have been published, but we can compare the two compounds with respect to their known effects on the mechanisms underlying aging-associated diseases. | Rapamycin was shown to inhibit fungal growth by targeting an intracellular protein named TOR95; an orthologous protein target, mTOR was shown to be the target of the compound in mammalian cells9698. | Trodusquemine has been shown to effectively reverse rapamycin-induced diabetes, through its inhibitory effects on hepatic gluconeogenesis112. | Conclusion We have shown that trodusquemine targets several major age-related conditions, suggesting that this compound and related aminosterols have the potential to extend the healthy human lifespan. | We favor endogenous compounds with anti-aging properties that have evolved over hundreds of millions of years within the biological context of long-lived animals over man-made compounds targeting single pathways. | Although we naturally think of life extension, in a philosophical sense, as exceedingly complex, potential solutions could be straightforward, such as the gradual decline with age in the expression of an endogenous compound.",

Manet et al., 2020; Manet et al., 2022). | This was the case of the genes: Cxcl10, Nos2, Ccl2, Ccl5, and Il1b with a significant or near significant inhibitory effect also observed for the C4 and C3 genes coding for the corresponding complement factors (Figure 6a). | A significant iPKRdependent inhibitory effect was observed for the ZIKVinduced expression of the Aif1 gene (Figure 6b) whereas, under the same conditions, treatment with iPKR had no effect on the expression of genes not affected by ZIKV infection such as Bdnf and Mef2c (Figure S5). | The inhibitory effect of iPKR was not a consequence of either a diminution of ZIKV RNA (Figure 6c) or of the expression of the Ifnb1 gene and of major ISGs (Ifna4, Isg15, Eif2ak2) that were not significantly affected by iPKR treatment (Figure 6d). | CC071 mice (56 weeksold) were treated with DMSO or the inhibitor of PKR (IPKR) 1 h before and 3 days after IC inoculation of either NaCl (NI) or 105 FFU of ZIKV. | (f) Brain sections of ZIKVinfected mice treated either with DMSO (ZIKV DMSO) or PKR inhibitor C16 (ZIKV iPKR) were labeled with antiNeuN (specific of neurons), antiIBA1 (specific of microglia) and antiNS2B (specific of ZIKV) antibodies and with DNA labeled with DAPI. | (eg) PCMCs (e, f) or PCNs (g) were incubated with DMSO or the inhibitor of PKR (IPKR) 1 h before NDV infection. | 3.7 PKR is a major regulator of STAT1 phosphorylation in microglial cells In order to question the mechanism through which PKR could vehicle the response of microglia to IFNsI, we analyzed the capacity of PKR to regulate the phosphorylation of the signal transducer activator of transcription STAT1 that regulates IFNAR signaling (Schneider et al., 2014) and has been associated with a proinflammatory state of microglia (Butturini et al., 2019; Rangaraju et al., 2018). | In addition, we analyzed the phosphorylation of the inhibitor of NFκB (IκB) whose phosphorylation by PKR is a well described mechanism that links PKR to the induction of the expression of proinflammatory genes (GalBenAri et al., 2019). | (ah, j) Primary cultured microglial cells (PCMCs) were incubated with DMSO or the inhibitor of PKR (C16) for 1 h before being (a, e) either non (NI) or NDVinfected and (c, g, j) either nontreated (NT) or treated with conditioned media from non (CM_NI) or ZIKVinfected (CM_ZIKV) primary cultured neurons. | The major inhibitory effect of iPKR on STAT1 phosphorylation also explains the strong inhibition of ISGs expression in NDVinfected microglia treated with iPKR although Ifnb1 gene expression remained significantly induced due to the presence of phosphorylated IRF3 that was not affected by iPKR. | Primary cultured microglial cells were incubated with DMSO or the inhibitor of PKR (C16) for 1 h before being either nontreated (NT), treated with conditioned media from non (CM_NI) or ZIKVinfected (CM_ZIKV) primary cultured neurons (PCNs) or ZIKV alone (NT_ZIKV) for 6 h. | CC071 mice (56 weeksold) were treated with DMSO or the inhibitor of PKR (iPKR) 1 h before and 3 days after IC inoculation of either NaCl (NI) or 105 FFU of ZIKV. | Primary cultures of microglial cells (PCMCs) or neurons (PCNs) were either (a) treated with DMSO or the inhibitor of PKR (iPKR) 1 h before being non (NI) or NDV infected or (b) nontreated (NT) and noninfected. | Primary cultured microglia cells were treated with (a) DMSO or the inhibitor of PKR (C16) for 1 h at 50 mM final concentration before being treated with 1500 U or (b) increasing amounts of recIFNB (in the absence of C16) for 6 h before collection of RNAs.

      "text_block": "A multitude of neuroprotective agents have been developed to exert neuroprotective effects and improve the prognosis of patients with ischemic stroke. | Statins are a class of pharmaceutical agents that act as inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which are commonly used to reduce lipid levels in patients with cardiovascular disease (Christophe et al. | (2019) Several clinical investigations have demonstrated that statins have a neuroprotective function in the treatment of ischemic stroke (Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease (LIPID) Study Group 1998; Collins et al. | demonstrated that RhoA inhibitors, ROCK inhibitors, and actin polymerization inhibitors enhance eNOS mRNA in cultured ECs by extending the half-life of eNOS mRNA rather than affecting eNOS gene transcription (Laufs et al. | This effect could be inhibited by compound C, an AMPK antagonist. | We foresee a more comprehensive and robust understanding of the pleiotropic effects of statins in neuroprotection, as research on statins and KLF2 in ischemic stroke continues to expand. | ECs treated with XMD8-92, an ERK5 inhibitor, and transfected with ERK5 siRNA demonstrated that ERK5 inhibition abolished the suppression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 production triggered by TNF-α (Wu et al. | (2019) found that ERK inhibitors significantly inhibited the inflammatory response induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, and simvastatin significantly inhibited the LPS-induced increase in TNF-α and IL-6 levels in microglia. | However, the inhibitory effect of simvastatin was significantly greater than that of ERK inhibitors alone, suggesting that statins may also inhibit the secretion of inflammatory cytokines by microglia through other mechanisms. | Previous research has shown that statins stimulate the production of suppressor of cytokine secretion (SOCS), which then functions as inhibitors of the JAKSTAT1 pathway by either blocking JAK tyrosine kinases or preventing STAT1 factors from binding to the cytoplasmic structural domain of the receptor (Huang et al. | Regarding most studies of neuroprotective agents in ischemic stroke and considering the pleiotropic effects of statins on neurons (Gutiérrez-Vargas et al. | The pleiotropic effects of statins in neurons also modulate synaptogenesis Anti-apoptosis Neuronal apoptosis-related signaling pathways are among the targets of most neuroprotective agents, and statins are no exception. | After the addition of atorvastatin, which inhibits the TLR4TRAF6NF-κB pathway, the expression of Bax and caspase-3 is suppressed, and the expression of Bcl-2 is significantly upregulated, increasing the rate of hippocampal neuronal survival (Han et al. | Statins are neuroprotective in ECs by improving EC function and maintaining BBB integrity through the activation of the ERK signaling pathway. | Thus, simvastatin can enhance neuronal autophagic activity following ischemic stroke by regulating the p-AMPKLC3BLAMP2 axis, ultimately promoting neuronal survival. | Conclusion Statins, besides their lipid-lowering effects, can also regulate individual members of the NVU through pleiotropic effects, resulting in the maintenance of BBB integrity and homeostasis, ultimately producing neuroprotective effects in ischemic stroke. | However, owing to various factors, numerous issues still need to be resolved for the wide application of statins as neuroprotective agents in the clinic, such as the type, dosage, and mode of drug delivery, which need to be explored and supplemented by more studies.",

Some of the advantages of herbal medicines and extracted compounds in treatment for IRDs include: (1) Genetic testing cannot detect all RP-associated genes or compound heterozygosity. | Each Chinese medicine recipe contains hundreds of known and unknown chemical compounds. | Presently, China recognizes over 10,000 types of traditional Chinese medicines, serving as a vast reservoir of organic compounds waiting to be explored. | From these organic precursor compounds, diverse drugs for numerous diseases can be developed in the future. | 5.2 Current market value of medicinal plant compounds Medicinal plant compounds have a long history, and many early medicines were derived from natural metabolites found in plants. | Plants contain a vast array of compounds, including secondary metabolites, which can be broadly categorized into three groups: phenolics, terpenoids, and alkaloids (48). | Numerous natural compounds from these plants which now serve as active ingredients in many modern pharmaceuticals. | These compounds exhibit chemical novelties that can serve as starting points for developing potential drug candidates targeting complex diseases. | Medicinal plant compounds encompass a variety of active ingredients and secondary metabolites that demonstrate favorable properties, including anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, antiviral, anti-cancer, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic effects. | Antioxidant effect rd10 7 Safranal Stigmas of saffron (Crocus sativus L.)

      "text_block": "These observations prompted us to search for phagocytosis modulators (enhancers or inhibitors) with therapeutic potential. | We performed two complementary HTS campagnes: at Achucarro, we used primary cultures of mouse microglia and compounds of the Prestwick Chemical Library; at Roche, we used human iPSC derived macrophagelike cells and a proprietary chemogenomic library with 2200 compounds with known mechanismofaction. | Next, we validated the more robust compounds using hippocampal organotypic cultures and identified two phagocytosis inhibitors: trifluoperazine, a dopaminergic and adrenergic antagonist used as an antipsychotic and antineoplastic; and deoxytubercidin, a ribose derivative. | Finally, we tested whether these compounds were able to modulate phagocytosis of apoptotic newborn cells in the adult hippocampal neurogenic niche in vivo by administering them into the mouse hippocampus using osmotic minipumps. | Together, these observations in clinic and preclinical models suggest that targeting microglial phagocytosis with enhancers or activators in diseases where it is defective, or inhibitors in diseases where it is exacerbated could have therapeutic value to accelerate the clearance and recovery of the brain parenchyma in a large number of brain disorders. | One wellknown phagocytosis inhibitor is clopidogrel, an antiplatelet agent used to prevent blood clots that antagonizes P2RY12 (Sipe et al., 2016), a purinergic receptor, which is used by microglia to recognize apoptotic, cells (DiazAparicio et al., 2020). | To address this gap and identify novel pathways modulating microglial phagocytosis efficiency, here we have used a bottomup approach to identify compounds that could modulate microglial phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, from cell cultures to in vivo. | We used two complementary high throughput phenotypic screenings: at Achucarro (AHTS), primary microglia were screened 600 compound of the Prestwick Chemical Library; at Roche (RHTS) we employed human iPSCderived macrophagelike cells, in which phagocytosis is compromised due to increased expression of alphasynuclein that is caused by an allelic triplication of the SNCA gene (3xSNCA) (Haenseler et al., 2017) and screened with Roches proprietary chemogenomic library (Roudnicky et al., 2020). | We initially identified 12 AHTS compounds and 6 RHTS compounds with phagocytosis modulatory potential that were then validated in organotypic hippocampal cultures and in mice. | This approach allowed us to identify the dopaminergicαadrenergic antagonist trifluoperazine and the ribose derivative deoxytubercidin as inhibitors of microglial phagocytosis. | The pathways in which these compounds are active can now be explored for their therapeutic potential to treat diseases related to indiscriminate phagocytosis. | A chemical library comprising 600 compounds was sourced from the Prestwick Chemical Library, based on the compounds chemical and pharmacological diversity, bioavailability, and safety for humans. | Compounds were diluted to working concentration using the Hamiltons Microlab Star automated liquid handling workstation, and the diluted compounds were manually dispensed to the cells. | The compound screening was performed in 2 phases: in the first phase, we tested the 600 compounds in three replicates at 10 μM and selected the top 30 hit compounds based on their effects on engulfment and degradation of apoptotic cells. | To determine which compounds were of interest in the first phase, we set a threshold equal to the mean activity of all compounds standard deviation. | In the second phase, we rescreened the 30 hit compounds at 3 different concentrations (1, 10, and 100 μM, three replicas per concentration). | In each of the phases, we discriminated the effects of the compounds on either engulfment or degradation of apoptotic cells by using two administration paradigms. | To check the effects on engulfment, microglia was incubated with the compounds for 2 h prior to coincubation with the apoptotic cells for 1 additional hour while maintaining the compounds in the medium. | To check the effects on degradation, microglia were coincubated with the apoptotic cells for 1 h and, after removing the excess of unphagocytosed apoptotic cells, they were allowed to degrade the engulfed cells in the presence of fresh media with the compounds for 2 h. | 2.5 AHTS hit selection and confirmation The following variables for each compound were obtained: number of microglia, mean area of Vampire particles per microglia, percentage of phagocytic microglia, and number of phagocytosed objects per microglia. | We visualized the effect of the compounds using a scatter plot to compare PC1 and PC2 and observed that most compounds clustered homogenously. | However, some compounds did not cluster with the rest of the compounds, indicating that they were some potential candidate compounds to modulate phagocytosis (effects if engulfment displayed in Supp. | We then analyzed how each principal component (PC) separated each compound and the way each variable weighted in each PC: PC1 explained close to 60 of the variance, as it had the largest eigenvalue, whereas PC2 explained 32 (Supp. | Thus, we selected the variable number of phagocytosed particles per microglia to assess the potential of these compounds to enhance or block either engulfment or degradation. | After this 2step filtering procedure, we checked the integrity of the data by analyzing two parameters in the dataset: 1, the variability between compounds, to determine how similar was the effect of all compounds by comparing the effect of each compound versus the mean effect of all compounds; and 2, the variability between replicas, to determine how similar is the variability of the effect of all compounds by comparing the SD (between wells) of each compound versus the mean SD of all compounds. | The filtering procedure had no effect on the variability between compounds but reduced the variability between replicas (p .001, Supp. | Thus, variability was reduced while preserving the differences between compounds for both engulfment and degradation. | Next, we removed the data of those compounds that had a toxic effect on microglia (70 of the control). | From 600 initial compounds, 63 were eliminated due to their toxicity in the engulfment experiments, 23 were eliminated due to their toxicity during the degradation experiments, and 4 were eliminated due to their toxicity in both series of experiments (leaving a final number of 510 compounds). | This final filtering did not affect either the variability between replicas or the variability between compounds (Supp. | PCA showed that while most compounds clustered homogenously, some compounds did not cluster along PC 1, indicating potential phagocytosis modulators (Supp. | We followed the same data homogenization strategy as in Phase 1 to decrease variability between replicas by filtering out replicas where the number of microglia and the number of phagocytosed objects showed high variability between wells, and finally filtering out compounds based on their toxicity (Supp. | As in the first phase, we achieved a decrease in the variability between replicas (p .001 in engulfment, no significant differences in degradation) without affecting variability between compounds (p .05) (Supp. | In this phase, no compounds were eliminated due to toxicity on microglia: only three compounds at their highest dose (100 μM) showed toxic effects on microglia and were subsequently removed (at that dose only). | The variability between replicas and compounds was also monitored after eliminating toxic compounds. | The zscore that summarized the effect of each compound across the three concentrations was calculated as follows: ZscoreMeanX1X10X100MeanallStd.devall 2.6 Human iPSC culture and differentiation to macrophagelike cells Two human iPSC lines were used: SBNeo1 as control and SFC8310303 carrying a synuclein triplication (3xSNCA), both generated in the StemBANCC consortia and deposited at European Bank for iPSCs (Gutbier et al., 2020). | A single cell suspension of iPSCs (4 106 cells) was plated into AggreWell 800 iPSCs were plated into AggreWell 800 (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) plates in mTesR1 supplemented with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor (Y27632, Calbiochem Millipore, Burlington, MA). | 2.7 RHTS screening At day 5 of differentiation to macrophagelike, Roches compounds prediluted in culture media were added at 1 μM final concentration, with 6 replicate plates and incubated for 24 h. | 2.8 RHTS hit selection and confirmation In total 2200 compounds were screened at 1 μM with 6 replicates for their potential to increase phagocytosis in the macrophages derived from the 3xSNCA iPSC line. | 2.9 Organotypic cultures and compound incubation Hippocampal organotypic slices were prepared following the protocol described in (Beccari et al., 2018). | At day 7 of culture, hippocampal slices were incubated with 100 μM of the compounds diluted in organotypic culture medium for a total of 6 h. | After 5 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing the compounds and 5 μgmL propidium iodide (PI). | After 1 hour of incubation with compounds and PI, slices were fixed in cold 4 paraformaldehyde solution for 40 min and, after rinsing with 1X PBS, were stored at 4 C until immunofluorescence processing. | Briefly, osmotic minipumps (flow rate 1 μLh; Model 1003D, Alzet) and brain infusion catheter tubes (Alzet) were filled with 100 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Thermo Fisher), Roche compound 1 (deoxytubercidin), Trifluoperazine (Selleckchem), and PSB0739 (Tocris Bioscience) (all at 10 μM concentration in PBS with 1:1000 DMSO) and connected. | To calculate the most consistent effect (X) across concentrations (1, 10, and 100 μM), we calculated a zscore from each compound: zscoreMeanX1X10X100MeanallStd.devall In RHTS, Images were analyzed in parallel to acquisition using Harmony (PerkinElmer; Waltham, MA, USA) predefined building blocks for detection of nuclei using the Hoechst Channel, detection of cytoplasm using the Hoechst reflection within the cytoplasm and the spot detector to detect pHRodo positive spots within the cytoplasm. | Mean, median, SD and SEM of phagocytic index over 6 replicates was calculated and the compounds that robustly induced phagocytosis were selected for further hit validation in dose response. | 3 RESULTS 3.1 Achucarro high throughput screening (AHTS) In the first phase of the AHTS, 600 Prestwick compounds were tested using 2 administration paradigms to check for effects in either engulfment or degradation, in triplicates at 10 μM (Figure 1a,b; Supp. | In order to select the candidate compounds that could modulate phagocytosis, we plotted their effect on engulfment versus degradation (Figure 1c), setting a threshold equal to the mean activity of all compounds SD. | We selected the top 30 compounds that, based on the data distribution, belonged to three different groups: 1, All compounds that surpassed the threshold for enhancing engulfment and degradation; 2, those that crossed the threshold for inhibiting engulfment; and 3, an extra compound that showed a very strong enhancement of engulfment and a very strong inhibition of degradation. | Those 30 candidate compounds were identified and screened in a second phase at 3 concentrations (1, 10, and 100 μM; data from one compound was lost due to technical reasons, resulting in 29 compounds tested) (Supp. | To obtain more robust data about their activity and an estimation of the working concentration of these compounds for their use in vivo, we analyzed them based on a zscore that accounted for a global effect of the 3 concentrations tested. | Those compounds with a zscore greater than 1 or lower than 1 were selected as hits (14 compounds, of which 12 were tested later in organotypic slices) (Figure 1d). | Comparing the results obtained from this phase with the results obtained from phase 1, we observed that some of the compounds displayed the same effect on phase 1 and phase 2 (34.5 of compounds for engulfment and 42.4 for degradation), showing a significant correlation between the two phases (Supp. | However, some compounds displayed opposite results in the two phases, even when we compared the effect of the 10 μM concentration, suggesting that independent testing of the compounds in the two phases is necessary to obtain robust results. | The compounds were categorized in 5 groups: proengulfment compounds; prodegradation, antiengulfment, prodegradation compounds; and a compound with mixed proengulfment and antidegradative properties. | The mechanisms of action of these compounds were multiple, but several of them targeted main neurotransmitter pathways, such as dopamine, serotonin, adrenaline, noradrenaline, and GABA (trifluoperazine, nafronyl oxalate, maprotiline, dobutamine, baclofen). | Another group of compounds targeted sodium and potassium channels (gliclazide, nicardipine, zoxazolamine). | A final group of compounds targeted pathways related to DNA and RNA and are used as antitumoral agents (N6methyladenosine, thioguanosine, doxorubicin). | FIGURE 1 AHTS screening and hit compounds. | In blue, compounds selected as candidate potentiators of phagocytosis. | In mauve, compounds selected as candidate inhibitors of phagocytosis. | (d) Zscore (arbitrary units) of compounds that potentiate engulfment (blue) or degradation (green), and inhibit engulfment (red) or degradation (orange) of apoptotic cells across concentrations, compared to the rest of the compounds. | The effect of the compounds was deemed significant if their engulfment or degradation zscores were higher or lower than 1 (dotted purple lines). | Premacrophages were differentiated to macrophages in the final assay format, incubated with compounds for 24 h and pHRodo labeled apoptotic NPCs for the last 2 h of incubation. | FIGURE 2 RHTS screening, controls, and hit compound identification. | Cells were incubated with 3 times the amount of fixed, pHrodo labeled NSCs. (e) Comparison of the median versus the average effect on 6 replicates of the 2200 compounds at 1 μM on the phagocytosis of macrophages. | Each dot represents one compound, the color indicates the compound source plate and the size of the symbol the standard deviation between replicates (n 6). | (f) Hit compounds from the primary screen were identified as those with phagocytosis above 1.3 relative to control and SEM below 0.2 (blue circle) from the 6 replicates. | The assay hits that were potential inducers of phagocytosis were identified as those compounds with a ratio of phagocytic microglia higher than 1.3 compared to control and SEM below 0.2 (Figure 2f). | From this last group, 6 compounds were selected for further validation in organotypic cultures (Figure 2j,k). | 3.3 Organotypic culture validation of AHTS and RHTS compounds Next, we tested both the AHTS and the RHTS candidate compounds in hippocampal organotypic slices, which retain all the cell types from the CNS, as well as the structures and connectivity (Beccari et al., 2018), and in which apoptotic cell death occurs in the first days of the culture (Lossi et al., 2009). | We incubated the organotypic slices with the compounds at 100 μM (the highest dose used in the AHTS) for 6 h, based on the effective concentration range of drugs we have previously tested to modulate microglial phagocytosis in these cultures (Abiega et al., 2016; Beccari et al., 2023), and analyzed cell death, microglial numbers, microglial phagocytosis of dead (apoptotic and necrotic) cells, and microglial morphology. | The candidate compounds had been categorized in the AHTS into four different groups based on their effects on engulfment and degradation separately. | Therefore, both proengulfment and antidegradation compounds would increase the Ph index, and prodegradation and antiengulfment compounds would decrease it. | These seemingly counterintuitive scenarios can be discriminated by taking into account the total number of dead cells, which should be expected to decrease in proengulfment and prodegradation compounds, and increase in antiengulfment and antidegradation compounds. | Due to technical reasons related to the vehicle in which the compounds were dissolved and the number of compounds, we divided the experiments into different batches. | As controls, we used untreated (UT) slices and the vehicle in which the compounds were dissolved. | First, we tested compounds dissolved in DMSO: potential phagocytosis enhancers Roche compounds Ro16, thioguanosine, N6methyladenosine, danazol, and gliclazide, potential phagocytosis inhibitors oxethazaine and zoxazolamine, and the mixedeffect compound doxorubicin. | We first assessed Roche compounds, and we found that deoxytubercidin (Ro1), a ribose derivative, highly increased the number of apoptotic and PI cells (Figure 3ac), and strongly inhibited their phagocytosis (Figure 3d,e). | In the second batch of Roche compounds, we did not observe any significant changes in cell death, phagocytosis, or microglia numbers compared to the DMSO vehicle but not to UT slices (Supp. | Overall, these results identified deoxytubercidin as a phagocytosis inhibitor in organotypic slices. | (g) 3D reconstructions of representative morphological features of microglia for each tested compound. | Note the variable degrees of dendrite branching, number and lengths of processes, and soma sizes for microglia exposed to different compounds. | In the next batch, we assessed two potential engulfment enhancers that shared a mechanism of action with deoxytubercidine: thioguanosine, a purine analog used as an antineoplastic compound (De, 2023); and N6methyladenosine, an mRNA regulator involved in tumorigenesis and compound resistance (He et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2023). | Both compounds reduced apoptotic cells phagocytosis but only m6A increased the number of dead cells or microglia (Supp. | As deoxytubercidin, both thioguanosine and N6methyladenosine behaved as phagocytosis inhibitors in organotypic slices, although they did not lead to delayed apoptotic cell clearance and accumulation, possibly because the effects on phagocytosis were stronger in deoxytubercidin. | We then analyzed a compound with mixed proengulfment and antidegradation properties in the AHTS, doxorubicin, an anthracycline antibiotic used as an antineoplastic agent (Carvalho et al., 2009; JohnsonArbor Dubey, 2023). | Overall, the three compounds in this batch, and thioguanosine, N6methyladenosine, and doxorubicin behaved as phagocytosis inhibitors in organotypic slices similar to deoxytubercidine, regardless of their initial classification in the AHTS. | 18.2 1.2, p .09, with no statistically significant effect in each individual experiment), we skipped it in the rest of the compounds dissolved in DMSO (danazol, gliclazide, oxethazaine, and zoxazolamine). | In the next batch, we analyzed two compounds that were classified as proengulfment compounds in the AHTS: danazol, an antigonadotropic and antiestrogenic agent (Barbieri Ryan, 1981); and gliclazide, an antihyperglycemic compound (Khunti et al., 2020). | We then analyzed two compounds classified in the AHTS as degradation blockers: oxethazaine, a local anesthetic and antacid used to relief pain associated with the digestive system (McMillen et al., 1992; Seifter et al., 1962; Yasuhara Levy, 1988), and zoxazolamine, a centrallyacting muscle relaxant (McMillen et al., 1992; Yasuhara Levy, 1988). | Next, we assessed two compounds dissolved in methanol, maprotiline and nicardipine, that were originally classified as prodegradation and antiengulfment in the AHTS, respectively. | Maprotiline is a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor used as an antidepressant (Wells Gelenberg, 1981). | This compound increased the number of dead cells and reduced their phagocytosis, without changing microglial numbers but reducing their complexity (Supp. | These results suggest that both maprotiline and nicardipine were phagocytosis inhibitors in organotypic slices. | Finally, we analyzed compounds dissolved in water, the potential degradation enhancer dobutamine, and the engulfment blockers trifluoperazine and nafronyl, as initially classified in the AHTS. | These findings indicated that nafronyl had a toxic effect, whereas trifluoperazine behaved as an antiengulfment compound in organotypic slices. | In summary, hippocampal organotypic slices allowed us to validate some compounds identified in the AHTS and RHTS in a complex ex vivo system that maintains neuronal connectivity and microglia function. | Most compounds (deoxytubercidin, thioguanosine, N6methyladenosine, doxorubicin, gliclazide, maprotiline, nicardipine, nafronyl, trifluoperazine), regardless of their original classification in previous HTS, behaved as antiengulfment compounds at 100 μM in organotypic slices: they decreased the Phagocytic index and increased the number of dead cells. | While we have not explored the origin of this discrepancy between the effect of the compounds in cultured cells versus organotypic slices, it is likely that some differences may be related to the model system itself. | The only compounds with consistent effects between the HTS and the organotypic cultures were nicardipine and trifluoperazine, both confirmed antiengulfment compounds. | 3.4 In vivo validation of AHTS and RHTS compounds Following our bottomup strategy in the validation of microglial phagocytosis modulators, we tested in vivo the compounds with the most robust effects on the inhibition of engulfment: deoxytubercidin and trifluoperazine. | Overall, across all compounds and experiments (in organotypics and in vivo), we found a significant correlation of the Ph index with microglial numbers (Figure 7a). | To explore how phagocytosis in microglia could be addressed pharmacologically, we have employed an unbiased bottomup approach staring with a phenotypic (i.e., phagocytosis) small molecule HTS in mouse primary microglia (AHTS) and human iPSCderived macrophages (RHTS), followed by initial testing of a few hits in an organotypic hippocampal slice cultures paradigm of apoptotic cell phagocytosis, and confirmation of an effect for two compounds of interest in an in vivo paradigm of removal of apoptotic newborn cells in the adult hippocampal neurogenic niche in mice. | For the two HTS, we chose two separate chemical libraries, which contain small molecules that are wellannotated, related to their known mechanism. | Overall, our approach exemplifies that wellannotated chemical libraries can be used to discover novel modes of action for small molecules with known mechanism. | Here, we identified the antipsychoticantineoplastic trifluoperazine and the ribose derivative deoxytubercidin as inhibitors of microglial phagocytosis in our experimental setup. | These platforms have focused on microglial functions, including the expression or release of inflammatory, immunomodulatory andor neuroprotective factors (Hansen et al., 2010; Patil et al., 2021) or exovesicles (Ruan et al., 2022), or on the response to pathological protein aggregates derived from amyloid beta or alphasynuclein (Bassil et al., 2021). | In addition to the proper screening, here we also describe a complete analysis pipeline, including filtering steps for sources of variability (such as technical replicates and toxic effects); the use of a zscore to compile data from different concentrations; and validation of selected hit compounds in organotypic mouse hippocampal slice cultures and an in vivo paradigm of phagocytic removal of newborn apoptotic cells in the neurogenic niche. | 2, Timing: discriminating between engulfment versus degradation along a time course can provide additional information about the mechanism of action of the hit compounds. | 3, HTS design: we recommend including reference compounds that induce or inhibit phagocytosis (i.e., a clear and bestdefined regulator of function) or have no effect (inert, like a buffer control), commonly referred to as positive and negative controls. | It is important to note that some compounds may only show a specific mode of action at low concentrations and hit offtargets or become toxic at higher concentrations. | 5, Library diversity: the polypharmacology of the compounds and their known must be considered when selecting the chemical library. | 6, Compound cell specificity: because neurons and microglia communicate bidirectionally, some compounds may indirectly regulate microglial phagocytosis by acting on neurons, which in turn may modulate microglial function. | 7, Validation: it is imperative to validate the hit compounds in complex systems, especially in vivo or in 3D multicelltype human model systems. | 4.2 Trifluoperazine as microglial phagocytosis inhibitor Our bottomup approach and experimental setup allowed us to identify trifluoperazine as a phagocytosis inhibitor with stronger inhibitory effect at 100 μM than PSB0739, a highly specific P2Y12R inhibitor (Cserép et al., 2020). | Trifluoperazine is a phenothiazine, a firstgeneration heterocyclic antipsychotic compound that has recently been shown to display antitumoral effects as well (Kidron Nguyen, 2024). | It was also recently identified as a potential phagocytosis inhibitor in a machine learningdriven screening based on its in silico inhibitory activity of MEGF10 (Multiple EGF Like Domains 10) (Gravina et al., 2022), an astrocyteenriched receptor of the complement C1q protein that mediates astrocytic synaptic phagocytosis (Chung et al., 2013). | Our results, however, invite to speculate that the beneficial effect of trifluoperazine in cancer may be compromised if the resident phagocytes have impaired their ability to clean up apoptotic tumor cells because of the antiphagocytic effect of the compound. | 4.3 RNADNA metabolism and microglial phagocytosis Our screening also validated deoxytubercidin as a phagocytosis inhibitor in organotypic slices and in vivo, although it had been initially classified as enhancer in the RHTS. | Interestingly, the purine analog thioguanosine, and the mRNA regulator N6methyladenosine were also initially classified as phagocytosis enhancers in AHTS but were confirmed as inhibitors in organotypic slices. | In summary, we demonstrate that based on wellannotated chemical librariers one can establish phenotypic screens to identify compounds with the ability to modulate the phagocytic function of microglia in vitro and in vivo. | One reason why we detected mostly inhibitors of phagocytosis rather than enhancers could be that the cells in culture are already extremely efficient in that function and further optimization is difficult to achieve, even for iPSCderived macrophages that show a clear deficit due to a genetic predisposition (i.e., 3xSNCA). | The compounds identified in our screens are a starting point to study microglia function, which may be regulated by thus far unknown molecular mechanisms.",

      "text_block": "While there has been interest in inhibiting JNK due to its involvement in inflammatory processes and cancer, there is increasing focus on developing MAP2K7 inhibitors to enhance specificity when MAP2K7 activation is associated with disease progression. | Despite some progress, further research is needed to fully comprehend the role of MAP2K7 in cancer and assess the potential use of kinase inhibitors in cancer therapy. | This review examines the role of MAP2K7 in cancer and the development of small-molecule inhibitors. | Abnormal activation of kinases has driven the development of small-molecule inhibitors for treating diseases. | The catalytic domain contains a conserved core comprising two lobules (N-terminal and C-terminal) connected by a hinge region that defines the ATP-binding domain, which is the target of most kinase inhibitors. | Kinase inhibitors can be classified into seven types (type I-VII) based on their binding (to the active ATP-binding site, inactive ATP-binding site, or different domainallosteric) and binding mode (reversible or irreversible). | The tyrosine kinase inhibitor Imatinib (classified as type IIA) was the inaugural small-molecule inhibitor to receive approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2001. | Its successful management of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia marked a significant milestone in cancer therapy and paved the way for the development of various kinase inhibitors. | The availability of crystal structure, chemical probes, and cell-free assays for MAP2K7, a member of the STE kinase family in the kinome, facilitates the development of specific inhibitors by medicinal chemistry. | NF𝜅B activates the inhibitor GADD45β. | Although the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor Sunitinib caused cardiotoxicity in old rats, the drug led to upregulation of miR-133b and inhibition of MAP2K7 in young rats (9). | In addition to homeostatic and physiological regulation, the MAP2K7-JNK pathway can be modulated with small molecules. | Cobaltic protoporphyrin IX chloride (Rosiglitazone), an anti-diabetic medication, has a neuroprotective effect by inducing heme oxygenase that prevents the assembly of the MELK3-MAP2K7-JNK3 complex via JIP1 and thus heme oxygenase can be beneficial in cases of cerebral ischemia (18). | While this finding does not establish a cause-effect relationship, the aberrant activation of these kinases provides an opportunity to investigate the use of specific small molecule inhibitors to inhibit prostate tumor growth. | We studied the tumor suppressor function of the Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) in pediatric leukemia because we identified that KLF4 inhibits T cell proliferation during homeostasis, and it is expressed at low levels in lymphoblasts from children with T-ALL, especially in the poor prognoses of ETP-ALL and TLX groups and the inhibitory role in T cell proliferation (5052). | Pharmacological modulation of MAP2K7-JNK activity There is an increasing interest in developing MAP2K7 inhibitors not only to treat human disease but also as a tool to investigate MAP2K7 in T-ALL pathobiology. | Specific inhibitors are needed because most small molecules used to study MAP2K7, with a few exceptions, were identified as off-target inhibitors. | Although medicinal chemistry aims to increase specificity through covalent inhibition, clinical oncologists are concerned that covalent inhibitors may cause off-target toxicity. | Despite this, many kinase inhibitors used in the clinic covalently bind to the target. | Selected compounds with low IC50 were further optimized for stabilization (D-enantiomers), cell membrane permeability (replacing the N-terminal acetyl group with a benzyloxycarbonyl group), and chemical derivatization to improve bioavailability while retaining anticancer activity. | Chemical compound Specificity MAP2K7 inhibition(IC50) CytotoxicityIC50 Cancer Activity in a mouse model(dose) Ref. | DTP3 peptide Inhibits interaction of GADD45β and MAP2K7 Activation(28 nM) 17-31 nM MM (14.5 mgKg) (54) HWY336 MAP2K4, MAP2K7 Inhibition(10 μM) n.d. n.d. n.d.

and MAP2K7 kinase inhibitor in the human embryonic kidney HEK293 cell line ( Table 3 ) (55). | HWY336 competes with substrates but not with ATP via non-covalent interactions in the activation loop of MAP2K4 and MAP2K7, yet this inhibitors anticancer properties have to be investigated. | A structure-based design was conducted using the structure of an EGFR inhibitor able to inhibit MAP2K7 with low potency because pyrazolopyrimidine-based compounds inhibit EGFR, and the ATP binding pocket of EGFR is similar to MAP2K7 ( Table 3 ) (56). | The compound 4a showed the highest potency (10 nM) in a biochemical assay and inhibited MAP2K7 by covalently reacting to Cys218 at the end of the hinge region in the ATP binding domain. | Kinome studies of compound 4a revealed off-target kinases with more than 50 inhibition (e.g., BLK, BMX, BTK, ITK, JAK3, mTOR, and S6K) all containing the Cys218 in the ATP-binding pocket (56). | A recent study showed a structural analysis of MAP2K7 activation and identified small molecules with inhibitory activity (57). | Then, a small-scale screen (360 compounds) using the melting thermal shift assay identified nine compounds that could bind the flexible MAP2K7 ATP binding pocket with KD in the nanomolar range. | These compounds included type I inhibitors (e.g., Ibrutinib, OTSSP167, and CPT1-70-1) and trifluoromethyl-benzene-based type II inhibitors (e.g., HYJ2-002-1, XMD15-46, and TL10-105) (57). | Kinase assays using full-length MAP2K7-S287DT291D protein with ATP pre-incubation showed high potency for the nine identified compounds with IC50 values ranging from 60 nM to 160 nM. | The compounds that showed higher cytotoxicity in the monocytic cell line THP-1 at 1 μM concentration were OTSSP167, CPT1-70-1, and TL10-105. | This report has shed important information on the MAP2K7 structure in the inactive and active form, the flexibility of the ATP binding domain, and the inhibitory activity of Type I and Type II reversible and covalent inhibitors. | JNK inhibitors (e.g., JNK-IN-8) showed cytotoxicity in T-ALL cell lines with IC50 10 μM by inhibiting the MAP2K7-JNK pathway (58, 59). | Selective inhibition of the kinase MAP2K7 with small molecules is possible because of the distinct features of its ATP binding pocket compared to other MAP2Ks (61, 62). | 5Z-7-Oxozeaenol synergistically induces in vitro cytotoxicity with etoposide and dexamethasone, suggesting the feasibility of using this inhibitor in frontline therapy. | However, this compound failed to efficiently control leukemia in the cell-based xenograft (CBX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models due to drug toxicity that prevented achieving therapeutic concentrations in vivo (64). | We recently found that the MELK inhibitor OTSSP167 also inhibited MAP2K7 kinase activity at an IC50 of 160 nM and induced cytotoxicity in T-ALL cells at low nanomolar concentrations (IC50 10-57 nM) through inhibition of the MAP2K7-JNK pathway in T-ALL cell lines (57, 65). | Despite being a pan-kinase inhibitor, OTSSP167 targeted other pathways besides MAP2K7-JNK, such as mTOR and NOTCH1, in T-ALL cells (65). | Yet, despite being potent and well tolerated, future use of OTSSP167 in the clinic is somehow overshadowed by the potential of target toxicity due to its pan-kinase inhibitor activity. | Recently, covalent MAP2K7 inhibitors were identified in a high-throughput nanomole-scale synthesis for late-stage functionalization of acrylamide-based kinase inhibitors ( Table 3 ) (66). | Two MAP2K7 inhibitors (compounds 1 and 2), previously identified via structure-based drug discovery and virtual screening, were used to generate libraries through copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition synthesis that were screened with the in-cell western assay (phosphorylated JNK detection) using U2O2 cells (osteosarcoma) treated with sorbitol. | The generated series from compounds 1 and 2 yielded derivatives (4-amino-pyrazolpyrimidine core and indazole scaffold) with JNK inhibition capacity in the low nanomolar range (30 nM) and irreversible binding to the Cys 218 in the recombinant protein. | Although the top inhibitors in each series were selected for absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies, none of these compounds were tested in mouse models. | Finally, Scheidts group designed a novel MAP2K7 inhibitor, DK-2403, based on rational design with a streamlined one-pot synthesis (67). | In recent years, significant efforts have been dedicated to developing novel MAP2K7 inhibitors for use as research tools and potential new cancer treatments. | Among the nine small molecules with MAP2K7 inhibitory capacity described in the literature, only four were evaluated in cancer models, predominantly multiple melanoma and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and three were assessed in mouse models. | Our research group identified abnormal MAP2K7 activation in pediatric T-ALL and conducted proof-of-concept evaluations of 5Z-7Oxozeaenol and OTSSP167 compounds. | Although promising results indicated that MAP2K7 inhibition can control leukemia burden in preclinical mouse models, the compounds did not exhibit the desired high potency, high specificity, and low toxicity. | More recently, we described the design and synthesis of an irreversible MAP2K7 inhibitor, DK2403, with high specificity that has yet to be investigated in pre-clinical mouse models. | The clinical application of potent and specific MAP2K7 inhibitors in leukemia also requires optimal pharmacology and toxicology studies in animal models and pre-clinical evaluation using patient samples. | Undesired activity in the central nervous system could be minimized by decreasing the lipophilicity of lead compounds or devising delivery systems that are not permeable in the blood-brain barrier. | For all these reasons, Phase I clinical trials should examine the safety and adverse events of MAP2K7 inhibitors, particularly in cognition, cardiac function, and immunity. | Another alternative to overcome these shortcomings is repurposing existing kinase inhibitors tested in humans for new therapeutic purposes, although this would imply off-target inhibition of MAP2K7 (low potency). | A clearer understanding of MAP2K7s role in normal and disease states and the development of small-molecule inhibitors will facilitate the exploration of potential clinical applications in cancer and other diseases.",

For example, a double immunoelectron microscopy study on the rodent mPFC revealed that CB1Rs in GABAergic neurons are associated with postsynaptic mGluR5 in pyramidal neurons.50 The activation of mGluR5 plays an important role in the change in glutamatergic signaling into retrograde eCB signaling. | In the long-lasting phase of neuropathic pain, increased eCB levels lead to CB1R dysfunction, breaking the feedback loop and resulting in uncontrolled inhibitory inputs from GABAergic neurons, suppressing mPFC function and leading to depression.17 Glutamatergic neurons in the mPFC and serotonergic neurons in the prelimbic mPFC are involved in mood disorders.53 Exogenous cannabinoids such as cannabidiol (CBD) produce antidepressive effects in the prelimbic mPFC through CB1Rs and serotonergic receptors.54 These findings suggest that cannabinoid and non-cannabinoid receptors of different neurons contribute to regulating anxiety and depression following neuropathic pain. | The antinociceptive effect of activated CB1Rs in the RAIC depend on the disinhibition of GABAergic neurons and the enhanced function of the descending pain inhibitory pathway via the dorsolateral fasciculus (Figure 4A).22 Despite these varying changes in CB1Rs, the neural mechanisms underlying the analgesic effects of activated CB1Rs in the IC warrant further investigation. | The central and peripheral manifestations of anxiety and depression are mediated by CB1R and CB2R signaling, indicating that the ECS is a crucial regulator of these conditions in neuropathic pain.83 Emotional aspects of neuropathic pain, such as fear and anxiety, are processed through a neural circuit from the ventral hippocampus (VH) to the BLA.84 AEA levels in the hippocampus increased after systemic injection of the FAAH inhibitor URB597, which inhibited both depressive-like behaviors and neuropathic pain.33 This antidepressant effect is enhanced by the activation of CB2Rs and TRPV1 receptors by AEA.85 The application of PEA can indirectly increase AEA levels by acting as a false substrate for FAAH, potentially having a positive cooperative effect on neuropathic pain and related emotional disorders.86 Through double immunostaining and electron microscopy, CB1Rs of hippocampal astrocytes were identified and quantified.87 Acute application of exogenous cannabinoids triggered LTD at hippocampal CA3CA1 synapses. | Midcingulate cortex (MCC) In addition to the ACC, the MCC plays important roles in emotion, action, memory and pain.104 Nociceptive information from the anteromedial thalamic nucleus arrives at the MCC.105 In naive mice, chemogenetic activation of the MCC aggravates pain sensitivity.106 Moreover, hypersensitivity to pain is associated with the MCC-IC pathway.107 In addition, the connections between the MCC and the ZI lead to inhibitory effects.108 Poor episodic memory performance, executive function, speed and mental flexibility are associated with the MCC in Parkinsons disease patients.109 This poor performance is associated with lower CB1R levels in the MCC.109 Phytocannabinoids such as THC and CBD significantly reduce connectivity between the DLPFC and the IC.110 The distribution and physiological function of the ECS in the MCC should be explored. | Cannabis-based medicines are derived from plants and act as agonists to CBRs. The activation of CBRs by phytocannabinoids or synthetic cannabinoids may help relieve neuropathic pain.114 Pharmacological approaches such as the use of CBRs agonists, eCB-regulating enzyme inhibitors, and other interventions that modulate the ECS have been shown to relieve neuropathic pain.115 Short-term and long-term changes in ECS components in the brain can occur after neuropathic pain.",

      "text_block": "Surgery, local destructive therapy and liver transplantation are the most effective treatments for patients with early-stage liver cancer.5 Anti-tumor therapy includes molecularly targeted drug therapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, chemotherapy and so on. | First-line regimens for systemic antitumor therapy include sorafenib, tislelizumab monoclonal antibody, lenvatinib, and donafenib, and combinations include anti-PD1PD-L1 combined with intravenous anti-VEGF drugs (atezolizumab combined with bevacizumab).6 Second-line systemic anti-tumor therapies include regorafenib, apatinib, and ramucirumab.7 In addition, other second-line systemic anti-tumor treatment options include FDA approval of PD-1 in combination with CTLA4 inhibitors (nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab) for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who have progressed after prior sorafenib treatment or who cannot tolerate sorafenib.8 However, the adverse effects of antitumor therapy are numerous and are dominated by nausea, hypertension, diarrhea, malaise, and rash.9,10 With the advancement of technology, the treatment of liver cancer is also advancing. | So far, a series of natural products are being clinically evaluated against cancer, such as polyphenols, Icariin, resveratrol, silybin, saponins (ginsenoside Rg3 and glycyrrhetinic acid), berberine, and the inorganic compound arsenic trioxide. | Modern research believes that rhubarb mainly contains flavonoids, saponins, AQs and other compounds.16 After reviewing the literature, there are no reports on the anti-liver cancer effects of rhubarb flavonoids and saponins, but there are many reports on the anti-liver cancer effects of rhubarb AQs. Therefore, it is speculated that AQs should be the main anti-liver cancer substances of rhubarb. | AQs are a class of natural quinone compounds that are widely found in natural plants. | Modern research shows that AQ compounds have various pharmacological effects, such as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antioxidant, lipid-lowering, and anti-tumor etc.1721 In recent years, the anti-cancer effects of AQ compounds have been widely studied and are considered to be potential therapeutic drugs for lung cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer and other cancers. | Drugs derived from AQ compounds, such as doxorubicin (DOX), Mitoxantrone, epirubicin, idarubicin, and varubicin have been successfully used in the chemotherapy of malignant tumors and solid tumors.22 Rhubarb AQs are mainly including emodin, rhein, chrysophanol, aloe-emodin and physcion and corresponding glycosides.23 Many in vivo and in vitro experiments have confirmed that rhubarb AQs can inhibit the growth of liver cancer cells. | In addition, Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS)MS analysis found that the methanol extract of rhubarb mainly contained 16 components, including AQ, flavonoids and tannin compounds, and a total of 7 AQs were detected.25 The AQs of rhubarb include AQ glycosides and AQ aglycones. | It was found that there are currently many literatures reporting the anti-liver cancer effects of emodin, rhein, chrysophanol, physcion and aloe-emodin among rhubarb AQs. Therefore, this review mainly focuses on the anti-liver cancer effects of the above-mentioned compounds. | Table 2The Anti-Liver Cancer Efficacy of Emodin, Rhein, Chrysophanol, Physcion, and

Emodin(6-Methyl-1,3,8-trihydroxyanthraquinone) is a naturally occurring AQ compound that has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, and anti-cancer pharmacological effects.5557 With the deepening of research on emodin, emodin has also been confirmed to have a variety of hepatoprotective effects, including NAFLD, liver fibrosis, and liver cancer.58 Liver cancer will occur with the progression of NAFLD and liver fibrosis. | Kim Y S et al combined emodin (20 μM) and sorafenib and found that emodin enhances the inhibitory effect of sorafenib in HCC cells in a time-dependent manner, and it can reduce the resistance of liver cancer cells to sorafenib and synergistically increase the stasis phase of HCC cells in the G1 phase. | Its mechanism is related to emodin inhibiting the activity of SREBP-2, thereby inhibiting oncogenic AKT signaling and inactivating the oncogenic transcription factor signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3).31 The anti-liver cancer effect of new preparations made by combining emodin with other drugs is also vary significant. | For example, Li Cs research explored a new pharmaceutical compound β-dihydroartemisinin-emodin (β-DHA -emodin), which can induce HepG-2 cell apoptosis by up-regulating the expression of caspase-389 and Bax and down-regulating the expression of Bcl-2.77 In the process of treating liver cancer, cisplatin will reduce the therapeutic effect due to its drug resistance. | The Anti-Liver Cancer Effect and Mechanism of Rhein Rhein (4,5-dihydroxy-9,10-dioxoanthracene-2-carboxyli acid) is a lipophilic AQ compound with pharmacological effects of hepatoprotective, renal protective, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer and antibacterial activities.8287 The therapeutic mechanism of rhein for liver cancer mainly includes mitochondrial damage and autophagy-mediated apoptosis of liver cancer cells. | The Anti-Liver Cancer Effect and Mechanism of Chrysophanol Chrysophanol (1,8-dihydroxy-3-methylanthracene-9,10-dione) is the most abundant free AQ compound in rhubarb and has anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and neuroprotective effects.100102 There are few studies on chrysophanols anti-liver cancer effect, and its anti-liver cancer mechanism is mainly reflected in affecting the function of mitochondria. | p21 can act as an inhibitor of CDK, reducing the expression of CDK2, cyclin D and thymidylate synthase (TSase) proteins, thereby arresting Hep3B cells in the S phase.46 P21 has been shown to be a key mediator of cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, preventing the transition to G1S,103 and p27 inhibits the activation of the cyclin E-CDK2 complex and plays a key role in the progression of the cell cycle from the G1 phase to the S phase.104 In addition, Xie Yans research found that chrysophanol can induce liver cancer cells death by affecting mitochondrial function, and chrysophanol (50 μmoll, 100 μmoll) can enhance the expression of CyPD protein, which is a molecular component and regulator of mPTP and is involved in the apoptosis process of liver cancer cells.47 The mechanism of chrysophanol anti -liver cancer is shown in Figure 4. | FENG Q, etc., found that 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity (6PGD) expression is increased in different cancer tissues and can promote tumorigenesis.114 The expression of 6PGD is involved in HCC growth and survival and is considered a potential target to overcome HCC resistance to chemotherapy drugs.115 Physcion is an inhibitor of the small molecule 6PGD. | Furthermore, 6PGD inhibition significantly reduced NADP-dependent sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) enzyme activity, and the reduction of SIRT1 activity inhibited the growth and survival of HCC cells.115 Glycolysis was first discovered in HCC cells and is a hallmark of liver cancer, responsible for regulating HCC cells proliferation, immune evasion, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, and drug resistance.117 Pan X P et als study found that physcion (20 μM) could enhance the inhibitory effect of sorafenib on drug-resistant HCC cells, increase the level of miR-370 and downregulate the expression of proto-oncogene serinethreonine-protein kinase 1 (Pim-1), thereby inhibiting c- Myc-regulated glycolysis.49 Another study confirmed that combined treatment with physcion and sorafenib significantly inhibited tumor growth in mice. | Aloe-emodin has anti-cancer, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, neuroprotective and hepatoprotective pharmacological effects.118122 The anti-liver cancer effect of aloe-emodin is related to promoting the apoptosis and growth of liver cancer cells. | However, the molecular mechanism by which aloe-emodin reduces the stability of CARP mRNA in cells remains to be further explored.54 Kuo P L showed that aloe-emodin (10 µgmL, 20 µgmL) has an inhibitory effect on both human liver cancer cell lines HepG2 and Hep 3B. | In addition, aloe-emodin inhibited DNA synthesis in HepG2 cells by upregulating the tumor suppressor p16 and inhibiting Retinoblastoma (Rb) phosphorylation, and reduced cell migration by upregulating the transfer of the inhibitor nonmetastatic protein 23 (nm23).51 P-Rb plays an important role in controlling cell cycle progression and cell growth.123 The PI3K-AKT signaling pathway is closely related to cell growth.",

leucine-rich repeat sequences; NACHT: NAIP (neuronal apoptosis inhibitor protein), CIITA (class II transactivator), HET-E (invariant chain of the MHC class II), and TP1 (telomerase-associated protein); NLRC4: Nod-like receptor and caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 4; NLRP: Nod-like receptor and pyrin domain-containing protein; PYD, pyrin domain The initiation of inflammasome activation varies among different cell types, sensors, stimuli, and pattern recognition (Fig. | For instance, adaptor proteins such as ASC, can facilitate the aggregation of inflammasome components, while inhibitory proteins can impede this process . | In addition, directly blocking the microglia-mediated transformation of astrocytes into the A1 neurotoxic phenotype leads to neuroprotective effects. | Similarly, treatment of α-Syn mice with an NLRP3 inhibitor reduced the insoluble aggregation of α-Syn and ameliorated the loss of dopaminergic neurons . | The use of NLRP3 inhibitors in R62 mice reduces NLRP3 activation and ROS production, rescues neurons, and reduces microglial activation , which support the role of NLRP3 in HD. | However, in another study, acetylsalicylic acid and rofecoxib failed to show neuroprotective effects in the N171-82Q and R62 transgenic HD mouse models . | They may exert a neuroprotective effect in the early stages by removing damage and promoting repair in response to CNS injury. | In the hippocampus of EAE mice, both microglia and the NLRP3 inflammasome are activated, and treatment with an NLRP3 inhibitor can suppress the activation of both . | Research has shown that treatment of EAE animals with a caspase-1 inhibitor improves neurobehavioral performance, reduces the severity of neuropathology, and decreases inflammatory molecular markers. | Glycoprotein non-metastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB), a transmembrane glycoprotein that has been shown to prolong the survival of SOD1G93A mice, has been found to exert its neuroprotective effect through reducing astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation in a CD44-dependent manner . | In a recent study, acute treatment with an NLRP3-specific inhibitor did not reduce spinal cord inflammation in SOD1G93A mice, suggesting that multiple inflammasomes may be activated in ALS and that inhibition of NLRP3 alone may not be sufficient to block inflammation . | Inflammasomes as pharmacological targets Inflammasomes play a critical role in neurodegenerative diseases, leading to the discovery or development of many compounds targeting them for pharmacological intervention (Table 1). | Currently, the most widely used and gold-standard compound for NLRP3 inhibition is MCC950 (also known as CRID3). | MCC950 is a specific inhibitor that can block both canonical and non-canonical pathways of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. | Glyburide also inhibits NLRP3, caspase-1, and IL-1β in macrophages and may be used as an inflammasome inhibitor to treat NLRP3-related inflammatory diseases . | CY-09 is an inhibitor that specifically blocks the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. | Other inflammasome inhibitors, such as BAY 117082 and PARTHENOLIDE, can target NLRP3 by inhibiting its atpase activity. | However, they are not specific for NLRP3, as they can also target AIM2, NLRC4, and NLRP1 , suggesting diverse effects of these inhibitors. | Other NLRP3 inhibitors such as BOT-4-one and INF39 have not been tested in neurodegenerative disease models.Table 1Overview of pharmacological compounds targeting inflammasomeCompound nameMechanism of

inhibiting NLRP3 initiation and assembly, there are inhibitors that target other components of the inflammasome. | Inhibition of caspase-1 has been shown to effectively ameliorate cognitive impairment in AD mice , suggesting that caspase-1 inhibitors have potentials to be used for neurodegenerative diseases. | IC100, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits ASC oligomerization, has been found to attenuate inflammatory responses in the EAE model and exert considerable therapeutic potential, suggesting potentials of ASC inhibitors for neurodegenerative diseases . | Some inhibitors target downstream effectors of the inflammasome, such as IL-1, to suppress inflammation. | Necrosulfonamide, an inhibitor with a similar mechanism as disulfiram, has been found to reduce neuroinflammation and rescue dopaminergic neuronal degeneration in the MPTP model . | There are some inhibitors that have already undergone clinical trials for ulcerative colitis, acute gout attacks, osteoarthritis, cytokine release syndrom in COVID-19, cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome, and advanced cancer (combined therapy) (Table 2). | Most of the trials tested NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors with a primary aim of reducing inflammatory factors. | The pharmacodynamic data can be used to determine whether the NLRP3 inhibitor ZYIL1 can improve ALS symptoms. | At the same time, for diseases like AD and PD, where there is substantial evidence that inflammasomes play an important role, there are fewer related clinical trials.Table 2Inflammasome inhibitors in clinical developmentCompound nameDevelopment

searched from clinicaltrials.gov. | Some small molecules that inhibit inflammasome activation or assembly have been experimentally used to alleviate neuroinflammation in these diseases. | However, there are also small molecules that cannot cross the bloodbrain barrier and are therefore not applicable to these diseases. | This highlights the need to focus on compounds with both inhibitory potential and potential for modification, with the goal of identifying compounds that can modulate inflammasome activation without causing side effects or off-target activities. | Another strategy is to develop inhibitors that target multiple pathways, such as combinational therapies that simultaneously target different aspects of the inflammatory process, potentially providing more effective control of neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases. | However, this approach requires careful considerations of compound specificity, ability to cross the bloodbrain barrier, and the overall impact on disease progression.",
