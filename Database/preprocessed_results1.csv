11579448.xml,Gene therapy for glaucoma: Targeting key mechanisms,"Neuroprotective strategies explored include targeting neurotrophic factors and their receptors, reducing oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, and preventing Wallerian degeneration. | Despite the effectiveness of multiple topical drops when used correctly and the development of new IOP lowering medications, such as the Rho Kinase inhibitor Netarsudil (Khouri et al., 2019), adherence to dosing schedules poses a significant challenge, resulting in poor compliance that limits the real-world effectiveness of these treatments (Newman-Casey et al., 2015, Okeke et al., 2009). | While neuroprotection offers a distinct advantage by targeting the ultimate cause of sight loss, the retina is a more immunogenic environment compared to the anterior chamber of the eye (Hori, 2008). | Neuroprotective approaches include increasing levels of neurotrophic factors, reducing oxidative stress, and inhibiting Wallerian degeneration. | For this purpose, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) exhibit a similar expression pattern to MMPs, with the ratio of the two groups of proteins determining the extent of ECM deposition (Tektas and Lütjen-Drecoll, 2009, Overby et al., 2014). | Furthermore, perfusion of ocular tissues with MMPs or MMP-activating compounds leads to increased outflow facility (Bradley et al., 1998, Pang et al., 2003, Webb et al., 2006, Groef et al., 2013). | Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is another regulator of MMPs and has been shown to increase MMP-9 and MMP-13 expression after ocular injection. | Intracameral injection of ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 in rabbits has been shown to decrease IOP in a dose dependent manner, with a corresponding increase in outflow facility (Honjo et al., 2001). | Animal models of ocular hypertension display reduced anterograde and retrograde axonal transport of neurotrophic factors, indicating that pathological increases in IOP may lead to RGC death via trophic insufficiency (Quigley et al., 2000, Pease et al., 2000). | 3.2 Targets 3.2.1 Targeting neurotrophic factors and their receptors Neurotrophins are a family of proteins that support the survival, growth, and differentiation of neurons and include nerve growth factor (NGF), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), among others. | Given the potential role of BDNF signalling in glaucoma development, its application as a neuroprotective agent has been explored. | However, this approach has limited clinical application due to the need for multiple injections for lasting neuroprotection. | Consequently, gene therapy-based strategies have been investigated for their potential to provide more durable neuroprotective effects. | Additionally, supplementing BDNF protein once was effective in compensating for the slow onset of AAV-mediated gene expression and rescued a larger number of RGCs. While these studies demonstrate the neuroprotective potential of BDNF expression from the retina following viral transduction, this approach comes with potential drawbacks. | Secondly, overexpression of BDNF may lead to an accumulation of immature proBDNF, and its binding to p75NTR receptors, which are associated with apoptosis and may counteract neuroprotection (Teng et al., 2005). | In a mouse optic nerve crush model, it provided greater neuroprotection than AAV2-BDNF or AAV2-TrkB alone. | Additionally, AAV2 TrkB-2A-mBDNF demonstrated neuroprotective effects in a rat model of laser-induced ocular hypertension (Osborne, Khatib, et al., 2018). | Intravitreal injection of AAV2-iTrkB was shown to be neuroprotective in a mouse model of normotensive glaucoma (glutamateaspartate transporter (GLAST) KO mice), a silicon oil model of ocular hypertension, and an optic nerve crush model. | Considering this, the potential of antioxidants as neuroprotective molecules has been explored. | This therapy provided significant neuroprotection of both RGC soma and axons, and preserved visual function in both a mouse optic nerve crush model and the silicone oil-induced ocular hypertension model. | The neuroprotective capabilities of these approaches were compared to germline knockout of Sarm1 in both an optic nerve crush model and a silicone-oil induced ocular hypertension model. | Most gene therapies aimed at reducing IOP target the TM, while neuroprotection-focussed therapies target RGCs. Thus, many studies have focussed on determining the ideal vector for delivering genetic cargo to these tissues. | Additionally, it was demonstrated that a truncated form of the mSncg promoter, while slightly less RGC specific, could be packaged into an AAV2 vector to drive expression of a CRISPRCas9 system to knockdown pro degenerative genes Ddit3 and Sarm1, providing significant neuroprotection in an optic nerve crush model (Wang et al., 2020). | (2017) demonstrated that transgene expression driven by the Mcp-1 promoter can target stressed RGC cells specifically and shows equivalent transgene expression to the CMV promoter, while reducing stress and death in healthy RGCs. Advancing the development of such targeted promoters could significantly enhance the efficiency of gene therapies for neuroprotection in humans. | Gene therapy strategies for glaucoma can be broadly classed into those aimed at reducing IOP and those aimed at providing neuroprotection to RGCs. As most glaucoma is a multifactorial disease, gene therapies aim to target common pathways underlying these hallmarks of disease. | Neuroprotective strategies target common RGC degenerative pathways such as neurotrophic factor deprivation, oxidative stress, and Wallerian degeneration.","G (MISC)"

In Figure 7, we provide a hypothetical model incorporating the results presented here with published findings showing the NMDARTRPM4 complex as the target for novel actions of drugs that act on TRPM4 in neurons. | showing that TRPM4 forms a complex with NMDARs, and that this complex is disrupted by BPN, the most reasonable explanation for this result is that the formation of the NMDARTRPM4 complex markedly potentiates ion flux through activated NMDARs. Because the inhibition of INMDA by BPN was not dependent on TRPM4mediated Na flux, we predicted the selective TRPM4 inhibitor NBA would have no effect on NMDAevoked i responses. | The significance of the effects of Bic, and more generally the cocktail containing TTX, CNQX, and Bic, is that long incubations in buffers containing these channel blockers, which are often used to isolate currents through NMDARs, produce a timedependent inhibition of NMDAevoked Ca2 influx that occludes the inhibitory effects of BPN. | The TRPM4 inhibitor 9phenanthrol improved outcomes following cerebral edema . | The novel NMDARTRPM4 interface inhibitors appear to avoid these adverse effects because the NMDARTRPM4 complexes are predominately extrasynaptic . | Understanding how TRPM4 affects metabotropic relative to ionotropic NMDAR signaling might guide the use and development of neuroprotective agents. | We found that NMDARTRPM4 interface inhibitor BPN inhibited Ca2 flux through NMDARs providing a mechanism for the neuroprotective effects of BPN.","ABS (ORG), N (MISC), ##D (MISC), N (MISC), NMDAR (MISC), NMDAR (MISC), ##nex (ORG), NMD (MISC), N (MISC), ##A (MISC), N (MISC), ##C (MISC), N (MISC), Na (MISC), N (MISC), N (MISC), N (MISC), TRP (MISC), N (MISC)"

inhibitors Wortmannin and LY294002 had no effect . | Administering c-MET inhibitors prevented MACC1-driven cell migration in lung cancer and the induction of Akt and VEGF CD by MACC1 in GC . | Aside from upregulating c-MET kinase or suppressing PTEN, MACC1 seems to directly interact with YWHAE (143-3 epsilon), a newly identified activator of PI3KAkt signaling . | In fact, the Activator protein 1 (AP-1)c-Jun-mediated MACC1 regulation inspired a continuous quest for the development of specific inhibitors of MACC1, which has identified the very commonly used statin drugs as well as identification of novel MACC1 inhibitors to restrict metastasis formation . | Furthermore, the NF-κB pathway mediates HGFc-MET-dependent proliferation and tubule formation, and involves the phosphorylation of inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK) and the activation of its effector p65 . | Importantly, cell-death resistant cancer cells can repress the expression of this receptor through modulation of the Janus kinase (JAK)signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway . | Exposure to the JAK-inhibitor ruxolitinib can prevent the induction of Mcl-1 and thereby restores Fas-ligand-dependent apoptosis in CRC cells . | Of note, by systematically applying small molecule inhibitors targeting c-Met, Akt and mTOR in GC cells, a connection between MACC1 and c-METAktmTOR

driven cancers might be of therapeutic value . | studied the effect of parecoxib on MACC1 expression level and found that this anti-inflammatory compound can inhibit MACC1 gene expression. | Another study identified novel tetrazolo-pyridazine based small molecules from a high-throughput screen as effective MACC1 transcriptional inhibitors. | These novel compounds inhibit MACC1 gene expression in a dose-dependent manner, leading to a reduction in migration and wound healing capabilities in CRC cells and reduced metastasis formation in mice. | The inhibition of the NF-κB pathway was proposed as a possible mode-of-action of these compounds, however this novel approach needs further evaluation . | The MEK1 inhibitors AZD6244 and GSK1120212 reduced MACC1-induced metastasis formation in xenografted mouse models by decreasing the MACC1 tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by MEK1 . | The effect of MEK1 inhibition has also been shown in the context of esophageal and gastric adenocarcinomas with the MEK1 inhibitor selumetinib, effectively reducing the migratory properties of cancer cells and metastasis formation in MACC1 xenografted mouse models . | demonstrated that the GPX4 inhibitor RSL3, was able to downregulate MACC1 gene expression at the mRNA and protein level as well as reduce the expression of GPX4 in CRC cells . | Next to the great potential of SMIs to reduce MACC1 expression or function, several naturally occurring compounds have been shown to affect MACC1 gene expression. | Conclusively, natural compounds possess the capacity to affecting MACC1 expression levels but additional research is needed to further understand the mechanism by which these compounds facilitate their inhibition on MACC1 and to evaluate their feasibility to supplement modern anti-cancer therapies. | Surprisingly, treating CRC cell lines with the proliferation inhibitor mitomycin abolished the MACC1-associated effect on the collective migration speed, indicating that targeting proliferation in MACC1high expressing tumors might allow additional effects on cell migration . | In addition, chemotherapy can be combined with other treatment modalities such as RT, kinase inhibitors and surgery. | Some examples of targeted therapies are growth factor receptor inhibitors (e.g. cetuximab) or kinase inhibitors (BRAF or MEK inhibitors) that downregulate hyperactive pathways leading to reduced cell growth. | Moreover, MACC1 gene expression can be inhibited by different small molecules. | This finding together with inhibitor studiesincluding clinically approved molecules (AZD6244, selumetinib; GSK1120212, trametinib)pointed to an intimate connection of the MAP kinase pathway and MACC1. | This directly led to the idea of combining statins with MEK1 inhibitors. | This led to the identification of niclosamide as S100A4 inhibitor that acts via the β-cateninTCF4 transcription activating complex . | Among 118.500 compounds, tetrazolo-pyridazine based small molecules were identified as the most promising primary hits. | After structureactivity relationship (SAR) experiments, most effective compounds were validated for their ability to reduce MACC1 gene expression and cell motility in vitro and metastasis formation in vivo. | Unlike the statins, the newly identified compounds act via the NF-κB pathway . | Since it was shown, that the MACC1 gene expression can be induced via TNFαNF-κB the combination of the new compound and niclosamide was tested in vitro. | This testing revealed a synergistic efficacy of the novel compounds targeting MACC1

11586835.xml,Protective Activity of Melatonin Combinations and Melatonin‐Based Hybrid Molecules in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Pharmacological therapies synergistically targeting multiple pathogenic pathways, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation, are prime candidates for neuroprotection. | Then, we review the literature investigating the efficacy of melatonin combinations with approved or investigational neuroprotective agents and of melatonincontaining hybrid molecules, both in vitro and in animal models of AD, PD, and MS, as well as the efficacy of addon melatonin in clinical settings. | We conclude that a better characterization of the mechanisms underlying such melatonin synergistic actions under neuroinflammation at appropriate doses needs to be tackled to advance successful clinical translation of neuroprotective melatonin combination therapies or melatoninbased hybrid molecules. | Therefore, combinations of melatonin with other neuroprotective agents have been investigated, pointing to a synergistic or additive effect in the context of a multitargetdirected strategy often pursued in neurodegenerative diseases characterized by a multifactorial nature. | Two kinds of combinations were investigated: (i) combination of melatonin with neuroprotective agents, either approved drugs or substances with mechanisms supporting a neuroprotective effect (e.g., antioxidant, metal chelator, etc.); (ii) melatoninbased hybrid compounds merging melatonin structure with that of other antioxidant and neuroprotective molecules. | These drawbacks could be mitigated using a single multifunctional compound, acting on two or more targets at the same time, for which druglike properties can be optimized. | Compared to drug combinations, these compounds may offer the advantage of reduced side effects and pharmacokinetic complexity, and fewer drugdrug interactions. | Notably, multitarget compounds could suffer from a challenging optimization of physicochemical properties and pharmacokinetic profiles. | We also mention the major controversies related to the use of melatonin as a neuroprotective agent, mostly generated by the lack of a common consensus for the optimal dosing, molecular targets, and toxicity. | 2 Mechanisms of MelatoninMediated Cell Protection Melatonin neuroprotective activities include cell protection from oxidative stress, regulation of energy metabolism, and modulation of the innate immune system. | It is reported that melatonin exerts neuroprotective actions both directly on neuronal cells and indirectly through the modulation of glial cell activities . | Under pathological conditions, some melatonin effects may persist even in the absence of MT1 and MT2 receptors or upon their pharmacological blockade, indicating the existence of melatonin receptorindependent mechanisms, as observed in studies evaluating the neuroprotective activity of melatonin . | Moreover, in vitro studies performed in transfected HEK293 cells have shown that melatonin receptors may be desensitized by internalization when exposed beyond 1 µM melatonin, suggesting that nonreceptordependent mechanisms or indolecompoundbased actions may be relevant when high concentrations of melatonin are given . | The development of selective melatonin receptor ligands, the characterization of melatonin receptorselective KO mice, and the identification of the phenotype of brain cells expressing melatonin receptors under pathological conditions using wellcharacterized antibodies (for discussion see ) will be instrumental to establish and validate the role of melatonin receptors in neuroprotection. | The MT2selective antagonist 4phenyl2propionamidotetralin (4PPDOT) was able to prevent the activation of the Nrf2 pathway and the neuroprotective actions afforded by 1 μM melatonin in vitro, against erastininduced ferroptosis in neuronal hippocampal HT22 cells, and by 10 mgkg melatonin (i.p.), in vivo, against the spinal cord injury . | Melatonin mitochondrial effects can be mediated by the activation of membrane receptors, of SIRT1 and SIRT3 pathways, and downstream signaling molecules such as peroxisome proliferatorinitiated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC1α), adenosine 5monophosphateactivated protein kinase (AMPK), and Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) . | At 1 mM concentration, melatonin inhibited LPSinduced chemokine expression and secretion in BV2 cells , reduced cyclooxygenase2 expression in murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 , downregulated the inducible NOS M1 marker, and upregulated the antiinflammatory M2 markers arginase 1 (Arg1) and the mannose receptor CD206 through signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation in primary microglia cultures . | 4 Melatonin Combinations Melatonin has been evaluated in combination with several molecules claimed as neuroprotective to assess whether the combination could attenuate the progression of neurodegenerative disorders to a greater extent than a singleagent treatment. | Combinationhybrid compound Disease condition or experimental model of disease Treatment Outcome References Melatonin memantine AD modelAPPPs1 mice Melatonin: 6 mgkgday (po) memantine: 10 mgkgday (po) Duration: 32 days Improvement in episodic memory and reduction of amyloid aggregates compared to the drugs alone. | Melatonin ergothioneine AD modeldgalactosetreated mice Melatonin: 10 mgkgday (po) ergothioneine: 0.5 mgkgday (po) Duration: 88 days Synergistic

reduction of Aβ2535induced working memory deficits compared to the reference HDAC6 inhibitor and melatonin alone or in combination. | Melatoninferulic acidHDAC inhibitor hybrid 16 AD modelAPPPs1 mice 50 mgkgday (po) Duration: 12 weeks Improvements in reduction of Aβ brain accumulation and synaptic degeneration, with antiinflammatory and antioxidant activities. | In vitro assays were performed on human SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cell line to evaluate whether melatonin in combination with the AChE inhibitor galantamine could protect against mitochondrial oxidative stress induced by rotenone and oligomycinA exposure. | The involvement of nicotinic and melatonin receptors in the neuroprotective mechanism was assessed through pharmacological antagonism studies with mecamylamine and luzindole, respectively, which fully reversed the beneficial effect on the AD model . | In an in vitro N2aAPPswe cell culture AD model, AD biomarkers were evaluated following treatment with melatonin (30 μM) in combination with naturally occurring compounds resveratrol (10 μM), vitamin B12 (40 μM), and epigallocatechin3gallate (20 μM). | Supplementation with melatonin and ergothioneine in combination at the same dose as used alone produced an additive or synergistic neuroprotective effect on learning and memory deficits. | Starting from the results of previous studies which demonstrated a potentiated antioxidant effect produced by the combination of the MAO inhibitor selegiline with melatonin in an autoxidation model of dopamine in solution , an in vivo PD model, obtained by treating mice with 1methyl4phenyl1,2,3,6tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), was used to understand the effects of melatonin and selegiline alone and in combination on animal behavior. | On this basis, combination of the PDK4 inhibitor diisopropylamine dichloroacetate (DADA) and melatonin (50 and 10 mgkg, respectively, Table 1) was evaluated in the EAE model, aiming at the minimization of melatonin side effects. | The strategy pursued in the design of multitarget compounds generally relied on the exploitation of the antioxidant properties of melatonin that was combined with other antioxidant agents or with compounds with different, potentially synergistic activities. | In light of the potential receptormediated activity, we focused on compounds characterized by the indolylethylamide structure of melatonin. | On the other hand, multitarget indole derivatives devoid of the ethylamide side chain and connected to molecular portions from other neuroprotective agents (e.g., trientine , donepezil , sulforaphane , have also been described. | The amino group of tacrine was connected to the amide side chain of melatonin (e.g., compound 2, Figure 1) which represents the preferred site for melatonin modification in hybrid molecules . | Compounds from this series also inhibited Aβ selfaggregation and exerted neuroprotective properties in human neuroblastoma cell line SHSY5Y against cell death induced by various toxic insults . | Furthermore, compound 2 produced a significant decrease of Aβ deposits with a reduction of Aβinduced cell death in organotypic slice cultures and alleviation of behavioral impairment, with recovery in memory and cognitive function, in amyloid precursor proteinpresenilin 1 (APPPs1) transgenic mice (2 µL, 50 µgmL, Table 1). | Compound 3 (Figure 1) showed an enhanced antioxidant profile (ORAC assay) compared to the parent compounds, suggesting a synergistic effect between the components of the hybrid molecule. | Compound 3 displayed higher activation of the Nrf2 transcriptional pathway than melatonin and neuroprotective activity against Aβ peptides and other toxic stimuli in SHSY5Y cells . | The lipoic acid derivative 4 (Figure 1) exhibited improved antioxidant activity compared to melatonin (ORAC assay), potently induced Nrf2 transcriptional pathway, being approximately twofold more potent than melatonin, and exerted neuroprotective activity on SHSY5Y cell line counteracting H2O2 cytotoxic insult . | The 2chromone ring is the core fragment of several monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, which reduce the formation of neurotoxic H2O2 and ROS species . | Hybrid compound 5 (Figure 1) was characterized by moderate cholinesterase and MAO inhibitory activity and showed antioxidant properties comparable to those of melatonin (ORAC assay). | Hybrid compound 6 (Figure 1) showed reversed cholinesterase selectivity compared to the parent donepezil, being more potent against BuChE than AChE, greater ROS scavenging ability than melatonin (ORAC assay), chelating ability, moderate inhibition of Aβ142 selfaggregation, and higher neuroprotective effect against H2O2induced cell death on PC12 cell line than melatonin. | The benzylpiperidine fragment was also linked to position 5 of the indole ring of melatonin via a carbamate group, as in compound 7 (Figure 1) which showed improved selectivity toward BuChE, expressed at high levels in advanced AD . | Another anticholinesterase scaffold exploited for the design of hybrid compounds was benzylpyridinium bromide, which was installed on melatonin side chain giving 8 (Figure 2), a potent hAChE and hBuChE inhibitor with greater antioxidant activity than melatonin (ORAC assay) and neuroprotective effect against H2O2induced damage in neuroblastoma SHSY5Y cell line comparable to that of melatonin . | The N,Ndibenzyl(Nmethyl)amine fragment of the AChE inhibitor AP2238 was inserted on the amide side chain of melatonin, looking for hybrid compounds with anticholinesterase, antioxidant, neuroprotective, and neurogenic effects. | These compounds had reduced AChE and BuChE inhibitory activity compared to tacrine and antioxidant activity in the same range as melatonin (ORAC assay). | They also showed good levels of neuroprotection in SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cell line and were more potent than melatonin to stimulate early neurogenesis and cell maturation into a neuronal phenotype of rat hippocampal primary neuronal stem cells . | ITH91IQM157 (9, Figure 2) exerted neuroprotection in SHSY5Y cells in which cytotoxicity was induced by a combination of Aβ and okadaic acid to reproduce markers of both beta and tau pathologies. | It demonstrated greater neuroprotective activity than the combination of subeffective concentrations of melatonin and donepezil. | Melatonin receptors appear to be involved in the neuroprotective mechanism since the antagonist luzindole significantly reduced the protective effect . | Berberine and ()meptazinol are other cholinesterase inhibitors linked to the amide side chain of melatonin to combine enzyme inhibition with the antioxidant and antiAβaggregation activities of melatonin . | Another interesting hybrid derivative was based on functionalization of melatonin amide side chain with a pseudoirreversible carbamate BuChE inhibitor, selective over AChE which is less involved in the later stages of AD . | Insertion of a sixmethylene linker led to compound 12 (Figure 2) with reduced potency toward BuChE but increased duration of action, significantly protecting murine hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells from glutamate neurotoxicity. | Compound 12 reduced LPSinduced microglia inflammation and exhibited immunomodulatory activity, promoting a switch from neurotoxic M1 to neuroprotective M2 phenotype in N9 microglial cells, with improved activity compared to melatonin. | Compound 12 reduced Aβ2535induced learning deficits and protected longterm memory in mice at very low dosage (0.1 mgkg, Table 1), with significantly higher in vivo efficacy than the parent BuChE inhibitor . | The multitargetdirected ligand 13 (Figure 3) was obtained, merging melatonin and ferulic acid into the structure of a selective phenylhydroxamic acidbased HDAC6 inhibitor. | The neuroprotective activity of compound 13 was assayed in a mouse model of AD (Table 1), where it attenuated Aβ2535induced working memory deficits at a lower dose (0.3 mgkg) than the reference HDAC6 inhibitor (1 mgkg). | In the same experiment, melatonin (0.16 mgkg) and an equimolar (0.7 μM) mixture of the three parent compounds were ineffective. | The inclusion of a chelating portion and a cholinesteraseinhibiting carbamate on melatonin structure was investigated to obtain a multitarget, multifunctional synergistic effect for the treatment of AD, leading to compounds exemplified by the 8aminoquinoline derivative 15 (Figure 3). | However, the most protective compounds on HT22 cell line were the phenolic precursors, devoid of the carbamate group . | To enhance the efficacy of melatonin, hybrid compounds with other antioxidant agents were also devised. | Incorporation of the βdiketone moiety of curcumin resulted in compounds represented by derivative ZCMI1 (16, Figure 3) which showed neuroprotection in a cellular AD model (MC65 cells that conditionally overexpress the 99residue carboxylterminal fragment of the amyloid precursor protein) . | Interestingly, the hybrid compound was protective at 0.3 µM concentration, at which melatonin, curcumin, and their combination showed no effect. | The neuroprotective activity was mainly related to the potent intracellular antioxidant effect, as hybrid 16 reduced the production of Aβ oligomers with low potency and did not inhibit Aβ42 fibrillization. | In vivo studies demonstrated that compound 16 given orally at doses of 50 mgkg for 12 weeks (Table 1) decreased Aβ brain accumulation, exerted antiinflammatory and antioxidant activities in APPPS1 mice, and significantly reduced synaptic degeneration. | Since Nrf2 activation is known to regulate antioxidant and antinflammatory responses, melatonin scaffold was decorated with potent Nrf2 inducers to obtain hybrid compounds with multitarget activity for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. | This hybrid derivative exerted neuroprotective activity in two models of oxidative stress in SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells and in oxygen and glucose deprivation models in rat hippocampal slices, with higher efficacy than melatonin . | Within a similar multitarget strategy, compound 18 (Figure 3) showed antioxidant properties and Nrf2inducing activity. | It exerted a neuroprotective activity against toxic stimuli in SHSY5Y cells comparable to that of reference compounds melatonin and rasagiline . | Valproic acid upregulates melatonin receptors and neurotrophic factors. | The dualacting compound UCM1341 (20, Figure 3) combines fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitory activity with agonist activity at melatonin receptors. | At 10 µM concentration, it exhibited greater neuroprotection against a neuroinflammatory insult (INFγ LPS) in hippocampal slice cultures than the reference FAAH inhibitor URB597 and melatonin alone at the same concentration, and comparable to that of the combination of the two agents. | Counteracting neuroinflammation, compound 20 enhanced the levels of anandamide and oleoylethanolamide, prevented TNFα release, and upregulated the expression of PPARα. | The neuroprotective effects of 20 were prevented by PPARα, TRPV1, and melatonin receptor antagonists, confirming a receptordependent mechanism for the melatonergic component. | Overall, melatonin was merged with (or with a portion of) neuroprotective agents acting according to a variety of mechanisms, spanning from enzyme inhibition (e.g., cholinesterase, HDAC, and FAAH) to metal chelation and antioxidant activity. | In fact, despite the consolidated role of receptor engagement in the neuroprotective activity of melatonin, very few hybrid molecules (9 and 20) were assayed for their affinity and behavior at MT1 and MT2 receptors, limiting the characterization of their molecular mechanism, which should represent an indispensable requisite for the rational combination of multiple activities. | In fact, hybrid compounds described so far appear more as proofofprinciple pharmacological tools than optimized drug candidates, with in vivo evaluation limited to few compounds and no investigation of biopharmaceutical properties and pharmacokinetic profile. | In fact, several works had shown that compounds lacking a 5methoxy group, such as in the Nacetyltryptamine fragment, can provide interesting combined effects in neuroprotective assays. | Comparing the activities reported for couples of unsubstituted and methoxysubstituted hybrids, a very limited effect can be ascribed to the methoxy group which generally produces a slight increase in the antioxidant activity measured in the ORAC assay and a moderate reduction of cholinesterase inhibitory activity. | The characterization of mechanisms and interpretation of activity of hybrid compounds is complicated by the choice of the cell models used for compound evaluation since the expression of melatonin receptors in cells used for assays is taken into consideration only for compounds 9 and 20. | The better performance of hybrid compounds compared to melatonin might be due to an effective synergistic activity, but also to a difference in the expression of the targets of melatonin and the combined agent. | Additionally, the superior behavior of hybrid compounds versus the combination of single drugs still needs to be verified, both in animal models and in a clinical setting. | 6 Conclusions The multifactorial pathogenesis of AD, PD, and MS has prompted the investigation of drug combinations and hybrid compounds with multiple mechanisms as diseasemodifying treatments. | It has also been included in hybrid molecules, fused with compounds exerting similar activities (e.g., antioxidant, Nrf2 inducer) or with no overlapping mechanisms. | In the latter case, different signaling pathways are activated, even if the same target can be affected by both merged portions, as observed for melatonin fused with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors binding the peripheric anionic site and the catalytic site, respectively. | Overall, most combinations and hybrid molecules produced an improvement in diseaserelated biological markers and animal conditions compared to singleagent treatment, with synergistic effects recorded for combinations with both approved drugs and natural compounds. | In the field of neurodegenerative diseases, the use of melatonin in clinical protocols for the treatment of AD and MS (see above) reveals the interest of developing new hybrids which can provide the neuroprotective and sleeppromoting activities of melatonergic agents combined with other favorable mechanisms. | This approach is particularly intriguing when some form of synergism is shown for the two mechanisms, such as in the case of melatonin receptor agonistsFAAH inhibitors, where melatonin receptor activation stimulates the expression of PPAR, and FAAH inhibition enhances PPAR activation . | Even if no hybrid compound is still in the clinical phases for neurodegenerative disease, it is important that precompetitive research provides new pharmacological tools to investigate the therapeutical potential of combined approaches.","ABS (ORG), Alzheimers (MISC), AD (MISC),

Like our 1st gen approach, 2nd gen kiCCA utilizes kinobeads, also known as multiplexed inhibitor beads (MIBs), for affinity purification of the kinome from native cell and tissue lysates, combined with a competitive binding assays using our library of broad-selectivity kinase inhibitors (KIs) that we named kinase interactome probes (KIPs).23, 3439 The competitive binding assay is followed by shotgun nano liquid chromatography (nLC)-MS analysis to determine competed kinases and non-kinase proteins. | We show (1) that kinobead AP-MS with diaPASEF increased the analytical depth of the assayable kinome, which we exploited to determine the kinome-wide selectivity of four clinical anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors, and (2) that 2nd gen kiCCA increased the number of observable kinome PPIs by 6.1-fold compared to our 1st gen approach, which we utilized to determine signaling pathways and therapeutic targets that promote neuroblastoma (NB) cell phenotypic plasticity. | NB cell phenotypic plasticity can promote therapy resistance and metastasis in high-risk NB, allowing cancer cells to transdifferentiate from a noradrenergic neuronal-like phenotype to a more mesenchymal-like phenotype.4246 For instance, the noradrenergic-mesenchymal transition (NMT) has been shown to increase NB resistance to ALK inhibitor and chemotherapy,47, 48 and to modulate the response to disialoganglioside GD2-targeted immunotherapy.49, 50 Accordingly, pharmacological strategies to reverse the NMT, and thereby reduce metastasis and therapy resistance, are urgently needed. | Furthermore, we show that inhibiting these pathways with selective kinase inhibitors can disrupt the opposing NMT phenotypes. | To clarify if the increased analytical depth of diaPASEF-powered kinobead AP-MS can identify unreported kinase inhibitor targets, we profiled the kinome selectivity of the 1st gen ALK inhibitor crizotinib, the 2nd gen ALK inhibitor ceritinib, and the 3rd gen ALK inhibitors entrectinib and lorlatinib.54 Several ALK inhibitors are approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) that carry ALK gene fusions.55 Furthermore, the ALK gene is affected by gain of function mutations in 14 of high-risk NB cases, and ALK inhibitors like lorlatinib are being tested in clinical trials against high-risk NB.56 A better understanding of ALK inhibitor target profiles in NB cells will help determine their mechanisms of action, optimize treatments, and avoid off-target toxicities. | TNK1 has recently been shown to promote tumor growth and autophagy, and MAP4K2 and MAP2K6 activate the JNK and p38 branches of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling that can confer therapy resistance to cancer cells.62, 63 Collectively, our results identified previously unreported off-targets of clinical ALK inhibitors, whose inhibition may contribute to their clinical efficacy in NSCLCs and NBs. 2. | These included kinases controlling neuronal growth, differentiation and survival like the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptors type 1 and 2 (NTRK1 and 2), cell polarity like the MAPmicrotubule affinity-regulating kinases 14 (MARK14), and cell migration like the myosin light chain kinase (MYLK, Fig. | To test our target hypotheses, we treated the SH-SY5Y (noradrenergic neuronal-like) and SK-N-SH (mesenchymal-like) cell lines with the selective CK2 inhibitor SGC-CK21 and the selective TBK1 inhibitor GSK8612 for four days.77, 78 To determine inhibitor effects on NMT pathways, we then performed global MS-based proteome analysis; this showed that CK2 inhibition significantly altered the expression of 3,202 proteins in the SH-SY5Y cell line (40 of the proteome) and the expression of 2,147 proteins in the SK-N-SH cell line (26 of the proteome), whereas TBK1 inhibition did not alter protein expression in the SH-SY5Y cell line, but significantly altered the expression of 708 proteins in the SK-N-SH cell line (8.5, Table S2, two sample students t-test, BH-FDR 0.05, N 4 and N 3). | In contrast TBK1 inhibition significantly decreased migration in SK-N-SH cell lines, as did dasatinib, a broad selectivity inhibitor of Src-family kinases which served as our positive control (Fig. | DISCUSSION Here, we demonstrated that diaPASEF-powered kinobead AP-MS and 2nd gen kiCCA are versatile and efficient MS-based chemoproteomic tools for kinome interaction profiling, which includes kinase-inhibitor and kinase-protein interactions. | Specifically, we showed that diaPASEF kinobead AP-MS identified previously unreported kinase targets of clinical ALK inhibitors that may explain their mechanism of action and clinical efficacy. | Thus, lorlatinib may inhibit kinases that are involved in JNK and p38 signaling, and in autophagy (TNK1), all processes that have been shown to promote therapy resistance in vivo.62, 63, 79 Lorlatinib is the ALK inhibitor that has progressed the furthest in clinical trials against high-risk NB to date,56 and has the most off-target kinases of all ALK inhibitors that we tested. | Collectively, this suggested that the polypharmacology of lorlatinib is critical for its clinical efficacy, and that more efficient inhibitors with engineered polypharmacology could be developed utilizing the insights that we obtained. | Drugs and concentrations used were the TBK1 inhibitor GSK8612 (2 μM final, Mechem Express, MCE), the CK2 inhibitor SGC-CK21 (2 μM final, MCE), and dasatinib (100 nM final, MCE). | Then, the TBK1 inhibitor GSK8612 (2 μM final, MCE), the CK2 inhibitor SGC-CK21 (2 μM final, MCE), or DMSO (vehicle control) were added. | Kinase affinity enrichment, KI competition, and on-bead digestion of proteins Kinase affinity enrichment, KI competition, and on-bead digestion of proteins was performed as previously described.23 In addition to the 21 KIPs, the following kinase inhibitors were used as the competitors for soluble competition experiments at the given final concentrations: lorlatinib (1 μM final, MCE), entrectinib (1 μM final, MCE), crizotinib (1 μM final, MCE), and ceritinib (1 μM final, MCE). | Alternatively, we applied a simple p 0.05 (validation mode in kinobead and Co-IPMS data).23 Plotting STRING interaction networks PPI network models were plotted using the STRING web application version 12.0 with the following settings: Edges were scaled with confidence, and only physical subnetwork interactions were considered, i.e., only considering text mining, experiments, and databases.82 Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) For gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we used the ssGSEA2.0 script in R together with the Gene Ontology: Biological Process (GOBP) gene set of the MSigDB database (c5.bp.v7.0.symbols) according to the published protocol with the following minor modifications:83 to rank gene names, we calculated a compound score using the two sample Students t-test log2 MS intensity difference multiplied by the log10 p-value.","E (MISC), N (MISC)"

El-Shehawy et al. | A dilution of 150 µL of compounds was added in quadruplicate to each well after the incubation, and the wells were kept at 37 C with 5 CO2 for 48 h. | Dose-dependent assay The compounds were analyzed using MTT assay data. | The selected compounds and vitamin C were evaluated at corresponding concentrations, following the methodology outlined in a prior study (AlBalawi et al. | SARS-CoV-2 antiviral potential evaluation To examine the antiviral potential of the selected compounds, we used an in vitro pre-post-infection approach, treating cells after and before virus adsorption for 1 h, respectively. | After that, the compounds were prepared in dilutions selected based on a cytotoxicity test and added to the monolayer of cells (50 µL well) for 1 h. | After pre-treatment, 50 µL of DMEM supplemented with 2 FBS was added to each well, the compound was removed, and the virus inoculum was added at 0.01 multiplicity of infection. | Quantification of cytokines in propolis-treated cells supernatants To investigate the effects of the selected compounds on cytokine production, we focused on propolis due to its observed antiviral activity and potential immunomodulatory properties in the previously infected Vero CCL-81 culture supernatants. | A t-student test and one-way ANOVA were followed by Tukeys post-hoc test to compare the effects of different compound concentrations on the control groups. | Results Cytotoxicity assay to figure out the non-cytotoxic dose for all compounds A concentration range of 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, and 1.56 µgmL were tested to identify the compounds cytotoxicity dose. | Neither 6.25 nor 12.5 µgmL of the compound asserted injury to the monolayer; however, higher concentrations induced morphological alterations, notably rounding and loss of adhesion. | This data indicated that the compounds have a threshold concentration below which they are not toxic, and higher concentrations can cause cellular damage. | To test the antiviral potential of the compounds versus SARS-CoV-2, concentrations of 6.25 and 12.5 µgmL were selected. | Additionally, MTT assays were performed on all compounds to assess cell viability. | 1Tests on Vero CCL-81 cells for cytotoxicity of the selected compounds. | After 48 h of treatment with the chosen compounds at five different concentrations, Vero CCL-81 monolayers were analyzed for viability. | The graphs revealed that the selected compounds have a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on Vero CCL-81 cells, with the highest concentration of each compound resulting in mild low cell viability. | This indicated that these compounds could be potentially used as anti-COVID-19 agents. | It was noted that different doses of the compounds resulted in significantly different viability levels in Vero CCL-81 cells. | Based on the dosage effects of the compounds administered to varying dosages for 48 h, 0.5 fraction inhibition (Fa) was observed, and dose effect values were tabularized in (Table 2), which evaluated dosage reduction and the impact of the compound. | The graph revealed that the compounds had varying effects on cell viability, with the highest concentration of the compound resulting in the highest Fa. Table 2 also exhibited that as the dose of the compound decreased, the Fa decreased, indicating that the compounds had dose-dependent effects on cell viability.Fig. | 2A doseeffect plot and a median-effect plot are revealed in the CompuSyn graphs for the selected compounds: A Doseeffect plot; B Median-effect plot. | The doseeffect plot revealed that the combined effects of propolis and curcumin are greater than those of either compound alone. | The median-effect plot also revealed a non-linear relationship between the two compounds, indicating that the two compounds have a strong synergistic effect. | Pro, Que, Gin, and Cur are abbreviations for propolis, quercetin, ginseng, and curcumin, respectivelyTable 2Dose-dependent of the different compounds on Vero cell growth after 48

found to significantly reduce the amount of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the Vero CCL-81 supernatants compared to the untreated control. | Propolis compounds exhibited a notable decrease in viral titer at concentrations of 100 and 50 µgmL, according to (Fig. | This suggested that the compounds could interfere with the viral replication cycle by directly inhibiting the virus or stimulating the immune system. | Both compounds effectively reduced the virus at concentrations as low as 50 µgmL, indicating they are likely effective for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections. | This could be due to the low solubility of these compounds, which prevents them from being effectively absorbed into cells at lower concentrations. | This revealed that RVD is highly soluble and can easily penetrate cells, making it an effective antiviral agent at lower concentrations than the other compounds.Fig. | 3SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity of different compounds in Vero CCL-81. | SARS-CoV-2 levels in supernatants of

vaccines against the zoonoses, but also because new SARS-CoVs may re-emerge, posing a threat to public health (Ahmad 2021). | The antiviral RDV acts as a protease inhibitor to inhibit the MPro protein (Bafna et al. | The naturally occurring compounds found in natural products are effective against inflammation and viral infections, such as SARS-CoV-2, a newly emerging viral infection. | SARS-CoV-2 and host-cell targets resisted various natural compounds and derivatives (Merarchi et al. | This suggested that these natural compounds could be used to develop effective antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2. | Additionally, these compounds could be combined with other antiviral drugs to increase their efficacy (Zhang and Liu 2020). | To gain insight into the effectiveness of natural treatments widely used in these regions, this study examined the antiviral activity of four natural compounds used by indigenous people in Tabuk, Saudi Arabia, to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related symptoms. | Our results revealed that, at higher concentrations, the compounds displayed no significant cytotoxicity, confirming their safety for in vitro use. | This indicated that these compounds are safe for laboratory studies and possible candidates for further research. | Furthermore, these compounds could be used to develop potential therapeutic agents (Zia et al. | The primary objective of the antioxidant experiment in our study was to evaluate the antioxidant potential of the selected natural compoundspropolis, curcumin, quercetin, and ginsengsince oxidative stress plays a crucial role in the progression and severity of viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2 (Delgado-Roche and Mesta 2020). | Therefore, compounds with strong antioxidant properties, like those tested in our study, may reduce oxidative damage and inhibit viral replication indirectly by reducing the cellular environment conducive to viral propagation. | By demonstrating significant antioxidant activity through ABTS, FRAP and CUPRAC assays, we aimed to show that these compounds can neutralize free radicals, which could reduce the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. | These antioxidant effects may complement the compounds direct antiviral activity by targeting viral replication and modulating the excessive immune and inflammatory responses seen in severe COVID-19 cases (Mrityunjaya et al. | Beyond its direct antioxidant effects, propolis contains various bioactive compounds, such as flavonoids, phenolic acids, and terpenes, which possess anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties (Magnavacca et al. | In vitro, our study found that the four selected compounds had antiviral potential versus SARS-CoV-2. | Our antiviral tests were successful when we used 6.25 µgmL of each compound. | Comparatively to the positive control, the antiviral assay results showed complete inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 using 50100 g of all compounds. | This suggests that the compounds are inhibiting the virus rather than simply preventing it from replicating. | This further reinforces the idea that these compounds may be effective antiviral treatments for COVID-19. | This could be explained by propolis containing compounds such as flavonoids and phenolic acids (Kurek-Górecka et al. | As a result, we designed our study to test how propolis (the most effective in vitro antiviral compound in our study) affects Vero cells in healthy and diseased states. | Interestingly, our compounds significantly inhibited the growth of SARS-CoV-2 based on in vitro compound screening. | To

is common to use inhibitors that suppress specific cellular defense responses. | These inhibitors help identify the drugs target because when the right inhibitor is used with melittin, the pathway

applied inhibitors of ERK, JNK, p38, Akt, and HO-1 synthesis proteins with their respectively concentrations. | These inhibitors were used in previous research to determine target of interaction for

implemented signalling pathway inhibitors, 3D docking models, and pull-down assays to show that melittin activated the Nrf2HO-1 pathway. | Pathway inhibitors highlighted the key role of HO-1. | The evidence demonstrated that melittins initial action primarily involves enhancing HO-1 gene expression, occurring much earlier compared to the subsequent improvements in neurotrophic factors (BDNF and

(PKC or CaMK) . | This recovery is crucial for maintaining neuronal integrity and function, further highlighting melittins neuroprotective effects . | This experiment utilized a range of inhibitors to block potential pathways associated with Nrf2HO-1 activation. | These inhibitors help identify the drugs target because when the correct inhibitor is used, it shares the same target as the drug candidate, thus slowing down the pathway that the drug activates. | Consequently, the drug becomes less effective, indicating that it was acting on the pathway, which was indicated by the respective inhibitor . | Interestingly, despite their roles, inhibitors of these four pathways fail to replicate the inhibition effect of the HO-1 synthesis inhibitor in effectively blocking melittins cellular

As AKT plays a critical role in normal cell physiology, particularly in glucose homeostasis, off-target effects continue to be problematic, even with CAAIs and allosteric inhibitor treatment;

in liver damage, hepatocyte death, inflammation, and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, leading to STAT3 activation in surviving hepatocytes, which can potentially lead to their

different pathways . | Resistance to AKT inhibitors in breast cancer, for example, can be caused by TSC12 loss, which activates mTORC1 and blocks apoptosis in a BAK-dependent manner, even with a reduced level of phosphorylated AKT, possibly by mTORC1-mediated translational control of Mcl-1, and can be overcome by combining AKT inhibitors with an Mcl-1 inhibitor . | Moreover, the PI3K-AKT pathway has been implicated in resistance to chemo- and radiotherapeutic agents , necessitating the combination of endocrine therapy, targeted therapy, or chemoradiation with AKT inhibitors (reviewed in ). | Another problem with these pan-AKT inhibitors is that there is a need for complete understanding as to how they exert their effects since some have been shown to inhibit one isoform over another preferentially. | As an example, GSK2142795 inhibits AKT2 more potently than AKT1 or AKT3, and another pan-Akt inhibitor, GSK2110183, showed more potent inhibition of AKT1, using in vitro kinase assays containing purified AKT1, AKT2, AKT3, and a GSK3α peptide substrate. | Lastly, aside from the AKT1-specific inhibitor A-674563 and the AKT2-specific inhibitor CCT128930 (both ATP-competitive inhibitors), most AKT inhibitors lack isoform specificity, and isoform-specific treatments should be tailored to the cancer in question for reasons mentioned above. | Like pan-AKT inhibitors, it is not entirely clear what the mechanism of action of A-674563 in tumor cells is since it increased (PRAS40) or had no effect (GSK3β) on the phosphorylation of substrates shared by all AKT isoforms, although it is expectedly decreased the phosphorylation of FOXO1 . | Moreover, mesenchymal-type gastric cancer cell lines were found to be sensitive to agents targeting the PI3KAKTmTOR pathway , suggesting that GC can be targeted with AKT inhibitors. | Data obtained from phase II studies of AKT inhibitors in molecularly selected GC patients found limited clinical benefit, however, along with significant toxicities , although, in the umbrella VIKTORY (targeted agent eValuation In gastric cancer basket KORea) trial, which classified metastatic gastric cancer patients based on the presence of 10 different biomarkers and assigned patients with PIK3CA mutations and wild-type PIK3CA to combination therapy with capivasertib and paclitaxel, the treatment arm with PIK3CA mutations derived significant anti-tumor benefit, with an ORR of 33.3 in second-line GC, compared to the low response rate ( 15) in the PIK3CA wild-type group . | This suggests that optimization of the therapeutic efficacy of AKT inhibitors in GC can be attained using a biomarker-based approach, which will require further investigation in additional phase IIIII clinical trials. | Increasing the therapeutic window of AKT inhibitors: future challenges and novel approaches to targeting AKT Impaired glucose tolerance resulting from pan-AKT inhibition can be overcome by adding metformin treatment regimens, especially since metformin has anti-oncogenic effects, based on the results of prior studies . | Recently, the cholesterol-lowering drug pitavastatin was shown to synergize with AKT inhibitors in killing of triple-negative breast cancer cell lines, organoids and xenografts, but not ER-positive cell lines and organoids . | Newer approaches developed for targeted protein degradation (TPD) to date have taken advantage of the ubiquitin-proteosome system (UPS) and autophagylysosome degradation systems present in eukaryotic cells, the list of which includes PROTACs , molecular glues, Trim-Away , tag-targeted protein degraders , specific and non-genetic inhibitors of apoptosis protein-dependent protein erosive agents (SNIPERs) , autophagy-targeting chimeras (AUTACs) , lysosome-targeting chimeras (LYTACs) , and autophagosome tethering compounds (ATTECs) . | The benefits of using PROTACs far surpass those of traditional AKT inhibitors: heterobifunctional degraders tend to exhibit significantly prolonged effects compared with AKT inhibitors, as their pharmacological effects depend on the re-synthesis rate of the protein of interest and not target occupancy. | INY-03041 is a pan-AKT degrader composed of the ATP-competitive AKT inhibitor, GDC-0068, conjugated to an E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate adaptor recruiter; INY-03041 was demonstrated to have significantly prolonged effects on downstream signaling and enhanced potency, which may explain its superior anti-proliferative effects . | To overcome these issues, a wholly new and specific approach to targeting RNA, the ribonuclease-targeting chimeras (RIBOTACs) came to the forefront, fusing small molecules with RNA binding ability to a 25-linked tetra-adenylate conjugate, similar to oligoadenylates produced by cells in response to a viral infection, for RNAse L recruitment, thus converting any inert RNA-binding small molecule into a bioactive RNA degrader, i.e., the RIBOTAC . | Another disadvantage inherent to RIBOTACs is the difficulty in finding small molecules that bind selectively to the RNA molecule of interest . | Although pan-AKT inhibitors can theoretically negate these effects, they are not without problems, as previously discussed. | The POI ligand binds to the POI, and the E3 ligand recruits E3 ligases to the POI to ubiquitinate and mark the POI for degradation by the proteosome system.Development of INY-03-041, a pan-AKT degrader derived from the ATP-competitive AKT inhibitor, GDC-0068, conjugated to lenalidomide, which recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate adaptor, CRBN.Development of MS21, a VHL-recruiting, pan-pAKT targeting PROTAC derived from the ATP-competitive inhibitor, AZD5363, which reduced both cell and tumor growth in mutant PI3K-PTEN and wild-type, but not mutant, KRASBRAF cell lines, by destabilizing AURKB and arresting cells in the G2-M phase.Development of MS15, a pan-AKT, allosteric inhibitor-based PROTAC, which potently and selectively degraded AKT, and inhibited the growth of both PI3K-PTEN and KRASBRAF-mutant cancer cells.The discovery of additional pan-AKT targeting, VHL-and CRBN- recruiting PROTACs, MS143, MS98, MS5033, and MS170 using SAR, which inhibited AKT downstream signaling and cancer cell proliferation. | Another advantage is that nanoparticles themselves can be conjugated to aptamers for targeted delivery; Gonzalez-Valdivieso and colleagues devised a docetaxel and AKT peptide inhibitor recombinant fusion-containing elastin-like recombinamer (ELR) vehicle, which was conjugated to a DNA aptamer that specifically recognizes the tumor marker, CD44, to selectively target colorectal cancer cells . | The approach of using an anti-CD47 and anti-PDL1 antibody pair conjugated to the surface of a nanoparticle encasing a PI3K-AKT-mTOR inhibitor, proved to be more efficacious in reducing tumor burden in a non-small cell lung cancer immunocompetent mouse model, compared with current approaches using a PDL1 inhibitor . | Designing isoform-specific drugs having mutant or allele selectivity, such as inhibitors that target AKT1 E17K (https:www.rcsb.orgstructure8uw9), can potentially result in an even greater reduction in off-target effects, similar to drugs targeting the mutant form of PI3Kα, which delayed the onset of rash and hyperglycemia in patient-derived tumor xenograft models . | Combining an AKT inhibitor with a lysosomotropic agent in AKT-hyperactivated cells to block autophagy is another therapeutic strategy that may warrant further investigation. | This was corroborated when it was observed that treating cells with an AKT inhibitor and chloroquine, a lysosomotropic agent that blocks autolysosomal digestion, resulted in an increase in apoptotic nuclei, caspase-3 activation and an increase in the size of autophagic vesicles. | Interestingly, the authors observed an increase in mitochondrial superoxide and cellular ROS levels upon treatment with AKT inhibitors alone, which was resolved shortly after that, whereas co-treatment with chloroquine resulted in sustained ROS generation. | Chromatin modifiers, such as lysine methyltransferase inhibitors and histone deacetylase inhibitors, may prevent the activation of AKT via post-translational modification. | Utilizing HSP90 inhibitors that occupy the ATP-binding pockets of these proteins can shorten the half-life of AKT and decrease its expression, which is noteworthy from a therapeutics perspective (reviewed in ). | Biomarkers predicting sensitivity and response to AKT inhibitors Previously, numerous clinical trials were undertaken to try to identify biomarkers of sensitivity and response to AKT inhibitors, but the outcomes have been mixed, and there appears to be a discord between alterations in the PI3K-AKT pathway and response to AKT inhibitors. | Until recently, the only reliable predictive biomarker of sensitivity to most ATP-competitive inhibitors but not allosteric inhibitors, was the AKT1 E17K missense mutation, based on the results of a multi-histology basket study of capivasertib in patients with advanced gynecologic, ER-positive breast cancer, and other solid tumors . | The number of AKT mutant alleles displaying sensitivity to ATP-competitive inhibitors (capivasertib) has now been expanded to include a slew of non-E17K (missense) activating AKT12 mutations, resulting from small in-frame duplications (indels) that induce structural conformations in AKT different from activating missense mutations and activate the PI3K-AKT pathway to a much greater degree. | Cells with AKT in-del mutations showed heightened sensitivity to ATP-competitive inhibitors compared to activating missense mutations, which showed a varied response to allosteric and ATP-competitive inhibitors. | Interestingly, cells expressing AKT1 and AKT2 in-del mutants were resistant to allosteric inhibitors, likely due to the structural displacement of this drug class at the PH-kinase interface induced by the in-del mutation. | In an agnostic clinical trial initiated by the same investigators, it was found that patients with different tumor lineages harboring rare activating AKT1-3 mutant variants, including but not limited to activating in-dels, responded to capivasertib, broadening the list of biomarkers that predict sensitivity to ATP-competitive inhibitors . | who showed that the mutant lysine in AKT1 E17K can be targeted by a covalent allosteric salicylaldehyde-based inhibitor that recruits endogenous Zn2; by sparing collateral AKT2 inhibition, it is anticipated that this isoform-specific and mutant-selective inhibitor will result in decreased side effects, including hyperglycemia, in patients . | Conclusions and future perspectives It is the authors opinion that the war on hyperactivated AKT in cancer will be best waged in the future using a combination of AKT degraders, preferably those with isoform-selectivity, in a cancer-type and context-specific manner, and immunotherapy, in the form of CAR-T cell therapy (with ex vivo manipulation of CAR-T cells by targeting specific isoforms), or immune checkpoint inhibitors, which, in theory, can subdue tumor cells and boost tumoral immunogenicity by overriding the immunosuppressive TME. | In addition, the advancement of drugs, such as capivasertib, to phase III trials means that AKT inhibitors, despite their shortcomings, have the potential to have a positive impact on breast cancer and potentially other cancer types and offer a glimmer of hope to patients living with the disease, who will now be able to reap the benefits of this drug. | In addition, we believe that the recent development of a mutant-specific allosteric inhibitor will be a game-changer in the field of AKT therapeutics. | Thus, despite the many challenges, the future of AKT inhibitors in the oncology clinic is bright.","AK (MISC), B (MISC), PI3K

Target engagement and mechanism of action Tubulin-targeted chemotherapy has been highly successful, and the various marketed drugs are based on natural products scaffold, including cyanobacterial compounds.17,18 Tubulin heterodimers, composed of α-and β-subunits, form polarized polymers and these microtubules are involved in cellular structure, cell division and proliferation, motility, and intramolecular trafficking.17,1921 Binding of pharmacological agents affects the tubulin dynamics and ultimately leads to anticancer activity.22 Tubulin agents are categorized based on their binding site at αβ-tubulin or the dimer interface and whether they stabilize or destabilize microtubules. | Sites known to be targeted by marine cyanobacterial compounds are in orange. | 2) was originally isolated from the Indian Ocean sea hare Dolabella auricularia,34 but in 2001 the true producer was identified as a marine cyanobacterium, taxonomically classified in 2015 as a new genus Caldora penicillata.3436 The compound (1a) has been isolated from cyanobacteria collected from Micronesia, Hawaii and Florida.34,35,37 Dolastatin 10 (1a) showed exquisite potency at the cellular level against cancer cells in the picomolar range (10100 pM), notably with an IC50 of 0.03 nM for L1210 leukemia, 0.059 nM for small cell lung cancer NCI-H169, and 0.5 nM for human prostate cancer DU-145 cell lines.28,3840 Dolastatin 10 reached Phase II clinical trials but was discontinued due to granulocytopenia and neutropenia at dose-limiting toxicities.41 The synthesis was achieved in various ways but always following a sequential elongation approach that was amenable to structure diversification, leading to TZT-1027 (1b) and monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE, 2a), which advanced to clinical trials (Fig. | The Jouin group proposed the discrepancies were due to the lack of purity from the originally isolated compound and the lack of diastereomeric purity of an intermediate from Pettits synthesis of dolastatin 15.105 The more purified synthetic product had slightly better activity than the isolated dolastatin 15 against the U.S. National Cancer Institutes P388 lymphocytic leukemia cell line (ED50 of 0.48 ng mL1vs. | Similar to cevipabulin that targets two different sites on the tubulin dimer,31,130 GB1 promotes proteasome-mediated tubulin degradation but by an unknown mechanism, presumably distinct from that of cevipabulin.27 Comparison with GB1 (37a) indicated that cevipabulin binds to the same tubulin region although the binding mode is distinct.130 Cevipabulin almost exclusively interacts with α-tubulin, including nonexchangeable GTP.130 In contrast, GB1 (37a) makes extensive contact and hydrogen bonding with both α- and β-chains of tubulin.22 GB17 (37a37g) showed excellent solubility and much higher than that of paclitaxel.31 Hepatic microsome stability was shown to be excellent, while human cytochrome P450s were not inhibited, and plasma binding was minimal with high free fractions.31 Passive permeability was predicted to be high based on parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) for GB16.31 2.6. Repurposing as HIF inhibitors Dolastatins 10 (1a) and 15 (26a) as well as gatorbulin-1 (37a) were discovered (or re-discovered) as agents with differential antiproliferative activity against hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) containing HCT116 cells, following deconvolution of initial differential selectivity for parental HCT116 cells versus dual HCT116HIF1αHIF2α knockouts.25,91,131 The screening system, described in 2016 to aid early-stage drug discovery by providing selectivity already in primary assays, enables the prioritization of agents that have a higher likelihood of activity and selectivity against solid tumors driven and characterized by oncogenic KRAS and hyperactivation of HIF (Fig. | 11).131 It was demonstrated that microtubule agents belonged to the compounds with greatest differential, which was later proven for dolastatin 15 (26a) and gatorbulin-1 (37a).25,91 HIF inhibition appears to be a common downstream effect of tubulin-targeting agents as exemplified by multiple studies.25,91,131133 The dual effect of tubulin-binding to interfere with tumor vascularization largely in endothelial cells, and HIF-inhibition to downregulate target genes such as VEGFA in growth factor secreting cells suggests that these compounds are also promising antiangiogenic agents, in addition to its primary utility as antimitotic agents.134,135 Downregulation of the HIF-target gene, VEGFA in parental HCT116 cells was observed in cancer cells for dolastatin 15 (26a) and gatorbulin-1 (37a) and both were effective in angiogenesis assay in vitro model systems using endothelial cells.25,91 Further, validation of HIF-regulated downstream effects by tubulin agents was demonstrated in vivo using a zebrafish model specifically in vhl mutants with activated (constitutively active) HIF signaling.91 Dolastatin 15 showed strong in vivo antiangiogenic effects concomitant with HIF target gene downregulation (Vegf and Egln3) that was revealed by in situ hybridization.91 Fig. | Inhibitors of cotranslational translocation: Sec61 inhibitors 3.1. Mechanism of action Cancer cells are usually characterized by overexpression andor mutation of certain membrane proteins that function as pro-growth signaling receptors, depending on the tissue and cell type, and increased levels of secretion of ligands that act on these receptors.138,139 Both types of proteins, including receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and growth factors, rely on a functional secretory pathway for proper localization on the cell membrane and extracellular milieu, respectively.140,141 Synthesis of proteins destined for secretion starts at cytosolic ribosomes and the firstly synthesized N-hydrophobic sequence (signal peptide) is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP) for subsequent docking at the SRP receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where protein synthesis continues (Fig. | 12).144 Targeting Sec61 may ultimately prevent ER translocation of all or a subset of proteins, depending on the specific compound and cellular context, which produces a potent antiproliferative effect.145 Two anticancer natural product classes from marine cyanobacteria, apratoxins146,147 and coibamides,148,149 have been demonstrated to act via this mechanism, by targeting Sec61.150161 The different binding sites are hypothesized based on differential resistance to Sec61 mutants cells to apratoxin (45a) and coibamide A (52).145 (Fig. | 13) Recently, high-resolution cryo-EM structures of seven inhibitors bound to chimeric human-yeast Sec61, including apratoxin F (45d), were characterized to bind to the lateral gate.145 These inhibitors have shown to induce different pharmacological fingerprints in the NCI-60 cell line screens.149,155,159,162,163 Fig. | 12 Cotranslational translocation inhibition into the endoplasmic reticulum using Sec61

mechanism of action was revealed, demonstrating apratoxin A an inhibitor of cotranslational translocation, a novel strategy to inhibit cancer cell growth at low nanomolar concentrations.156 The translocon Sec61 was shown to be the direct protein target of apratoxins, exemplified by using apratoxins A (45a) and F (45d) binding near the luminal plug domain (Fig. | 12).145,157 The cryo-EM structure with F (45d) and other (non-cyanobacterial) Sec61 inhibitors suggested a common binding pocket for those Sec61 inhibitors (Fig. | In vivo studies with apratoxin S4 (45e) showed potent activity in a HCT116 colorectal cancer xenograft model.159 Daily dosing with 0.25 mg kg1 produced a pronounced antitumor effect in mice with certain RTKs as pharmacodynamic markers shown to be selectively downregulated in the tumors.159 Pharmacokinetic studies for apratoxins A and S10 both showed enrichment in the pancreas and a favorable PK profile.147,168 Apratoxin S10 (45g), like apratoxin S4, lacked irreversible toxicity and at low doses apratoxin S10 showed efficacy in an orthotopic patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model for pancreatic cancer, which is the gold standard in the field.168 At a dosing schedule of 0.25 mg kg1 every other day, apratoxin S10 inhibited the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells in vivo, without inducing cytotoxicity, thus separating antiproliferative from cytotoxic activity.168 This effect may in part be attributed to the inhibition of growth factor and cytokine secretion from tumor-associated stromal cells that drives pancreatic cancer cell growth, suggesting that apratoxin S10 has an additional indirect effect on pancreatic cancer cells and therefore address a resistance mechanism.168,169 This finding on other cell types, coupled with the novel mechanism of action, opened up avenues for application beyond cancer.168,169 Apratoxin S10 was shown to inhibit the secretion of proangiogenic factors, VEGF-A and IL-6, and consequently evaluated for activity against cancer cells derived from highly vascularized tumors (renal, colon, neuroendocrine), where the compound showed 2000- to 5000-fold greater activity than FDA approved RTK inhibitors.169 The dual activity as inherent anticancer and antiangiogenic is particularly intriguing, as the compound may also address the resistance to antiangiogenic therapy through the inhibition of multiple proangiogenic pathways and inhibiting cancer cell growth simultaneously. | The antiangiogenic activity in vitro has been determined for apratoxins A, S4 and S10 using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).155,163,169 To extend the scope of cancers that may be targeted by this compound class, apratoxin S4 (45e) was profiled against panels of cancer cells characterized by differential sensitivity to RTK inhibitors due to receptor mutations, oncogenic KRAS mutations, or activation of compensatory pathways.163 Apratoxin S4 (45e) was active at low-nanomolar to sub-nanomolar concentrations against panels of lung, head and neck, bladder, and pancreatic cancer cells, concomitant with downregulation of EGFR and other RTKs.163 Interestingly, the compound shows a differential substrate selectivity in cellular settings that was not anticipated based on biochemical studies.157 The selectivity was most pronounced in breast cancer cells, where apratoxin S4 preferentially downregulated HER3 over HER2. | Importantly, in contrast to known EGFR inhibitors, apratoxin S4 (45e) showed antiproliferative activity in mutant KRAS background, extending the application to addressing resistance to these selective targeted therapies.163 Apratoxins also differentially modulate cancer-related membrane proteins other than RTKs, including CUB-domain containing protein (CDCP1), a transmembrane protein linked to metastasis and invasion, forming a complex with EGFR to decrease cell adhesion.163 CDCP1 is also activated by KRAS but strongly downregulated by apratoxin S4 in a breast cancer cell type dependent manner. | Like apratoxins, coibamide A inhibits VEGFA and decreases expression of VEGFR2, as indicative of Sec61 inhibitors.177 However, as discussed above, comparative analysis of resistance mutations indicated differences in binding and pharmacological consequences, including cell type sensitivities.176,177 Coibamide A, originally, demonstrated potent cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-231 (GI50 2.8 nM), SNB-75 (GI50 7.6 nM), HL-60(TB) (GI50 7.4 nM), and LOX IMVI (GI50 7.4 nM) with good selectivity for breast, CNS, colon, and ovarian cancer cells.148 In a more recent study, these lariat depsipeptides demonstrated excellent inhibition of cell growth of six breast cancer cell lines in the nanomolar EC50 range, with MDA-MB-231 being the most sensitive (EC50 7.42 nM).158 In an effort to further define the sensitivity of coibamide A to breast cancer types, including triple negative breast cancer, HER and ErbB proteins indicated the depsipeptide suppressed all four HER protein expression and EGFR, exhibiting cell death as a function of exposure and concentration.148 However, endogenous HER2 was partially resistant to coibamide A (similarly shown for apratoxins)163 within the same concentrations of all HER proteins, indicating broad acting Sec61 inhibitors are not equally effective across all HER proteins,148,178 consistent with data for apratoxins.163 Yao group completed the total synthesis of the proposed structure in 2014.179 Using a liquid-phase and strategy, they constructed each fragment

nM), prostate cancer (PC3; IC50 2.6 nM), ileocecal colorectal adenocarcinoma (HCT8; IC50 2.1 nM), and ovarian (SK-OV; IC50 4.5 nM) cancer cell lines.214 Recently, the structural revision of lagunamide C (75c) by the Kigoshi group revealed the lagunamide C is the identical to odoamide.218 Odoamide (75c) is structurally similar to lagunamide A (75a), differing only by a single methylene, and was isolated from the Okinawan cyanobacterium Okeania sp. | The compound showed potent cytotoxic activity (IC50 100 nM) against several solid tumor cell lines (HeLa IC50 23 nM; CaSki IC50 68 nM; HT1080

zinc-dependent isoforms (HDAC111) with different selectivity profiles have been approved for the treatment of various lymphomas (T-cell lymphomas, multiple myeloma) but have not shown significant clinical efficacy against solid tumors.235,236 HDAC inhibition leads to hyperacetylation of histones, open chromatin structure and activation of gene expression, including genes encoding cell cycle inhibitors and pro-apoptotic proteins, which mainly or at least partially account for the anticancer activities of pharmacological HDAC inhibitors.237 Recent reviews have highlighted the importance of these targets for therapeutic applications.235,238 (Fig. | 25) To date, two HDAC inhibitors have been identified from marine cyanobacteria: (1) largazole (122a, Fig. | 25 Class I HDAC inhibitors regulate histone deacetylation through HDAC 1, 2, and 3, therefore activating gene expression, but also possess cytoplasmic (non-nuclear) targets that promote anticancer activity, including modulation of the E-cadherin complex and consequent cellcell adhesion. | characterized the HDAC selectivity as HDACs 1, 2, and 3 selective over HDAC6.239 Importantly, largazole (113a) showed solid tumor activity in a HCT116 colorectal cancer xenograft mouse model at 5 mg kg1, correlating with the histone hyperacetylation status at that dose, so that the antitumor effect was attributed to gene expression changes due to HDAC inhibition.244 Although to a lesser extent than tubulin agents dolastatins 10 and 15 (Sections 2.2, and 2.3), largazole also showed greater efficacy in HCT116 cells containing oncogenic KRAS and selectivity for HCT116 cells containing functional HIF transcription factors.131 Largazole phenocopied the colgate 1 zebrafish mutant and inhibited HIF-induced angiogenesis in vivo in vhl mutant zebrafish, but also to a lesser degree than dolastatin 15 (Section 2.3).131 Largazole (113a) is a prodrug that is activated by protein-assisted hydrolysis to generate largazole thiol (113a) that is optimized to access the zinc within the active site of the HDAC to give its potent inhibitory effect, similar to the active (reduced) form of FDA approved drug FK228 (romidepsin).245 Largazole thiol (113a) exhibited potent, sub-nM activity against class I isoforms HDAC 1, 2, and 3 (Ki of 0.07, 0.07, 0.17 nM), and to a much lesser extent class IIb isoform HDAC6 (Ki 25 nM).239 For comparison, FK288 exhibited Ki values of 0.12, 0.14, 0.28, and 35 nM against HDAC1, 2, 3, and 6, crowning largazole thiol (113a) as the more potent HDAC inhibitor.239 The molecular docking of largazole thiol to HDAC1 crystal structure has provided a foundation in which these inhibitors interact with HDAC (Fig. | IC50 360 nM2600 nM), highlighting the importance of the prodrug for cellular efficacy.239 Largazole (113a) was shown to both induce the expression of the tumor suppressor E-cadherin and also to modulate the composition of the E-cadherin complex in triple negative breast cancer cells (TNBCs) by increasing the content of γ-catenin, promoting transport of E-cadherin to the cell surface to mediate cellcell interaction and reduce invasion.246,247 Reduced or lack of E-cadherin expression and improper cytoplasmic localization (if expressed) are characteristic feature and causative for the invasiveness of TNBCs, and largazole reversed both TNBC features to normalize the cellular phenotype to a less invasive state.246,248 This dual effect of largazole on gene expression and modulation of proteinprotein interaction translated into mouse models.246 TNBC line tumors ectopically expressing GFP-tagged E-cadherin demonstrated the proper cell surface localization upon treatment with largazole ex vivo using excised tumors or by systemic administration in vivo (10 mg kg1).246 The activity was enhanced in combination with dexamethasone which acts by preventing CDCP1 cleavage and formation of the invasive cleaved (cCDCP1) form.246 The cooperative effects with glucocorticoids indicated that largazole (113a), or HDAC inhibitors in general, could be effective in this biological context, potentially providing the basis for combination therapy clinical trials for TNBC.246 Largazole (113a) was shown to demonstrate potent and selective cytotoxicity towards a number of lung cancer cell lines, inhibiting cell proliferation within an IC50 range of 0.077 to 0.57 μM in wild type or mutant EGFR cell lines. | The 16-HBE normal human bronchial epithelial cells exhibited less potency at more than 10 μM.249 Largazole was shown to arrest the cell cycle at G1 phase with high concentrations of treatment causing activation of caspase 9 with the downregulation of pro-caspase 9, indicating a role in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway with the cleavage of PARP using Annexin VPI staining and flow cytometry analysis.249 The upregulation of p21 as demonstrated in A549 cells further supports the conclusion that largazole induces G1 phase arrest.249 More recently, largazole (113a) was found to be bioavailable in the brain and can reach in vivo concentrations sufficient to inhibit glioblastoma cell proliferation in vitro.250 At 50 mg per kg ip, largazole treatment for 12 h induced neuroprotective and cancer-related gene expression changes, extending the applicability of largazole to neurodegenerative diseases and brain cancers.250 Global gene expression profiling of largazole and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of RNA sequencing data sets revealed upregulation of neuronal transcription factor Pax6 and Oprm1.250 In addition to its role in neurogenesis and neuronal plasticity, Pax6 is known to suppress proliferation, invasion and colony formation of glioblastoma cells.251 Pax6 expression also inversely correlates with tumor grade. | Oprm1 is a μ-opioid receptor shown to induce neuroprotective activity via the mTOR signaling against β-amyloid peptide neurotoxicity and is the target for morphine.252 The therapeutic potential of largazole (113a, Fig. | These efforts led to largazole analogues without significant HDAC8 inhibition and where HDAC2 activity was dialed down (Phe), resulting in an HDAC1,3 inhibitor with 5.9-fold selectivity for HDAC1 over HDAC2. | Replacing Val with His resulted in the most HDAC1-selective isoform inhibitor with 7.0- and 5.5-fold selectivity over HDAC2 and HDAC3, respectively.257 This data suggests that the largazole scaffold can be a template for the design of next-generation isoform selective inhibitors. | Designed through a lead candidate optimization program to enhance isoform selectivity and oral bioavailability, its thiol retained class I selectivity HDACs (IC50 1.2 nM for, HDAC1; 2.4 nM for HDAC2, 2.0 nM for HDAC3, and 47 nM for HDAC8) over class IIb HDACs, including HDAC6 and 10 (IC50 47 nM, 2.8 nM); and class IV HDAC11 (IC50 2.3 nM).268,269 Recently, a first-in-human phase 1b2 trial was conducted using bocodepsin (113o) as a treatment for advanced solid tumors and concluded in prolonged disease stabilization as the first orally bioavailable, Class I targeting HDAC inhibitor.270,271 Fig. | The compound possesses structural similarities to the clinically approved HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA, vorinostat).242 Preliminary bioactivity indicated selectivity for HDAC2 at an IC50 of 0.119 nM and cytostatic activity against cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (Hut-78 GI50 1.4 μM) and colorectal cancer (HCT116 GI50 29.4 μM).242 In an independent study, the HDAC2 inhibitory activity of santacruzamate A (130) was found to block nuclear translocation of PD-L1, presumably by enhancing the acetylation status of Lys263, leading to reprogramming of the expression of immune-response related genes.242 Consequently, santacruzamate A was found to enhance the antitumor activity of PD-1 blockage using anti-PD-1 antibodies in a MC38 syngeneic mouse tumor model.278 This effect was not observed in immunocompromised nude mice, supporting the hypothesis of T-cell dependent combinatorial effect, opening up new therapeutic opportunities for HDAC2 inhibitors.9 Fig. | Proteasome inhibitors 7.1. Mechanism of action Multiple myeloma (MM) is malignant plasma cells that metastasize as osteolytic bone legions without the formation of new bone, with proteasome inhibitors as typical treatment for the incurable disease.282 Proteasomes are large protein complexes working with polymerized ubiquitin to degrade mutated or misfolded intracellular proteins in a metabolic depleting fashion. | 31 Proteasome degradation mechanism with inhibitors acting on 20S, stabilizing proteins that upregulate apoptotic signals and downregulate proteins that induce cell proliferation. | Bacterial membrane inhibitors, such as the soil bacteria metabolites lysocin E and daptomycin, target predominantly phospholipid classes like menaquinone and phosphatidylglycerol, respectively.295 The eukaryotic lipid membrane targets include ergosterol (fungi) and cholesterol (mammalian cells), with various natural product inhibitors with a wide structure diversity as described by Nishimura and Matsumori in a 2020 review.296 The frontline defense of polyene antifungal agents, like amphotericin B, complex ergosterol in the plasma membrane, disrupting membrane fluidity and integrity by permeabilizing the fungal membrane to inhibit cellular functions.297 The marine cyanobacterial polyhydroxylated macrolide amantelide A (143a) has a similar mechanism to polyene antifungals, with the additional ability to promote the polymerization of actin in cell-free systems.298,299 The marine sponge helix forming product polytheonamide B works as an ion channel and methyl-β-cyclodextrin as an acute cholesterol depleting agent, and the natural product theonellamides, the bicyclic peptide, targets both ergosterol and cholesterol. | 35) has been studied through a combination of yeast knockout mutants and chemogenomics, as well as targeted biophysical and biochemical methods.299 Amantelide A preferentially binds to sterol-containing membranes based on 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine(POPC)-based liposome studies, although the interaction is not completely dependent on sterols; however, the binding affinity increased with sterols compared with POPC liposomes alone.299 In contrast to other sterol-targeting compounds, amantelide A does not require β-configuration of the 33-OH group; binding occurred equally to cholesterol and epi-cholesterol containing POPC membranes.299 Interaction with cholesterol-containing membranes is the likely cause of rapid cell death of mammalian cells. | 35), also binds to POPC and the presence of sterols decreased binding, providing clear SAR based on only two compounds.298 The lack of activity of amantelide B (143b) suggests that acylation might serve as a self-protective mechanism of the native organism. | Since both compounds have the same effect in biochemical assays and membrane integrity is quickly compromised in cells treated amantelide A (143a) before actin interaction can occur, (1) actin binding is most likely not functionally relevant and may not occur in cells, and (2) the direct effects on sterol-membranes and actin can be separated, as is the case for amantelide B (143b). | Nevertheless, target identification has provided the basis for further evaluation of this compound class. | Chemosensitizing agents Resistance to chemotherapeutic agents in cancer treatment has been reported for most drugs used to treat lethal cancers and contributes to the failure of therapy and the cause of tumor recurrence.310 Typical drug resistance involve the tumor microenvironment (hypoxia, vascular viscosity, and reduced glucose supply), progression pathways (PI3KAkt, MAPK, and Wnt pathways), drug influx and efflux throughout the cell (acidic pH and limited solute carrier transporters), and impaired apoptosis (enhanced DNA repair via Wnt signaling).310 Chemosensitizing agents discussed here fall into two groups: (1) inherently cytotoxic but do not display the requisite selectivity or inappropriately used, including compounds that act on actin dynamics grassypeptolide A (165), lyngbyabellin A (166) and dolastatin 12 (167), and (2) compounds that are weakly or non-cytotoxic but enhance the sensitivity to cytotoxins and to inducers of apoptosis (doscadenamides (175a,b; 176a,b)).311315 9.1. Overcoming Nrf2-mediated drug resistance: actin agents and grassypeptolides Similar to microtubules, the actin cytoskeleton is critical for many processes, including cell division and migration.21 However, actin agents, including promoters of G-actin polymerization into F-actin or microfilament depolymerizers, have not been successful as stand-alone agents which can likely be due to cardiac and respiratory toxicities associated with non-specific binding to actin.311,316,317 However, nuances including different binding sites exist that might lead to distinct pharmacological consequences.318 Actin also influences signaling pathways and actin related protein suggested by the identification of ACTR10 in a genomic siRNA screen for Nrf2 inhibitors.319,320 In a small molecule screen, the cyanobacterial actin agents lyngbyabellin A (166) and dolastatin 12 (167) were also identified as inhibitors of Nrf2 signaling, a stress response pathway that is linked to drug resistance (Fig. | 37).311,313,320 Nrf2 is an important regulator of detoxification and electron exchange via antioxidant response elements (ARE) gene expression and Phase II detoxification enzyme regulation, critical for cell survival and suppression of carcinogenesis in early stage cancer diagnosis.318,321 However, overactivation of Nrf2 within cancer cells can induce the overexpression of metabolic enzymes, contributing to the metabolic reprogramming to avoid apoptosis, thus installing a cancer resistance mechanism.318,321 Grassypeptolide A (165) was identified in the same screen as an Nrf2 inhibitor and also sensitized cancer cells to chemotherapeutic tubulin agent vinblastine, revealing a potential opportunity for combination therapy at low doses.314,320 Grassypeptolide A (165) isolated from the marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya confervoides has modest (low micromolar) antiproliferative activity and induces p21 and p27 and decreases cyclin D1 expression, presumably leading to the observed G1 cell cycle arrest.314 These compound classes with unrelated mechanisms would probably benefit from detailed mechanistic studies and could be resurrected for use as agents for combination therapy (Fig. | 9.2. Synergy with TRAIL: doscadenamides Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) binds to death receptors DR4 and DR5, leading to selective cancer cell death.324 However, recombinant TRAIL protein and agents targeting the TRAIL pathway lacked sufficient efficacy in the clinic due to developing resistance to TRAIL.325 Quorum sensing (QS) activators in Gram-negative bacteria also have eukaryotic targets with cancer relevance.326 Mutant studies revealed that doscadenamide A (175a, Fig. | 40a) can act as a non-homoserine lactone template for combination with TRAIL or TRAIL pathway activators based on model studies in triple negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells at 50 μM for most analogues.327 Synthesis of the natural doscadenamides (175a) and a strategic set of analogues (175bc, 175b) (Fig. | 40b) is predominantly responsible for both QS and TRAIL-sensitizing activity.327 Specifically, doscadenamides F (175b, natural product) and S4 (175c, synthetic) with partial or complete saturation of the two acyl side chains, respectively, and doscadenamides S10S12 (synthetic), lacking one of the acyl chains (Moya1), were most effective in sensitizing to TRAIL.327 These compounds reduced the MDA-MB-231 cancer cell viability and induced PARP cleavage as an indicator of apoptosis. | However, the potency of doscadenamides is very low (25 to 50 μM) hence these agents are merely proof-of-concept compounds at this stage.327 10. | Antimetastatic agents Several cyanobacterial compounds that do not have inherent cytotoxic anticancer effects have shown to inhibit proteases and modulate GPCRs that mediate cell migration and invasion.329,330 The cellular effects, mainly assessed in invasive breast cancer cells, suggest their potential as antimetastatic agents.331 Proteases are also components of the tumor microenvironment and protease inhibitors might also indirectly affect cancer cells through inhibition of aberrant protein processing in different cell types. | As described in Section 3.2, apratoxins also modulate the tumor microenvironment; however, they also have inherent antiproliferative effects that are not observed with the compounds discussed in this section (Fig. | 41 Protease inhibitors with various targets. | 10.1. Protease inhibitors Drug development efforts for protease inhibitors based on natural products, including those of marine cyanobacterial origin, was recently reviewed.332 While the focus has been mainly on pulmonary diseases, certain serine proteases play a role in cancer progression and metastasis and are targeted by marine cyanobacterial compounds.9,332 One such protease is human neutrophil elastase (HNE) which has mainly been linked to pulmonary inflammatory conditions, but also cancer progression, cell migration and metastasis.333 HNE has broad substrate specificity and overactivity leads to degradation of extracellular matrix, cleavage of inflammatory mediators and induction of cytokines and growth factors. | Dysfunction of kallikreins (KLKs), a group of 15 family members, has also been impacted in cancer and many other disorders.334 Among them, KLK7 was recently shown to be targeted by the same class of cyclodepsipeptides as HNE inhibitors.335 The serine proteases, chymotrypsin-like human neutrophil elastase (HNE), kallikreins (KLK), and trypsin-like enzymes are broad spectrum mediators of biological processes with multiple targets, including cytokine receptors and EGFR for HNE, PAR receptors for KLK, and trypsin, plasmin, and matriptase for trypsin-like proteases.336 The aspartic proteases include cathepsin D and E which are both biomarkers of cancer (particularly cathepsin D) and induce downstream proliferation of cancer cells after entered the cell from the lysosomes.337,338 BACE1 is an aspartic protease involved with poor prognosis and overexpression in tumor progression.339 ADAM9 and 10 are metalloproteases that promote tumor progression and metastasis, with effect on therapeutic resistance and poor diagnosis via ADAM9 (Fig. | 41).340 10.2. Chymotrypsin-like serine protease inhibitors: symplostatin 5, molassamide, lyngbyastatin 7, and tutuilamide A Among the over 100 members of the 3-amino-6-hydroxy-2-piperidone (Ahp)-containing cyclodepsipeptides with 19-membered core ring structure, only a few have been rigorously characterized and evaluated for potential therapeutic applications (Fig. | 42), including symplostatin 5 (181d), molassamide (181b), lyngbyastatin 7 (Lbs7, 181a) and tutuilamide A (TtaA, 181i).341 While Ahp unit is the classical pharmacophore for the serine protease-inhibitory activity, the adjacent 2-amino-2-butenoic acid (Abu) drives the selectivity towards chymotrypsin-like enzymes (elastase), especially HNE and KLK7, leading to nanomolar to sub-nanomolar activity at the enzyme level (IC50). | Selectivity is presumably determined by hydrogen bonding of the Abu unit, as previously seen with the stabilization of the ethylidene unit of Abu via CHπ interactions and the interaction of the Abu-containing inhibitor FR901277 towards the porcine pancreatic elastase.342,343 Specifically, under identical conditions, lyngbyastatin 7 (181a) and tutuilamide A (181i) inhibited HNE with IC50 of 0.85 nM and 0.73 nM, respectively, and human KLK7 with IC50 of 3.1 nM and 5.0 nM, respectively.335 Docking studies of lyngbyastatin 7 (181a) and tutuilamide A (181i) to HNE showed that both interact with the enzymes similar to other Ahp-Abu elastase inhibitors (Fig. | 43).335 Additionally, docking models of lyngbyastatin 7 and tutuilamide A against KLK7 revealed the presence of key interactions between Asn192 and Phe218, amino acids that are not conserved between other KLK homologues.335 This could indicate the reason for the observed selectivity of KLK7 by both compounds. | 10.3. Trypsin-like serine protease inhibitors: kempopeptins The serine protease inhibitors kempopeptins are also Ahp-containing cyclodepsipeptides produced from a tentative Lyngbya species, compared with those in Section 10.2, favoring trypsin-like enzymes. | At the same concentration, a significant inhibitory effect on cell migration was detected, presumably due to inhibition of trypsin-like serine proteases. | Despite the wealth of known cyanobacterial serine protease inhibitors specifically targeting these enzymes as substrate mimics, including micropeptins,352,353 there have been limited studies to probe cellular activity and phenotypic consequences in the context of cancer.354 10.4. Aspartic protease inhibitors: grassystatins Among aspartic proteases, particularly cathepsin D has been linked to cancer, as a biomarker for aggressive breast cancer with poor prognosis but also therapeutic target.337 Cathepsin D controls several signaling cascades, including plasminogen activators and cysteine cathepsins B and L that lead to metastasis and invasion. | Specifically, plasminogen activators are inhibited by PAI-1 which is one target of cathepsin D, while another proteolytic cathepsin D target, cystatin C (Cys-C), inhibits cysteine proteases that play a role in cancer progression.355 The pepstatin-like aspartic protease inhibitors of the grassystatin class (189a, 189b, Fig. | 46) was the most potent cathepsin D inhibitor, while grassystatin F (189c) was used in proof-of-concept studies and inhibited migration, in contrast to grassystatin D (189b, Fig. | Since the invasive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells are TNBCs with high CCR10 expression, the antimetastatic potential was assessed in this cell type using cell proliferation and migration assays upon stimulation with CCL27 under serum-starved condition.366 Brintonamide D dose-dependently inhibited specifically the CCL-27 induced proliferation (10 viability reduction) and more pronouncedly inhibited migration, which was functionally linked to CCR10 antagonism because the compound phenocopied effects of an siRNA targeting CCR10 but not other GPCRs.365 Fig. | Interestingly, all brintonamides were also inhibitors of the serine protease KLK7, although in high micromolar range and without appreciable SAR and cellular activity against this target. | As demonstrated in the review, many compounds from these sources represent new chemical scaffolds that target novel pharmacological space (Fig. | In other cases, biological targets may be identical to those of compounds from other microbial, including terrestrial sources; however, the potency is oftentimes superior or binding sites differ. | Cyanobacterial protecting group chemistry that keeps compounds in a latent condition may also be unique or characteristic. | Natural products research oftentimes leads to the elucidation of a structurally intriguing compound. | They may also not have to be as extensive since compounds are already fairly optimized by nature for physiologically relevant targets. | Oftentimes the starting point provided by nature is good enough, assuming intellectual property protection concerns can be addressed to ensure development.367 Fundamentally, both the supply problem and novel pharmacological action need to be addressed in order to differentiate the compounds from other agents in development or in the clinic. | For almost all compounds discussed in this review, the key biology (target) and chemistry (supply) issues have been solved. | Some compounds may not have drug-like properties; however, they could provide the basis for the design of compounds with similar pharmacology that are more amenable for development. | Lastly, we have only seen the tip of the iceberg of specialized metabolites from marine cyanobacteria, as genome or metagenome sequencing suggest that the biosynthetic potential is oftentimes 10-fold higher than what is observed at the chemical level.369 Translating biosynthetic potential into screenable and therefore actionable compounds through synthetic biology is another exciting avenue in the field and for drug discovery.353,370,371 Furthermore, enabling technologies such as antibody conjugation and other emerging technologies will guarantee that we maximize the potential of these evolutionarily optimized compounds.372374 13.","##iba (MISC), A (MISC), ##c (MISC), A (MISC), SE (MISC)"

jInstitute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, Zürich, Switzerland Aims: Multiple biological effects have been described for diverse PrP-directed antibodies, ranging from neuroprotection (even qualifying for therapeutic administration) to induction of toxicity. | Conclusions: Reducing cellular PrP levels is considered neuroprotective with regard to neurodegenerative proteinopathies and, hence, represents the goal of several recent therapeutic strategies. | Analysis of the protein in NAA revealed counterintuitively that syntaxin-6 is a potent inhibitor of PrP fibril formation. | Results: We utilized the LIPS technology to screen a CRISPR library of approximately 1,000 RNA-binding proteins, a compound library of more than 2,000 FDA- and EMA-approved drugs, and an in-house collection of 160 natural extracts. | We identified several genes, small molecules, and natural metabolites capable of suppressing PrP expression or promoting its delocalization to lysosomal degradation directly from the endoplasmic reticulum. | Curcuma phaeocaulis Valeton (Zingiberaceae) extract and compounds are efficacious to modulate prion propagation Jaehyeon Kim, Hakmin Lee, Hye Mi Kim, Eun Mei Gao, Jieun Kim, Trang H. | Aims: Evaluation of anti-prion efficacy of Curcuma phaeocaulis Valeton (Zingiberaceae) and identification of active compounds. | Next, We endeavoured to identify the chemical constituents of CpV extracts and discover potential anti-prion active compounds. | Subsequent efficacy testing in a cell culture model of prion disease identified curcumenol and furanodienone as active compounds. | Two anti-prion active compounds (curcumenol and furanodienone) were identified in the CpV extract. | Results: Initially, I conducted a proof-of-concept screen focused on membrane proteins that might serve as receptors or inhibitors of prion entry. | Interestingly, in my screen the R-SMAD proteins identified (SMAD1, SMAD5) enhanced prion uptake upon activation, while the inhibitory SMAD6 had the opposite effect. | Aims: α-Synuclein (α-Syn) fibrillar aggregates are crucial pharmaceutical targets for diagnosis and therapeutics of synucleinopathies, emphasizing the need for compounds that can track them or inhibit their intercellular transmission. | However, current assays, such as fluorescence saturation assays, only search for and validate compound binding to fibrils without any binding pattern information. | Materials and Methods: Here, we developed two structure-based high-throughput competition screening assays: the BF227 competition assay (BA) for tracers and the Heparin competition assay (HA) for inhibitors, based on insights into how chemical binders interact with α-Syn fibril pockets. | Conclusions: In conclusion, our structure-based assays enable rational screening to identify lead compounds, paving the way for their further optimization and potential clinical application as tracers and inhibitors. | Consistent with this conclusion, compounds that prevent accumulation of PrPSc also block synaptotoxicity, but only if applied within the first few hours after exposure to PrPSc. We have also carried out transcriptomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of PrPSc-treated hippocampal neurons, and processed the results using a chemo-proteomics pipeline. | Notably, two genes involved in regulating actin polymerization WASP-like actin nucleation-promoting factor (Wasl) and brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1-associated protein 2 (Baiap2) significantly blocked prion infection, with effect levels of 51 and 32, respectively. | Consistent with this, studies show that partial microglia deficiencyablation accelerates prion disease and increases prion accumulation in the brain, suggesting that microglia provide neuroprotection by engulfing prions. | Our data suggest that microglia instead provide neuroprotection by moderating the deleterious effects of neurotoxicneuroneglective reactive astrocytes, but lose this ability as they adopt a disease-associated microglia phenotype as the disease progresses. | In fact, we demonstrated an inhibitory role of plasmin for PrPSc formation through PrP α-cleavage that increased C1 fragments resulting in reduced prion conversion in PMCA and cell cultures. | Furthermore, the reduction of prion infectivity titre in the bioassay of plasmin-treated PMCA material also supported the inhibitory role of plasmin on PrPSc replication. | Therefore, searching for new compounds with antiprion activity, capable of preventing prion conversion and aggregation, is of significant therapeutic interest. | Affinity selection-mass spectrometry (AS-MS) and microfractionation were used to isolate and identify compounds with more than 50 inhibition of aggregation. | Results: Our results showed that the extracts exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on aggregate formation in a dose-dependent manner.","Parvez Alama (PER), Forrest Hoytb (PER), Efrosini Artikisa (PER), Jakub Soukupa (PER), Cindi L.

11613623.xml,Ferroptosis in schizophrenia: Mechanisms and therapeutic potentials (Review),"Under conditions of stress or specific cellular signals, ferritin can undergo degradation via a process called ferritinophagy, typically facilitated by nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) (49). | These compounds can form adducts with DNA, proteins and other vital macromolecules, further impairing cellular functions (6567). | NCOA4-mediated promotion mechanism NCOA4 is important in various cellular processes, surpassing its originally identified role as a coactivator for nuclear receptors, such as androgen and thyroid hormone receptors (74,75). | The functions of NCOA4 are attributed to its structural design, comprising an N-terminal domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions, a central coactivator domain essential for its coactivation role and a C-terminal domain crucial for the autophagic breakdown of ferritin (7679). | Pharmacological interventions through the use of NOX inhibitors, including diphenyleneiodonium and GKT137831, have demonstrated that inhibiting NOX4 can substantially reduce ROS levels and lipid peroxidation, and thus protect against ferroptosis (109,110). | These findings are further corroborated by experimental models that show increased NOX4 activity under oxidative stress conditions, including treatment with RAS-selective lethal small molecule 3 (RSL3) or erastin, which have been shown to enhance lipid peroxidation and subsequent cell death (111,112). | Specifically, ATF3 reduces the expression of GPX4, which is crucial for converting lipid hydroperoxides into non-toxic compounds, thus promoting lipid peroxidation (115). | Central to this process are two primary factors: i) The depletion of GSH, which is critical for the antioxidant function of GPX4 (111); and ii) direct effects on GPX4, including oxidative damage to its structure, genetic alterations affecting its expression and functionality and the use of specific pharmacological inhibitors (148150). | Depletion of GSH due to intensified oxidative stress or the action of inhibitors significantly reduces the ability of GPX4 to counteract lipid peroxidation, leading to increased lipid peroxides and subsequent ferroptosis (151). | Furthermore, the ERVW-1-induced effects could be reversed by the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (201). | For instance, NAC has been shown to exhibit neuroprotective effects by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, linked to schizophrenia. | For instance, a 12-week trial showed that omega-3 fatty acids supplementation significantly improved cognitive function and increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, while reducing inflammatory markers such as IL-6, TNF-α and C-reactive protein (CRP) (244).","Schizophrenia (MISC), ##chi (MISC), ##chi (MISC), ##chi (MISC), Schizophrenia (MISC)"
11613704.xml,Adverse Ocular Impact and Emerging Therapeutic Potential of Cannabis and Cannabinoids: A Narrative Review,"Studies have reported the therapeutic efficacy of cannabinoids in treating chronic pain, alleviating spasticity in multiple sclerosis, and serving as an antiemetic.2 Research into cannabinoids applications to treat ocular conditions have revealed its potential in treating blepharospasm38 and lowering intraocular pressure in glaucoma.930 Animal studies demonstrate anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, corneal regenerative effects,3140 and retinal neuroprotective effects of cannabinoids.4154 Several unwanted effects of medical and recreational cannabis use are described in the scientific literature, including nausea, somnolence, and hallucinations.2 Other reports have suggested more substantial effects, including its contribution to the incidence of psychotic disorders.55 As for its effects on the eye, adverse ocular effects of cannabinoids and cannabis reported in contemporary literature include eyelid tremor,5660 ptosis,6168 corneal opacification,69,70 reduced corneal endothelial cell count,71 reduced corneal revascularization,72 neuroretinal dysfunction,7384 retinal vasculature abnormalities,4752 and impaired extraocular motility.85101 As ongoing research explores the therapeutic benefits of cannabinoids, the understanding of its adverse effects continues to evolve. | In the last decade, there has been a 23 increase in global users:1 a growth rate more rapid than both opiates and cocaine.104 As of 2023, cannabis, commonly referred to as marijuana, pot, weed, grass, or herb, is legal in several countries,102 and 23 states in the United States.103 The use of cannabis for medical purposes has occurred for millennia, with the first historical documentation of its medical use appearing nearly 5000 years ago in Ancient Chinese texts.105 There has been a resurgence of interest in the uses of cannabinoids, the chemical compound in cannabis, to treat several medical conditions in the last few decades.2,106,107 Method of Literature Search A systematic literature search of Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and Scopus from inception of the databases to June 25, 2023, was conducted to identify relevant papers. | Pharmacological Effects of Cannabinoids The cannabis plant species contains approximately 540 natural compounds, over 100 of which are classified as phytocannabinoids (plant-derived cannabinoids) based on their chemical structure.109 The most extensively studied phytocannabinoids are Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), which are the predominant psychotropic and non-psychoactive ingredients, respectively.109 The C. | CB1 and CB2 are coupled through G proteins, particularly G io (inhibitory G protein), to inhibit adenylate cyclase and influence mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in some contexts.111 CB1 receptors are also coupled through G proteins to various calcium and potassium channels, promoting neuron hyperpolarization.111 Cannabinoid Receptors The localization of CB1 and CB2 receptors has been delineated using several strategies, each providing unique insights.112 These include messenger RNA in situ hybridization, immunocytochemistry, and quantitative autoradiography.113 CB1 receptors are mainly localized to the brain and central nervous system, while CB2 receptors are predominately localized to the peripheral nervous system and immune system.111,114,115 Most CB1 receptors are located on the pre-terminal axonal segments of neuronal axons, with fewer on other parts of the neuron.116 CB1 receptors can also be found on CCK-positive basket cells,116 on many glutamatergic terminals in the brain,117 and within some peripheral tissues, including the liver,118 pancreas,119 skeletal muscle,120 and adipocytes.121 CB2 receptors are expressed on immune cells,115 neuronal cells,122 as well as cells involved in bone mass regulation.123 The human body produces endogenous cannabinoids called endocannabinoids.112 The endocannabinoid system consists of cannabinoid receptors and the enzymes responsible for the synthesis and degradation of endocannabinoids.112 Endogenous cannabinoids include arachidonoyl ethanolamide (anandamide) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG).111 These endogenous cannabinoids activate CB1 and CB2 receptors, amongst other GPCRs and ion channels.124 The simple conceptual framework of agonists and antagonists is not enough to understand the complex pathways within the endocannabinoid system,112 with a complete understanding requiring an understanding of partial agonism,125 functional selectivity,126 and inverse agonism.127 Safety Considerations The psychoactive cannabinoid, THC, produces many of the adverse effects of cannabis, while the non-psychoactive CBD is credited for its therapeutic effects.107,128 Non-medical cannabinoid products have differences in their relative concentrations of CBD and THC.110 Retailers who sell cannabinoids are not subject to the same strict regulations as medical prescriptions.129 CBD preparations of these products are often inaccurate,130,131 with CBD and THC concentrations often mislabeled.132,133 Individuals who use cannabis for self-medication report treating pain, anxiety, depression, headachemigraine, nausea, and muscle spasticity.134 The CBD concentrations from retail products are often lower levels than those used in clinical trials and may even contain THC levels that exceed legal limits.130 Meanwhile, medical-grade cannabinoids, both synthetic or plant-derived, have more accurate concentrations of THC and CBD.129 Plant-derived or synthetic CBD have no pharmacological differences when tested in vitro.135 Information on cannabinoid drug interactions is scarce,136 which raises safety concerns. | CB1 receptors are located in the central nervous system, including the eyes, and have been shown to provide neuroprotection to retinal cells, particularly in reducing excitotoxicity, inflammation, and oxidative stress.142 CB1 receptors are also located on the corneal epithelium and endothelium.144 While activation of CB1 receptors has been associated with neuroprotective effects, chronic or excessive CB1 activation, often with the use of exogenous cannabinoids like THC, can potentially cause neurotoxicity. | While some studies suggest CB2 expression in the eyes,145 this topic remains controversial.142 They have been shown to mediate immune and inflammatory responses and contribute to aqueous humor turnover, which can ultimately also promote neuroprotection by suppressing inflammation and immune-mediated damage.22,40,146 Barriers to Ocular Drug Delivery to the Eye On the ocular level, topical administration of drugs is preferred as it can reduce adverse effects from systemic routes of administration.147 However, only 35 of the administered dose reaches the eye due to structural and dynamic barriers.148 When drugs are administered orally, only 12 reach the eye,149 and they present with greater systemic adverse effects. | He smoked 15 grams of cannabis daily for

proteins, IAPs, or Bcl-2 family members) can effectively control caspases and restrict the level of their activation. | As a result, therapeutic targeting of caspases, either inhibitors or activators, is of great interest as a therapeutic intervention. | However, only a limited number of caspase inhibitors have advanced to clinical trials due to the wide range of non-apoptotic functions of these proteins in normal conditions, as well as the persistent challenges with their usage in treating diverse diseases. | To confirm these results, researchers examined the activation of YAP-dependent

AML.494 Up to date, at least five SWISNF subunits bear bromodomains, including Family IV and VIII. | PFI-3 is the first identified inhibitor selectively binding to the bromodomains of SMARCA24 and PBRM1. | Although applying PFI-3 alone has limited effect on some cancer cells, it significantly sensitized of these cancer cells to chemotherapy.495,496 PB16 and GNE-235 are two promising PBRM1 selective inhibitors, but their biological function remains to be elucidated.497,498 BRD7 and BRD9, assembled into different SWISNF complexes, contain Family IV bromodomains.499 BRD9 or BRD7 is considered as oncogene or tumor suppressive, respectively,500,501 thus more studies are focused on targeting BRD9. | LP99 is the first identified drug binding to the bromodomains of BRD7 and BRD9 to evict both proteins from acetylated histones.502 The BRD9 selective bromodomains inhibitors, such as BI-7271, BI-7273, BI-9564,503 and I-BRD9,504 significantly inhibit the progression of many cancers. | Recently, compounds 1-78 and 2-77 were identified as the first BRD7-selective inhibitors which can suppress the proliferation of prostate cancer cells.505 PROTAC is an effective method for specific protein degradation in vivo. | constructed an ATPase degrader by linking a SMARCA4 ATPase inhibitor to a phthalimide, called JQ-dS-4, facilitating ubiquitin E3 ligase CRBN-mediated degradation, which suppressed the progression of glioma.506 ACBI1 and AU-15330 are two PROTACs that link the Family VIII bromodomains with E3 ligase VHL to promote the degradation of SMARCA24, and PBRM1.507,508 A947 and PRT3789 selectively degrade SMARCA2 to suppress SMARCA4 mutant solid tumors.509,510 GSK39,511 dBRD9,512 C6,513 CFT8634,514 and FHD-609515 are CRBN-based PROTACs for BRD9, all of which showed

a methylated DNA-binding protein within the NuRD complex. | screened out four inhibitors, mitoxantrone, idarubicin, NF449, and aurintricarboxylic acid, to inhibit the binding of MBD2 with methylated DNA.518 HDAC1 and HDAC2 are the important subunits of different NuRD complexes. | Trichostatin A (TSA) and SAHA (also called as Vorinostat), two broad spectrum HDAC inhibitors, are applied in many clinical trials. | Both TSA and SAHA have been reported to remodel the chromatin accessibility.519,520 Up to date, many HDAC12 selective inhibitors have been found, such as Cmpd60,521 mocetinostat (MGCD0103),522 romidepsin (FK228),523 tacedinaline (CI-994), santacruzamate A (CAY10683),524 and so on, which have the potential to treat cancer and hypertension, as well as alleviate aging. | identified a SMARCA5CHD4 dual inhibitor, ED2-AD101, suppressed the proliferation of AML cells and promoted the epithelial differentiation of many solid tumor cells.525 BPTF is the largest subunit of ISW1 complex, containing bromodomains. | BI-2536 and bromosporine are the first two discovered inhibitors of BPTF, but their specificity are limited.526,527 Zhang et al. | screened out a selective BPTF bromodomain inhibitor, called DCB29, but the biological function is unknown.528 Xu et al. | identified another BPTF bromodomain inhibitor, named C620-0696, which suppressed the progression of NSCLC mainly by inhibiting c-Myc transcription.529 Targeting INO80 complex RUVBL1 and RUVBL2, containing ATPase activity, are parts of INO80 and SWR1 complexes. | identified an allosteric inhibitor of the ATPase domain of RUVBL12, named CB-6644, which can suppress the progression of many cancers.530 Besides, Nano et al. | indicated that sorafenib inhibited the ATPase activity of RUVBL12 complex by directly interacting with RUVBL2.531 Currently, there are many chromatin remodeller inhibitors, but satisfactory results are rarely achieved in clinical application. | Whats more, the functions of most inhibitors on chromatin accessibility, in particular at specific sites, are still require further investigation. | indicated that DNMT inhibitors decitabine or guadecitabine (SGI-110) enhanced the antitumor immunity by increasing the accessibility and expression of HLA-I in prostate cancer cells, while combination with the HDAC inhibitor LBH-589 (LBH) getting a better effect.536 Additionally, combined treating by DNMT inhibitor decitabine and HDAC inhibitor SAHA increased the chromatin accessibility and sensitized solid tumor cells to cisplatin, doxorubicin, and irradiation.537 Combined applying decitabine and EZH2 inhibitor GSK126, suppressed the proliferation and upregulated anti-tumor immune response in human HCC cells.77 Besides, many natural bioactive compounds have been reported to inhibit DNMTs in many cancers.538 The removement of 5mC modification dependents on the ten-eleven translocation protein family (TETs) and thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG).539 Researches have indicated that the accumulation of oncometabolite, fumarate, succinate, and 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) induced by hydratase (FH), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and isocitrate dehydrogenase 12 (IDH12) mutations, respectively, significantly inhibited both α-ketoglutarate (α-KG)-dependent histone and DNA demethylases,540,541 which linking metabolism and epigenetics.542 Verdura et al. | indicated that decarboxymethyl oleuropein aglycone (DOA), a naturally phenolic compound in olive oil, can inhibit the mutant IDH1, IDH1-R132H, to reverse hypermethylation of DNA and H3K9 through restoring the 2-HG-suppressed demethylases.543 Multiple researches have indicated that targeting IDH-mutant to restore DNA and histone demethylation is a promising anti-cancer strategy.544 Xu et al. | But, the TET1 inhibitor, bobcat339 hydrochloride, reversed the inhibitory effect of MAGI2-AS3.545 Therapeutic opportunity by targeting histone modifier The epigenetic modifications on histones and their functions are complex, which orchestrated by multiple modifiers. | indicated that the P300 inhibitor GNE-781 sensitized multiple myeloma (MM) to immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiD) through blocking the super-enhancers accessibility and suppressing the expression of Myc, IRF4 and POU2AF1.546 Lindqvist et al. | indicated that the CBPP300 bromodomain inhibitors, CBP30 and I-CBP112, facilitated cellular reprogramming by decreasing the H3K27ac modification, chromatin accessibility, and expression of somatic-specific genes.548 A-485 inhibits the acetyltransferase activity of P300 to targeting enhancer accessibility in leukemia stem cells.549 Besides, Hu et al. | revealed that the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitor, anacardic acid, alleviated paraquat-induced pulmonary fibrosis by reducing the expression of IL-6 in macrophages.550 MG149 inhibits MOF to attenuate MKL1-induced cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice.551 MG149 also decreases the total lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation (Khib) modification by inhibiting TIP60 in pancreatic cancer.552 Currently, there are more researches on histone deacetylase inhibitors. | Through high-throughput small molecule screening, Pattenden et al. | identified a series of HDAC inhibitors, such as SAHA, TSA, panobinostat (LBH-589), givinostat (ITF2357), abexinostat (PCI-24781), tubastatin A (HDAC6 selective), PCI-34051 (HDAC8 selective), and so on, which can remodel the chromatin accessibility.553 Yang et al. | indicated that the HDAC8 inhibitor, PCI-34051, increased the infiltration of CD8 T cells and enhanced the therapeutic effect of PD-L1 blockade in HCC mice model.132 Similarly, the HDAC6 inhibitor, tubastatin A, also inhibits the expression of PD-L1 in melanoma cells. | Treating with DOT1L inhibitor, EPZ-5676, reduced H3K79me23 modification globally in leukemia cells.106 EPZ-5676 also reduced the H3K79me2 modification and accessibility of Sox2-binding enhancers to impair neuronal differentiation.107 Combined utilization of donafenib and the JMJD3 inhibitor, GSK-J4, suppressed the proliferation of liver cancer by enhancing ferroptosis both in vitro and in vivo.111 Ku et al. | revealed that furamidine (FM) inhibited PRMT1, reducing the H4R3me2 modification, chromatin accessibility, and expression of glycolysis-related genes to reverse the chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer.387 Treated the CRC organoids by the histone demethylase inhibitor, methylstat, significantly restore the H4K20me3 and H3K27me3 levels in a dose-dependent manner, meanwhile reduced organoids growth.104 Therapeutic opportunity by targeting TF or co-TF The transcription and cotranscription factors (TFs and co-TFs) can occupy the cis-acting element specifically to determine the local accessibility of chromatin. | AR inhibitors are applied for the treatment of prostate cancer, but drug resistance is a major clinical problem. | revealed that the AR inhibitor, enzalutamide (ENZ), increased the chromatin accessibility and expression of SIX2, facilitating stem-like reprogramming, neuroendocrine differentiation, and AR inhibitors resistance.554 ONECUT2 was a prostate cancer trigger through remodel the chromatin accessibility landscape independent of AR. | The activation of ONECUT2 was an novel mechanisms of drug resistance, and inhibiting ONECUT2 by CSRM-617 reshaped chromatin accessibility, expression profile, and cell lineage of prostate cancer cells.555 MYCi975 is a Myc inhibitor that disrupts MycMax dimerization.556 Holmes et al. | demonstrated that MYCi975 reduced H3K27ac and chromatin accessibility at the binding motifs of CTCF and FOX family transcription factors.557 AZD4573, an CDK9 inhibitor, remodeled the global promoter and enhancer accessibility as well as inhibited the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of lymphoma cells.558 Seredinski et al. | indicated that the acriflavine, inhibited DNA topoisomerase, increasing the locus accessibility and expression of many lncRNAs to suppress the growth of endothelial cells.559 Additionally, other selective inhibitor also attenuated the recruitment of TFs to their binding motifs, such as HLM006474 (E2F inhibitor), S3I-201 (STAT3 inhibitor),560 Am80 (KLF5 inhibitor),561 gliotoxin (NOTCH2 inhibitor),562 and so on. | Besides, targeting the specific kinases of the TFs also is a viable strategy for chromatin remodeling, such as XAV-939 (TNKS12 inhibitor) and VT02956 (LATS inhibitor) to determine WNTβ-catenin- and HippoYAP-mediated chromatin dynamics, respectively.563,564 As mentioned above, there are many targeting compounds to remodel chromatin structure, however, most of them have not yet entered clinical or preclinical trials. | Even if some inhibitors have got clinical trials, the therapeutic effect are still not satisfactory. | The main reasons include the low specificity and bioavailability of these inhibitors. | Hence, in parallel with searching for more selective inhibitors, screening out inhibitors to specifically target the assembly of specific complexes may be a more promising strategy to reverse the dysregulation chromatin accessibility.",""

That is to say, cAMP changes the intrinsic state of neurons. | The liver cell membrane aggravated the phagocytosis burden of macrophages, resulting in a consequent reduced phagocytosis of myelin debris, so that myelin debris accumulated at the lesion site, whose inhibitory effect had been demonstrated (7779). | After comparing myelin debris in CNS with counterpart in PNS or other cell membranes, scholars found that this inhibitory effect on OPC was limited to myelin debris in CNS (80). | Although the inhibitory effect of myelin debris on oligodendrocytes has been found, the internal mechanism is still unknown. | The direct inhibitory effects of MAIs on axons and oligodendrocytes have been discussed thereinbefore, which impede nerve regeneration through obstruct axon regeneration and axon remyelination. | Through summary and analysis, the present authors found that there are some commonalities in the inhibitory effects: Whether or not MAIs have dual functions, they all show inhibitory effects on axonal growth cones after SCI in adult; meanwhile it is believed that it may be related to the content of cAMP in neurons, which may account for the reason that the prognosis of patients with SCI deteriorates gradually with physical maturity. | Figure 2 The indirect inhibitory effect of myelin debris. | The team also found that after treatment of macrophages with myelin debris, the activity of STAT3 and STAT6 signaling pathways was suppressed, while the phosphorylation level of intracellular NF-κB inhibitory protein (IκB-α) was up-regulated, thus allowing the release of NF-κB into the nucleus for transcriptional activation (96, 102). | Therefore, by using PI3KAKTmTOR inhibitors, the team found that the autophagy of macrophages was restored and foam cells in SCI was reduced correspondingly. | A1 astrocytes are neurotoxic and can hinder the SCI repair, while A2 astrocytes are neuroprotective and can promote the repair (131). | 4 Discussion Thereinbefore, the present authors have discussed in detail the influence of myelin debris on the pathophysiological process of SCI from the perspective of its direct and indirect inhibitory effect. | Although much of the inhibitory effect of myelin debris is observed, some ideas remain controversial. | First, although MAIs plays an inhibitory role, they actually promote axon growth. | As Filbin believed (11), the MAIs in previous studies did not have inhibitory effects on axon growth cones. | It was the change of neurons (mainly the decrease of intracellular cAMP with maturity) that made axon growth cones sensitive to these inhibitory substances. | However, the present authors hold that the three views on the inhibitory effect of myelin debris should be comprehensively considered, and that the inhibition of MAIs on axon growth cone exists, but it is to assist the growth of axons. | After the body maturates, neurons strengthen this directional guidance caused by recognizing myelin debris as inhibitory substances. | Regarding drugs for the treatment of SCI, rapamycin, the mTOR inhibitor, promotes the clearance of myelin debris through immunosuppression and induction of autophagy, reducing phagocytes activation and increasing the number of surviving neurons at the injury site (150156).","MA (MISC), MA (MISC), SCI (MISC)"

11621763.xml,New insights into protein–protein interaction modulators in drug discovery and therapeutic advance,"Moreover, this understanding aids in the inference of their dynamic regulation as well as being central to functional genomics and drug discovery.29 Many studies have demonstrated that PPIs are primarily influenced by the hydrophobic effect.3033 When this is combined with the fact that PPIs do not share the same structural patterns as enzymes, where the largest or deepest clefts are an indicator of the substrate binding sites, one may conclude that interactions involving enzyme active sites are not typically considered to be PPIs in the context of drug discovery.3436 Instead, binding sites in PPIs usually encompass specific residue combinations, distinct regions, and unique architectural layouts, resulting in cooperative formations referred to as hot spots.3739 Hot spots are defined as residues whose substitution, typically by alanine or other amino acids such as glycine and valine with similar disruptive effects, results in a substantial decrease in the binding free energy (ΔΔG 2 kcalmol) of a PPI.4044 The energetic contributions of hot spots stems from their localized networked arrangement within tightly packed hot regions, enabling flexibility and the capacity to bind to multiple different partners in the intervening spaces.45 Such a mechanism explains how a single molecular surface is capable of interacting with multiple structurally distinctive partners whilst also allowing for the targeting of PPIs. Advances and challenges in PPI modulator discovery This section explores the computational landscape for identifying and optimizing PPI modulators and delves into the tools and strategies employed for targeting PPIs. Additionally, the key challenges in small molecule PPI modulation are highlighted along with tactics to harness protein dynamics while achieving optimal selectivity and efficacy in inhibition. | Strategies in PPI modulator discovery Rational drug design has demonstrated success in identifying modulators of PPIs by utilizing structural information derived from hot spot analysis.46 Additionally, computer modeling techniques coupled with phage display technology has enabled the rational design of peptidomimetics that are designed to recapitulate the secondary structure of key peptide helices, sheets and loops within PPIs. Among the secondary structures employed to design peptidomimetics, the α-helix has been the most widely employed owing to its frequent occurrence and successful targeting.4749 However, the challenging nature of PPI interfaces, which are often flat and featureless, renders traditional rational medicinal chemistry approaches less effective in identifying modulators.50 Due to these challenges, multiple approaches have been used to identify modulators of PPIs. High-throughput screening (HTS) is an approach that depends on the utilization of chemically diverse libraries that are often enriched with compounds more likely to target PPIs to successfully identify lead modulators.51,52 However, the effectiveness of HTS can be hindered by the lack of specific hot spots on some interfaces which has motivated the application of alternative approaches that are more suitable for the discovery of PPI modulators.53,54 Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) is one such approach which has been shown to be a useful technique for the design of PPI modulators. | For example, PPI stabilizers present a more challenging prospect than PPI inhibitors because, unlike inhibitors that disrupt the interaction interface, stabilizers enhance existing complexes by binding to specific sites on one or both proteins. | Traditional HTS methods designed for inhibitor discovery might not be well-suited for identifying stabilizers. | In conclusion, developing PPI stabilizers presents a more intricate challenge compared to inhibitors. | Virtual screening can be divided into structure-based and ligand-based approaches.62,63 The structure-based approach relies directly on utilizing the structural information of the target protein, while the ligand-based approach screens compounds fitting a pre-built pharmacophore model. | Both of these approaches have their merits and limitations; for example, structure-based virtual screening is limited to proteins which have well-known binding pockets, which are often challenging to find in a PPI.64 Conversely, ligand-based virtual screening relies upon the exploitation of known potent inhibitors to build a pharmacophore model that can be used for virtual analysis.65 However, there are several hurdles which have complicated the deployment of traditional computational approaches toward the identification of novel PPIs and understanding their mechanism of action. | The first category is small molecule modulators which are better suited for tight and narrow PPI interfaces. | However, these modulators face challenges due to the nature of PPI interfaces which tend to be large, flat, and devoid of the defined pockets that typically characterize small molecule binding sites.108,109 This can often necessitate a modulator that covers a substantial surface area and establishes numerous hydrophobic contacts, a profile that frequently introduces pharmacokinetic hurdles due to the large size and poor solubility of such moleules.50 Small molecule PPI modulators are classified based on their mechanism of action and site of interaction. | For example, small molecules that bind directly to the PPI interface and induce an inhibitory effect are referred to as orthosteric inhibitors110 while molecules that bind to a site that is remote from the PPI interface are described as allosteric in function. | However, not all modulators of PPIs are inhibitors, with some small molecule modulators stabilizing or even enhancing PPIs. Small molecule modulators acting as PPI stabilizers are commonly referred to as molecular glues and they result in the stabilization of an endogenous PPI or the induction of a non-native interaction. | When compared to traditional small molecule PPI inhibitors, molecular glues can offer the advantage of not relying upon high potency or affinity when compared to inhibitors since they do not depend the displacement of a natural binder, but rather they enhance canonical or adventitious interactions. | The second type of molecular glue is where the compound inhibits the function of the target protein by redirecting an endogenously formed PPI. | Lastly, some molecular glues induce a non-native PPI to generate a novel pharmacological activity.115 The design choice of small molecule PPI modulators is largely dependent on the availability of hot spot structural information. | Figure 2 illustrates the binding modes of small molecule PPI modulators.Fig. | a Orthosteric inhibitors bind directly to the protein-protein interface, competing with one or both proteins for binding. | b Allosteric inhibitors bind to a distinct site on one of the proteins, inducing conformational changes that disrupt the protein-protein interaction. | Created by Biorender The second modality with potential for PPI modulation involves the use of inhibitory peptides derived from the binding epitopes of interacting proteins. | Additionally, their larger size compared to small molecule drugs hinders cellular entry and their synthesis can be complex and expensive due to the numerous steps involved.119122 Another limitation of peptide-based therapeutics is the fact that the inhibitory effects of the peptides modulating PPIs depend fundamentally on their structural characteristics both in solution and when bound to the target protein. | Class D peptidomimetics functionally resemble the bioactive peptides but lack the direct link to its side chains.152154 Compared to small molecules, peptides offer heightened target specificity and affinity but can be susceptible to enzyme-mediated degradation if not carefully constructed.155 Antibody PPI modulators offer another promising avenue for the development of targeted PPIs therapeutics. | PROTACs consist of an E3 ubiquitin ligase ligand, a protein of interest (POI) ligand, and a linker.169,170 The E3 ligand recruits the cellular degradation machinery, while the POI ligand targets the protein for ubiquitination.171 In PROTACs the linker design facilitates the formation of a stable ternary complex which brings the POI in proximity to the E3 ligase leading to the promotion of its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.172 Unlike traditional small-molecule inhibitors which depend on persistent target occupancy, PROTACs induce ubiquitination through transient binding which leads to target protein degradation and subsequent recycling of the PROTAC.173175 This mechanism offers several advantages over small molecule therapeutics such as the need for lower drug dosage, reduction of potential off-target effects and the ability to overcome resistance mutations that typically render small molecule inhibitors ineffective. | Despite these advantages, PROTACs face several limitations such as the limited availability of clinical data on their safety and potential risks which raises concerns about unforeseen side effects and long-term impacts.176 Additionally, the dual-targeting nature of PROTACs often results in large molecular weight which hinders the oral bioavailability and tissue penetration.177 Furthermore, the complex chemical synthesis and potential for off-target protein degradation are additional barriers toward clinical application of PROTACs.178,179 The differences between the different types of PPI modulators are summarized in Table 1.Table 1The main differences between small molecules, PROTACs, peptidomimetics and monoclonal antibody PPI modulatorsFeatureSmall

only Challenges in small molecule PPI modulation Extensive scientific study has demonstrated the potential of manipulating PPIs using small molecule modulators as a promising avenue to treating a range of human diseases. | These small molecule modulators, which are either natural or synthetic compounds characterized by a relatively low molecular weight, interact with proteins in a way that modifies their function.50,180 Moreover, these modulators demonstrate the capacity to selectively bind to specific protein targets with high affinity via various mechanisms that includes direct inhibition, allosteric modulation, or stabilization of a PPI. | However, several challenges face the development of small molecule PPI modulators. | Among these challenges is the difficulty of identifying lead compounds that effectively target PPIs, especially in cases where naturally-occurring protein-binding small molecules are absent.181 Another significant challenge stems from the clustering of hot spot amino acid residues situated at the core of proteinprotein interfaces, surrounded by less energetically impactful residues that likely shield the surrounding solvent.182184 Additionally, proteinprotein interfaces often present flat surfaces (10002000 Å2 per side) which lack the kind of defined binding sites (300500 Å2) that can complement small molecules.46,185187 These structural features of PPI binding interfaces have resulted in small molecule PPI modulators exhibiting a larger and more hydrophobic nature when compared to typical orally bioavailable drugs.109 Despite these challenges, there has been increasing success in the targeting of PPIs with small molecule modulators, paving the way for extensive drug discovery endeavors. | These states are often crucial for facilitating interactions with various partners or small molecules, enabling the protein to perform different functions or respond to regulatory signals. | The ability to accommodate TPS ensures that the binding site can effectively engage with diverse molecules under varying physiological conditions.193195 One approach toward the targeting of transient states involves mimicking the natural protein interaction partner with a small molecule, peptidomimetic, or stapled peptide (Fig. | Linking, growing, or merging these fragments can lead to the development of inhibitors with high structural complementarity capable of mimicking classic protein mimetics but with increased efficacy.193,196,197Fig. | d Traditional drug discovery aims to mimic natural protein interactions using small molecules, peptidomimetics, or stapled peptides to displace the protein and inhibit the interaction. | Fragments identified from transient state binders (F3-F1-F2) can be linked, extended, or merged (i) to create potent inhibitors with high structural complementarity, mimicking classic protein mimetics. | Created by Biorender Traditional drug discovery assumes that small molecules induce a specific conformation in a protein for binding (the induced fit model).198,199 However, proteins may pre-exist in a number of conformations, with some being more favorable for binding a specific ligand, and small molecules may preferentially bind to these pre-existing conformations. | covalent inhibition The inhibition of biological targets typically involves the attenuation of a proteins biological function through direct binding which is the result of achieving an equilibrium between the drug and the amino acids of the target protein via multiple non-covalent interactions.205207 These non-covalent interactions include hydrogen bonds, dipole-dipole interactions, van der Waals forces, London dispersion forces and ionic bonds.208,209 Non-covalent inhibitors are characterized by their ability to bind to the active site of the target protein with a higher affinity than the target proteins natural substrate.210,211 Together these non-covalent interactions establish a stable drug-protein complex which results in the inhibition of the activity of the target protein. | The warhead group is crucial for this process but can also lead to side effects if it reacts with unintended proteins.211,215 Accordingly, the warhead group is essential for this covalent reaction and plays a key role in the potential side effects of covalent inhibitors. | Despite the apparent advantages of covalent inhibitors over their traditional non-covalent counterparts, covalent inhibitors suffer from several limitations. | Such simulations have been proven to be crucial for the understanding and development of non-covalent inhibitors over the years. | Modulating these interactions with targeted PPI modulators offers the potential to resolve many clinical conditions driven by such aberrant PPIs. As such PPI modulation is a vast field which would require a book to comprehensively cover all aspects of the topic.218223 This section highlights successful strategies used to develop PPI modulators with significant potential for advancing clinical applications in cancer, inflammatory, and autoimmune disorders, as well as antiviral therapies (Table 2).Table 2Key examples of clinical applications

small molecule PPIs for SAR analysis was based on the availability of sufficient data to support the prediction of their SAR profiles and their amenability to further optimization in future research endeavors. | Among the various PPIs related to the development and progression of cancer, this section will focus on c-MycMax inhibitors and K-RASPDE complexes PPI inhibitors. | c-MycMax inhibitors c-Myc is an oncogenic transcription factor that is characterized by a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-ZIP) domain.239 c-Myc regulation involves tightly controlled expression and post-transcriptional stabilization mechanisms which are managed via growth-promoting signals.240 In genetic model systems, the conditional induction of c-Myc overexpression has been demonstrated to trigger tumorigenesis, while deactivation of the c-Myc-encoding transgene leads to sustained tumor regression.241,242 The biological activity of c-Myc is intrinsically dependent on the formation of a heterodimer with its partner protein Max.243 Unlike the monomeric form of c-Myc, the c-MycMax heterodimer adopts a structured coiled-coil configuration possessing 70 α-helical content, which escalates to 84 upon binding to DNA.244 The signaling pathway of c-MycMax is illustrated in Fig. | Created by Biorender The c-MycMax interaction can be disrupted by two main therapeutic approaches of which the first involves inhibiting the c-MycMax PPI while the second exploits the stabilization of Max homodimers thereby limiting the availability of Max for association with c-Myc.245,246 The first approach directly targets the PPI between c-Myc and Max using small molecules which are designed to bind to the interface where c-Myc and Max interact which prevents the formation of the c-MycMax complex.247,248 The second strategy takes a more indirect approach by stabilizing Max homodimers with the aim of promoting the formation of Max homodimers to limit the availability of free Max.249251 However, the approach of stabilizing Max homodimers is associated with unintended consequences on other Max functions. | c-MycMax small molecule inhibitors Direct c-Myc small molecule Inhibitors: The main approach that has been used to modulate the c-MycMax interaction has been the direct targeting of one of the three distinct binding sites present in the 85-residue bHLH-ZIP domain of the c-Myc transcription factor.258,259 These three binding sites are present in the region defined by residues 363-381 which are located at the junction between the DNA-binding domain and helix 1. | When small molecule inhibitors bind to these sites, localized conformational alterations are introduced that maintain the general disorder of c-Myc while preventing its dimerization with Max. | 5SARs and

para-substituent of the benzofurazan ring, a molecular edit that resulted in a significant increase in both inhibitory activity and solubility. | Additionally, while the cells retained 2 for extended periods, a significant portion became localized within the cytoplasm which reduced the Myc inhibitory activity. | c-MycMax heterodimer small molecule inhibitors: The second approach employed to develop c-MycMax small molecule inhibitors involves the use of α-helix mimetics aimed at the disruption of the coiled-coil structure that mediates the c-MycMax heterodimer interaction. | This approach prevents the heterodimer from binding to DNA without inducing the dissociation into the monomeric c-Myc and Max components.268 This strategy holds substantial promise since it overcomes the inability of direct c-Myc inhibitors to disrupt established dimers which are characterized as possessing a high free energy of proteinprotein association.239,258,269 This hypothesis was validated by a novel series of biphenyl-based α-helix mimetics which demonstrated the ability to bind to the helical form of c-Myc. | 5e and show that bulky hydrophobic substituents such as phenyl and biphenyl rings at the R1 position significantly enhanced inhibitory activity. | Electron-withdrawing substituents such as NO2 at the R3 position are essential for inhibitory activity while both phenyl rings were found to be amenable to isosteric replacement by pyridine. | The presence of the isopropyl and carboxylic acid moieties on the benzoic acid ring were identified as crucial for the expression of inhibitory activity. | This was highlighted by significant decreases in c-MycMax inhibitory activity when the acid was converted to an ester or an amide or the isopropyl group was replaced with larger aliphatic or aromatic groups. | This loss in activity suggests that these groups play key roles in the binding interaction or the structural configuration contributing to the inhibitors binding shape. | Among the synthesized compounds, 4 (Fig. | Meanwhile, one of the main factors associated with toxicity in small molecules is the presence of structural fragments, commonly referred to as toxicophores, that can be associated with adverse outcomes.270,271 One such a toxicophore is the nitro group that is present in 4 and which could be a contributing factor to the observed toxicity due to the reported metabolic activation of the NO2 moiety to a nitrenium species that is a known mutagen. | Direct c-Myc small molecule stabilizers: KI-MS2-008 (5) is an asymmetric polycyclic lactam identified through screening of unbiased small molecule microarrays which represents a groundbreaking approach to combating Myc-driven cancers.249 KI-MS2-008 (5) directly binds to Max and stabilizes homodimer formation (IC50 2.15 μM after 3 days) which lead to mimicry of the effect of Myc loss. | These findings offer compelling evidence for targeting Max as a viable cancer therapy strategy and mark 5 as a valuable tool for the development of improved therapeutics and further exploration of Max as a promising drug target.249 c-MycMax protein-based inhibitors The intrinsically disordered nature of MYC means that it is undergoing constant changes which complicates the design of small molecule inhibitors due to the lack of a stable binding pocket.274,275 The disordered nature of MYC has directed effort toward finding alternate therapeutic options for MYC inhibition. | Omomyc mini proteins have demonstrated the unique ability of targeting all three forms of MYC which prevents the activation of genes typically controlled by MYC.277279 Omomyc was initially used as a MYC inhibitor within cells and later demonstrated efficacy against transformed cells while minimally affecting normal cell proliferation.279281 Interestingly, the theorized application of Omomyc was originally deemed implausible due to the difficulty of achieving a deliverable expression of Omomyc peptides and lack of translation to in vivo models.278,282 Subsequent testing in mouse models revealed Omomyc to possess efficacy and a remarkable therapeutic window across various tumor types, regardless of their origin or driving mutations. | K-RAS PPI inhibitors The RAS family, composed of H-, K-, and N-RAS, are oncoproteins that have been heavily linked with cancer development and tumor promotion, with RAS mutations occurring in about 2030 of human cancers.284,285 The RAS family acts as membrane-bound molecular switches when activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that promote the change from the inactive GDP-bound state to an active GTP-bound state.284,286 The activated GTP-RAS initiates a downstream signaling pathway that, in turn, leads to the activation of various effectors including PDEδ, PI3K, RAF, AFAD, TIAM1, and IMPA1 among many others (Fig. | Together, these observations highlight K-RAS as a key therapeutic target for anticancer drug development.295,296 The development of K-RAS-targeted therapeutics has been hindered by its relatively flat surfaces and picomolar affinity for nucleotides.297,298 However, the recent approval of MG510 (sotorasib) and MRTX840 (adagrasib) highlight the druggability potential of the G12C form of K-RAS.16,17 K-RAS small molecule inhibitors This section presents examples of specific K-RAS small molecule inhibitors by focusing on their binding mechanisms and SAR. | While the approaches described above yielded potent K-RAS inhibitors, their potential clinical application is currently limited due to their reported non-specific cytotoxicity or low cellular uptake. | The nucleotide-binding site and the switch II pocket, which are located within the G domain of GTPase proteins, have been shown to be amenable to modulation by small molecule inhibitors. | 7K-RAS Protein Structure And the K-RAS nucleotide binding site compound 6. | b Chemical structure of compound 6 and key pharmacophoric features associated with its scaffold K-RAS nucleotide binding site small molecule inhibitors The sub-nanomolar affinity of both GTP and GDP for RAS coupled with their abundant concentrations within cells has hampered efforts to develop small molecules that can inhibit RAS via competing with GTP and GDP at the guanine nucleotide binding site of the GTPases. | Additionally, the charged nature of the phosphate groups of 6 and its derivatives rendered the compounds unable to cross the cell membrane which calls for further development if a viable clinical candidate is to be identified. | K-RAS allosteric site small molecule inhibitors The switch II pocket (S-IIP) resides at the interface of the α2-helix (switch-II), α3-helix, and the core β-sheet of the RAS protein. | The S-IIP presents an allosteric target distinct from the nucleotide-binding site and has emerged as a promising target for the development of mutant-specific K-RAS inhibitors. | After the discovery of the S-IIP, various efforts were performed in order to identify covalent small molecule inhibitors capable of targeting the S-IIP which culminated in the FDA approval of sotorasib (9) in 2021 as the first targeted therapy for tumors harboring a K-RAS mutation.16,307 This was followed by the approval of adagrasib (10) in 2022 as a second distinct scaffold targeting the K-RAS G12C mutation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with prior systemic therapy.17,308 While both adagrasib and sotorasib are successful examples of drug development targeting the allosteric S-IIP, the greater availability of reported sotorasib derivatives and their respective biological activity when compared to adagrasib offers a more comprehensive understanding of its SARs and optimization pathway.307,309 The development of sotorasib began with the discovery of the indole-based small molecule inhibitor 7 which was capable of occupying a previously unexploited cryptic pocket on the surface of K-RAS located at the S-IIP (Fig. | To address these shortcomings, a hybridization strategy was performed in which key elements of 7 were combined with 8, a quinazoline-based covalent S-IIP inhibitor which suffered from low K-RAS potency. | While these modifications led to increased inhibitory activity, the hybrid molecules suffered from low inhibitory solubility and poor membrane permeability.Fig. | Combined contour map of all features: Overlaid mesh representation of all factors from (II) to (VI) Rational drug design efforts revealed that incorporating a nitrogen atom into the quinazolinone ring resulted in an azaquinazolinone that demonstrated significantly improved membrane permeability and inhibitory activity. | These efforts led to the successful discovery and development of sotorasib (9) highlighting how rational design efforts can lead to a viable clinical candidate as well as emphasizing the considerable potential of PPIs. Taking advantage of the available biological data for the various derivatives of sotorasib (9), we attempted to identify the 3D quantitative structureactivity relationships (3D QSARs) associated with 9 and its analogs to elucidate the relationship between the K-RAS inhibitory activity exhibited by the compounds and the key structural features. | Additionally, substituting the pyridine ring with hydrogen bond acceptors was predicted to enhance the K-RAS inhibitory activity. | These findings identify the relationship between the pharmacophoric features 9 and its K-RAS inhibitory activity which provides a roadmap for future attempts at improving the potency. | The QSAR contour map based on the K-RAS inhibitory activity of sotorasib (9) and its derivatives is illustrated in Fig. | Additionally, the FDA approval of 9 not only underscores the potential of hybridization strategies but also reinforces the validity of using small molecules to target PPIs. Moreover, the QSAR analysis of 9 and its derivatives highlight how optimization of small molecules can be carried out by exploiting existing data to rapidly identify and visualize pharmacophoric sites that can be used for lead optimization. | Gp130IL-6 inhibitors Cytokines are signaling proteins with short lifespans which are involved in cell communication via acting through autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine signaling pathways.318321 Among the different cytokines, the IL-6 family of cytokines stands out for its reliance on a common signaling subunit, glycoprotein 130 kDa (gp130).322329 The Gp130 receptor contains three domains: an extracellular region for ligand binding, a transmembrane segment anchoring the receptor to the cell membrane, and a cytoplasmic domain responsible for intracellular signaling. | Meanwhile, other members of the cytokine family, such as the ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and Oncostatin M (OSM), require a heterodimeric complex to initiate signaling. | The proinflammatory activities of IL-6 are mediated by IL-6 trans-signaling via the sIL-6R, whereas the protective and anti-inflammatory activities of IL-6 are mainly executed via the membrane-bound IL- 6R (classic signaling).341344 gp130IL-6 small molecule inhibitors The development of small-molecule inhibitors for gp130 has become a significant area of research over the last two decades. | Targeting of this common binding site within gp130 has led to dual inhibitory effects on both IL-6 and IL-11 activation. | Studies have revealed that these small-molecule inhibitors interact with specific hot spots on the D1 domain at three main sites: Leu57, Trp157, and an extra binding site. | Recent perspectives have examined the potential of gp130 as a drug target for small molecule development as well as detailed analyses of the SARs and binding potential of small molecule inhibitors targeting gp130.99,345 IL-6IL-6Rαgp130 mAbs While there are no FDA-approved gp130IL-6 small molecule inhibitors, significant progress has been made in developing antibody-based therapeutics.99,346348 Currently, the FDA has approved four IL-6R mAbs for clinical use: tocilizumab, siltuximab, sarilumab and satralizumab in 2010, 2014, 2017, and 2020, respectively.15,349351 Among the four mAbs, tocilizumab was the first to be approved and paved the way for the subsequent development of the other mAbs. | Tocilizumab exerts its IL-6 inhibitory action by directly binding to the IL-6R receptor, thereby preventing IL-6 from binding to gp130. | Additionally, tocilizumab has been reported to cause the dissociation of pre-formed IL-6sIL-6R complexes which disrupts existing signaling and further strengthens its inhibitory action on the IL-6 pathway.13,355359 Extensive clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of tocilizumab in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients which has led to its approval for treating moderate to severe RA in various countries, including the USA and the EU.360 It has also been approved for the treatment of giant cell arteritis, systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and cytokine release syndrome. | Studies have shown that adding tocilizumab to standard COVID-19 treatment regimens significantly reduces mortality rates and the need for hospitalization or ventilation.361363 The diverse therapeutic applications of these IL-6 inhibitors underscore the potential of targeting gp130IL-6 signaling as a broad strategy for managing inflammatory diseases. | 10).371373 These transcription factors that are subject to 14-3-3 modulation include the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription protein (JAK-STAT), and the estrogen receptor (ER).374376 Additionally, 14-3-3ζ was reported to be an endogenous suppressor of inflammatory arthritis.366 Consequently, the development of PPI modulators targeting 14-3-3 holds promise for treating chronic inflammatory diseases linked to aberrant 14-3-3 levels. | Optimization of 11, a known Fusicoccin A (FC-A) based compound, has led to the development of a series of molecular glues with the ability to selectively modulate either the 14-3-3ERα or 14-3-3GR PPIs.377,378 While 13 exhibited weak stabilization of the 14-3-3GR interaction, its racemic mixture lacked selectivity towards either GR or ERα. | This selectivity held true for other FC-A derivatives, indicating the importance of stereoisomerism on compound selectivity. | While this series of 14-3-3 small molecule stabilizers exhibits considerable potential due to a promising selectivity profile and potency, two major drawbacks are apparent. | These esters are readily cleaved by enzymes in the body which would lead to the release of the active compound at the target site.379,380 Much like PPI inhibitors, molecular glues can bind to their target site in either a reversible or irreversible (covalent) manner. | 11c overlayed over the most potent compound, 14. | Additionally, X-ray cocrystallography was employed to identify the best orientation for binding which inspired the rigidification of the linker moiety, thereby stabilizing the compound in a preferred conformation. | Peptidomimetic 14-3-3 inhibitors Significant effort has been made toward the development of peptidomimetics that can disrupt phosphorylation sites recognizing phosphotyrosine or phosphoserinethreonine motifs which mediate a range of protein-protein interactions, including those involving 14-3-3 proteins.382386 The first peptidomimetic (15, Fig. | This screening process identified five promising fragments with strong binding from which 15 was designed by strategically combining the fragments leading to a molecule with a potent inhibitory effect on the 14-3-3σ isoform, IC50 2.6 μM. | 1214-3-3 inhibitors peptides and peptidomimetic inhibitors. | Once 16 was inside the cell, enzymatic-mediated cleavage of the nitrofurfuryl group and subsequent intracellular cyclization of an intermediate produced an intermediate prone to spontaneous hydrolysis which afforded the biologically active phosphonate peptidomimetic 17.390 Peptide based 14-3-3 inhibitors The discovery and optimization of the peptide-based 14-3-3 inhibitor R18 (18) highlighted the potential of peptides to modulate 14-3-3 proteins.391 R18 (18) is a composed of 20 residues with a high affinity for the canonical amphipathic binding groove of 14-3-3 proteins. | Functional assays of the extended peptide demonstrated superior inhibitory activity against 14-3-3 PPIs and the ability to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. | The development of 18 underscores the therapeutic potential of targeting 14-3-3 PPIs using peptides and developing targeted therapeutics.393,394 Antiviral inhibitors of PPIs One novel application of PPI modulators is the inhibition of viral infections by targeting the interactions between viral and host proteins or between viral proteins.50,395 Viruses are simple organisms with sophisticated mechanisms of hijacking host cell processes to ensure reproduction and propogation.396 Since the viral reproduction process typically involves a series of PPIs between viral and host cell proteins, PPI inhibitors can disrupt these interactions to inhibit viral replication.397 Antiviral PPI inhibitors may offer several advantages over therapies that target viral enzymes and can be more resistant to mutations that engender drug resistance.398,399 These advantages stem from several factors among which is their ability to target large and flat surfaces on proteins. | This property of PPIs can render them less susceptible to resistance development when compared to traditional inhibitors that target specific active sites. | Additionally, viruses may have functional redundancy in their enzymatic activities which provides aid in overcoming inhibitors through mutations. | Conversely, disrupting critical PPIs can be more detrimental to the virus, as these interactions are often integral to the viral lifecycle and less likely to have redundant pathways.400,401 Another advantage of antiviral PPI inhibitors over traditional therapeutics lies in their ability to disrupt essential interactions that are critical for viral replication.402,403 Studies have shown promise in targeting PPIs for diverse viruses like HIV-1, coronaviruses, and influenza virus with varying degree of success.404411 One of the promising applications for antiviral PPI inhibitors is for the treatment of HIV-1 which subtends acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a global health crisis which affects over 38 million people worldwide and is the result of the progressive depletion of T lymphocytes.395,412 HIV-1 exhibits high infectivity and transmission rates413,414 and infects target cells in a series of well-defined steps. | Antiviral agents that disrupt any step of the HIV-1 entry process are classified as entry inhibitors.417 These drugs are particularly valuable for heavily treatment experienced (HTE) individuals who have limited treatment options due to the acquisition of extensive drug resistance.418,419 Typically used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs as part of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens, entry inhibitors prevent viral entry by targeting specific steps in the process (Fig. | There are three main categories of entry inhibitors based on their mechanism of action: 1) attachment inhibitors (AIs) which block the initial encounter between virus and host cell either by binding to host CD4 proteins or virus gp120, 2) CCR5 or CXCR4 antagonists which bind to the respective coreceptors to interrupt association with gp120 and the liberation of gp41 and 3) fusion inhibitors which interact directly with gp41 to interfere with the cell membrane fusion process. | The success and potential of antiviral PPI inhibitors is highlighted by the FDA-approval of the AI temsavir, administered as its prodrug fostemsavir, and maraviroc, a CCR5 antagonist.420,421Fig. | Inhibition of HIV-1 by attachment inhibitors (b) and CCR5 antagonists (c). | Created by Biorender When compared to traditional antiviral therapeutics, antiviral protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibitors offer several advantages. | Traditional antivirals typically target viral enzymes or structural proteins, often leading to the rapid emergence of drug-resistant viral strains due to high mutation rates.422,423 In contrast, PPI inhibitors disrupt the interactions between viral proteins and their host cell counterparts which are generally more conserved and less prone to mutations.424 This reduces the likelihood of resistance development. | Additionally, targeting PPIs can interfere with multiple stages of the viral lifecycle leading to potentially increasing therapeutic efficacy.425,426 PPI inhibitors can also be designed to modulate host factors essential for viral replication, thereby broadening the scope of antiviral targets and potentially offering cross-protection against diverse viruses.402,427 Moreover, advancements in structural biology and computational chemistry have enhanced the design and optimization of PPI inhibitors, improving their specificity and reducing off-target effects. | These attributes make antiviral PPI inhibitors a promising alternative to traditional antiviral therapies, offering the potential for more durable and broadly effective treatments. | HIV-1 small molecule PPI inhibitors The HIV-1 AI temsavir (20) binds to a specific region on the HIV-1 envelope gp120 adjacent to the CD4 binding pocket in a fashion that pushes the β20-β21 and Trp427 loops into the CD4 binding pocket428,429 thereby stabilizing the viral envelope protein in a conformation unable to bind to CD4 but which interestingly, is targeted by some broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) including V1V2-directed bNAbs.430,431 The prototype for 20 was discovered with a HTS using a non-infectious HIV-1 pseudovirus assay to screen 100,000 compounds from the Bristol Myers Squibb corporate library which surfaced the promising lead compound 19 which displayed an EC50 value of 153 nM.432434 Extensive optimization efforts ultimately yielded 20 which exhibited significantly improved potency (EC50 0.1 nM) and a broader HIV-1 inhibitory spectrum.435437 However, the poor aqueous solubility of 20 resulted in an inadequate pharmacokinetic performance, a deficiency overcome by exploiting the phosphonooxymethyl prodrug found in fostemsavir (21), the marketed form. | 14HIV-1 small molecule PPI inhibitors design strategies. | Subsequent efforts focused on mitigating the compounds hERG channel inhibition by adding polar amide substituents which led to the replacement of the benzimidazole core with a triazole featuring a simple methyl group (24). | This raised safety concerns about drug-drug interactions, particularly with HIV-1 treatment regimens which depend fundamentally on the use of combination therapy that can include CYP 450 inhibitors such as ritonavir. | Phase 3 trials of ibalizumab demonstrated its safety, tolerability, and potential for monotherapy in patients suffering from multidrug resistance and revealed significant antiviral activity (1 log10 viral load reduction) with weekly intravenous dosing.457 The long half-life of ibalizumab combined with its unique mechanism of action reduces the risk of cross-resistance and offers promise as a viable therapeutic solution to multidrug resistance.458 Peptide-based PPI inhibitors of HIV-1 infection A number of studies have been performed with the objective of developing peptides capable of disrupting the formation of the six-helix bundle (6-HB) within gp41 that is a critical step in HIV-1 infection. | The peptides competitively bind to the exposed NHR or CHR in the pre-hairpin conformation of gp41 which prevents the formation of the 6-HB and ultimately blocks the fusion of virus and cellular membranes.459,460 Among the various efforts undertaken to develop peptide-based HIV PPI inhibitors, the development of sifuvirtide provides valuable lessons for future PPI inhibitor design.461463 Enfuvirtide (T20FuzeonTM) is a 36-amino acid CHR-derived peptide which in 2003 was the first HIV-1 fusion inhibitor approved for clinical use.464 However, its effectiveness was hampered by the development of resistance as well as fibrillation (aggregation), a common problem with peptide-based therapeutics.465467 One approach to address this limitation involved the use of cucurbiturils (CB), a water-soluble macrocycle that can specifically bind to the C-terminal Phe residue of enfuvirtide leading to the modulation of its fibrillation behavior and potentially improving stability.468 Optimization of enfuvirtide led to the discovery of the second generation agent T1249.469 Unfortunately, T1249 suffered from formulation challenges which led to further refinement and the discovery of sifuvirtide.470 Sifuvirtide is a third generation, electrostatically-constrained, α-helical peptide with potent anti-HIV-1 activity, a good safety profile, and favorable pharmacokinetic properties.463 Subsequent studies revealed that the emergence of resistance to sifuvirtide could be overcome by introducing methionine and threonine (MT) amino acids in the pocket-binding domain to yield MT-sifuvirtide. | For example, a PPI where there are well-defined binding sites with clear binding cavities would be an ideal target for the development of small molecule-based modulators. | The nature of these interfaces makes it difficult to design small molecules that selectively bind to a specific target without interfering with others. | The FDA approval of small molecule PPI inhibitors such as tocilizumab, siltuximab, sarilumab, satralizumab, sotorasib, adagrasib, maraviroc, venetoclax14,50 and fostemsavir serve as tangible evidence of the therapeutic potential of targeting PPIs. These achievements underscore the transformative impact of this approach, elevating PPIs from the realm of potential to the exciting reality of clinically validated targets.","##I (MISC), ##I (MISC), ##I (MISC), ##I (MISC), ##I (MISC)"

glycolysis inhibitors such as 2-Deoxy-D-glucose; glutaminolysis inhibitors such as CB-839 or DON prodrugs) . | Additionally, more than 60 ongoing clinical trials are testing KDs in combination with standard, immune-based, and other targeted approaches (such as PI3K inhibitors), in GBM and other solid malignancies . | Conversely, there has been extensive preclinical development of pharmacological inhibitors aimed at nearly all metabolic pathways identified as upregulated or aberrant in cancer, subsequently added to various SOC regimens upon reaching clinical testing (without dietary intervention) . | While we hypothesize that neoplastic cells are comparatively more susceptible to metabolic stress due to SLP dependency, mutational burden, and dysregulated growth itself, we aim to minimize off-target effects by following the press-pulse therapeutic principle, where drugs with a narrow therapeutic index (such as cytotoxic agents or metabolic inhibitors) are carefully dose-escalated and applied intermittently on a metabolic priming dietary KMT baseline . | In this scenario, the utility of KMT is being demonstrated to enhance the anti-tumor effects of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted approaches (e.g., VEGF and immune checkpoint inhibitors) across different cancer models, via reductions in tumor nutrient utilization, hypoxia, inflammation, invasion, and angiogenesis, as well as regulation of pathways mediating tumor growth such as mTOR, insulin-PI3K, AMPK-PGC-1α, autophagy, epigenetic signaling, immune recognition, and multiple other pleiotropic mechanisms . | It is an implicit assumption that clinical studies exploring precision nutrition or single metabolic inhibitors as adjuncts with SOC will be carried out in parallel, particularly for tumors where SOC offers a well-established track record of survival benefit; in cases where SOC may be deemed insufficient (as determined by the patient), a conceptual reframing of KMT at the foundational level may provide an ethical opportunity to explore the effectiveness of standalone diet-drug metabolic targeting. | In a similar way, the active monitoring period in low-grade gliomas confers an ethical opportunity for the evaluation of non-toxic therapeutic strategies such as dietary KMT, following the recent example of dual inhibitors of mutant IDH12 enzymes, which have been tested specifically to delay the potential long-term toxic effects of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy . | Dietary and pharmacological KMT could include a combination of GKI-adjusted KDs (with or without caloric restriction), fasting, and drugadjuvant therapies (e.g., metabolic inhibitors, drug repurposing, investigational compounds, hyperbaric medicine, hyperthermia, photosonodynamic approaches), with elective and protractible 6-week delay of chemotherapy andor radiotherapy prior to image-based reevaluation. | Drug treatmentsIdeally, all drug treatments (especially metabolic inhibitors and chemotherapy) should be administered in a GKI 2.0 range. | After achieving a therapeutic GKI-adjusted baseline, glycolysis and glutaminolysis should be targeted simultaneously; various diet-drug combinations can be evaluated to this effect (e.g., targeting insulin signaling via repurposed drugs such as metformin or SGLT2 inhibitors, or direct metabolic inhibition using research-phase glucose and glutamine antagonists). | The fundamental bioenergetic hierarchy of normal cells (OXPHOS SLP) and cancer cells (OXPHOS SLP) should not be forgotten when developing mitochondria-targeting drugs, such as electron transport chain inhibitors . | In asymptomatic or slow-growing tumors, active surveillance provides an opportunity to implement dietary KMT as a neuroprotective intervention prior to surgery, which could reduce angiogenesis, inflammation, and edema , and thus potentially facilitate better surgical delineation when coupled with metabolic imaging and intraoperative markers . | Alternatives allowing for dose reduction include combinatory regimens of non-steroidal medications such as COX-2 inhibitors, fingolimod, acetazolamide, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, ACE inhibitors, or glyburide (which impacts insulin signaling) ; nutraceuticals such as boswellic acids ; as well as novel agents such as corticorelin acetate, vaptans and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), or vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase (VE-PTP) antagonists . | 5 and can be structured as follows:Dietary KMT (GKI-adjusted KDKD-R and fasting) reduces the glycolytic dependency of normal tissues and stimulates compensatory ketone body metabolism.If the tumor is shown to be glycolytic (i.e., high 18F-FDG uptake), consider additional systemic targeting of substrate, such as renal glucose reabsorption or gluconeogenesis inhibitors (e.g., SGLT2 inhibitors, metformin). | At this time, one of the anti-glutaminolytic drugs considered to work best as part of KMT in preclinical models is the pan-glutaminase inhibitor 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) . | Any prospective compound that can safely and effectively target glutamine availability andor utilization may elicit comparable effects, such as DON prodrugs or novel glutaminase inhibitors . | Safe administration of metabolic inhibitors will require physiological adaptation to a GKI-adjusted KDKD-R, which can be accelerated by water-only fasting. | Then, glycolysis targeting can be considered to further improve GKI and slow tumor progression (e.g., antidiabetic agents such as metformin or SGLT2 inhibitors, as well as research-phase glycolytic inhibitors). | Glutaminolysis should be targeted at the same time (e.g., sodium phenylbutyrate, DON, or novel glutamine inhibitors). | Further improvements to GKI (substrate availability) and direct targeting of glycolysis can be implemented after ketogenic adaptation via drug repurposing or investigational compounds, depending on the clinical context (Additional File 5: Table S2). | At this time, we do not recommend OXPHOS inhibitors with higher potency, such as IACS-010759, due to unacceptable off-target toxicity . | SGLT2 inhibitors (e.g., dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, canagliflozin) can be considered to further decrease GKI and insulin signaling ; dose adjustments and monitoring of ketoacidosis is required during KDs and fasting, especially in patients with a history of type 2 diabetes or prone to ketoacidosis . | SGLT2 inhibitors experienced a recent resurgence as attractive combinations with PI3K inhibitors via suppression of the insulin feedback loop; however, greater synergy was observed with the KD in certain preclinical models, even if future clinical adoption would be more demanding . | Therefore, a dual combination of low-dose SGLT2 inhibitors and KDs warrants further research. | In fact, the KD is now being rebranded as insulin suppressing and trials with PI3K inhibitors are underway . | Other antidiabetic drugs that do not act through endogenous insulin production, such as thiazolidinediones (glitazones), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (gliptins), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists or bromocriptine, could be tools to achieve and sustain specific GKI ranges. | Beyond systemic glucose availability, several research-phase chemicals that target the glycolytic pathway at the substrate, transport, or enzyme level have been explored in clinical trials, such as the classical competitive inhibitor 2-Deoxy-D-glucose . | In our view, effective and sustained ketogenic adaptation at the biological level should be a prerequisite for the clinical testing of glycolytic inhibitors. | Currently, novel glutamine antagonists and other metabolic inhibitors such as DON prodrugs or CB-839 are being tested as monotherapy additions to SOC (Additional File 5: Table S2). | While DON prodrugs with improved oral bioavailability are being developed, the original compound demonstrated biological activity at oral doses up to 1.1 mgkgday for a duration of two or more weeks . | It is also being investigated as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor . | Phenylbutyrate decreases systemic availability of glutamine, resulting in substrate competition; thus, similar to PEG-glutaminase, phenylbutyrate-induced glutamine depletion may be explored to reduce dosing requirements of DON or other enzyme-level inhibitors of glutaminolysis . | Consequently, it has been proposed that combinations with specific glutaminolysis inhibitors such as DON may further improve therapeutic efficacy . | Other research-phase glutamine inhibitors include the aforementioned DON prodrugs (e.g., JHU-083 and DRP-104, which contain the same active compound but aim to improve bioavailability and pharmacodynamics; Azo-DON, which is selectively reduced to DON by azo-reductases in hypoxic environments; as well as azotomycin, a tripeptide diazo analog) , CB-839 (telaglenastat), IPN60090, BPTES, and compound 968 (glutaminase inhibitors) , V-9302 (glutamine transport inhibitor) , azaserine and acivicin (glutamine mimics) , and caudatan A , physapubescin K , and aspulvinone O . | Telaglenastat is an investigational, first-in-clinic, small molecule oral selective inhibitor of GLS1, which has reached up to phase II clinical trials in advanced solid and hematological malignancies, including IDH-mutant astrocytoma . | Repurposed drugs with potential inhibitory effects on the glutaminolytic pathway include aminooxyacetate, apomorphine, tamoxifenraloxifene, sulfasalazine, and ceftriaxone . | Over-the-counter nutraceuticals with direct or indirect effects include EGCG , xanthohumol and hesperidin , ursolic acid , caffeic acid , curcumin , apigenin , berberine , and other compounds with only preliminary mechanistic evidence . | Patients are therefore encouraged to inquire about ongoing clinical trials or compassionate use of glutaminolysis inhibitors (such as DON, novel DON prodrugs, or CB-839). | Beyond metabolism, several targeted therapies based on mutational heterogeneity have been evaluated in clinical trials with arguably underwhelming results; these include growth and signaling pathways with known alterations in GBM, as well as multi-kinase inhibitors and immunotherapies . | Early trials of checkpoint inhibitors in GBM failed to show efficacy due to the relatively immunoprivileged nature of the CNS . | We refer to additional reviews discussing novel compounds and off-label indications with preclinical evidence that may hold promise but require further clinical testing . | It is important to note that this list is based on preexisting clinical use (drug repurposing) and may not involve the most potent or selective compounds in their respective category;

neuroprotective efficacy of triolein during the acute phase of IS. | Furthermore, our study revealed that triolein exerts an inhibitory effect on the inflammatory response and autophagy through AKTmTOR signaling pathway activation, concurrently enhancing OGDR-induced HT22 cell viability. | In the present study, autophagy inhibitor BafA1 was used to inhibit autophagy in vitro before detecting inflammation. | To clarify whether the AKTmTOR signaling pathway participates in the neuroprotective function of triolein in IS, this study selected GSK-690,693 to inhibit AKT function, followed by detecting changes in the expression of Atg and inflammatory factors and assessing OGDR-induced HT22 injury. | In both in vivo and in vitro experiments, inhibiting the AKTmTOR signaling pathway with GSK-690,693 significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of triolein on inflammation (Figs. | Overall, these results indicate the involvement of the AKTmTOR signaling pathway in the crucial function of triolein in exerting anti-inflammatory effects and inhibitory effects on autophagy in IS-induced brain injury. | Additionally, further studies of trioleins complex mechanisms are anticipated to advance the development of neuroprotective drugs to make them safer and more effective. | The prospect of triolein as an IS drug appears promising, especially given its demonstrated ability to regulate key pathways involved in neuroprotection. | Conclusion In conclusion, our study elucidates, for the first time, the neuroprotective role of triolein in IS, achieved through autophagy-dependent inhibition of the post-IS inflammatory response. | Furthermore, the neuroprotective effects of triolein are intricately linked to the AKTmTOR signaling pathway.","IS (MISC), IS

11624716.xml,Co-evolution of glioma and immune microenvironment,"Standard of care for gliomas consists of maximal safe resection and in high-grade gliomas (grade 3 or 4) adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy.3 4 Postoperative management in grade 2 tumors is not as well defined but often based on risk stratification with low-risk patients (eg, aged 40 years with absent or modest asymptomatic residual tumor not needing immediate adjuvant treatments) being eligible for a watch and wait period where they can be observed without any treatments for further progression.4 The prognosis of gliomas varies based on their molecular features.5 For example, IDH-mutant gliomas are less aggressive than IDH-wildtype gliomas, even when an IDH-mutant astrocytoma has necrosis andor microvascular proliferation, which are traditional histological hallmarks of GBM.6 Additional studies have highlighted other genomic alterations, such as homozygous deletion of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) andor cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B (CDKN2B) genes, that affect prognosis and response to therapies.7 Such studies highlight the importance of understanding the molecular features of gliomas and how they may change as gliomas evolve and affect responses to emerging therapeutics. | For example, a phase III randomized study in newly diagnosed GBM of immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab, in combination with standard-of-care radiotherapy and temozolomide, did not improve progression-free or overall survival compared with placebo.16 In another phase III clinical trial, nivolumab did not improve overall survival compared with bevacizumab in patients with recurrent GBM.17 The limited efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors may be partially due to the paucity of neoantigens, the plasticity of glioma cells to escape immune clearance, and the immunosuppressive TME.14 A plethora of recent studies have focused on characterizing the immune components of the TME, demonstrating that tumor-infiltrating immune cells including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), neutrophils, dendritic cells, and T-cell lymphocytes are critical determinants of tumor progression and outcomes.18 These cells can be co-opted by glioma cells to promote an immunosuppressive environment and tumor growth via various mechanisms, including secretion of chemokines and cytokines that alter the balance of protumor and antitumor immune responses.19 The advent of high-throughput sequencing methods and spatiotemporal microscopy have allowed an in-depth examination of glioma composition and structure at unprecedented resolution and scale. | Common pathways activated in cancer stem cells, including signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)42 and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB),43 may be induced through immune TME factors (figure 1). | BMAL1, basic helix-loop-helix ARNT-like protein 1; CCL, chemokine ligand; CLOCK,

microenvironment; Treg, regulatory T cell. | Indeed, GSCs have been shown to secrete factors including IL-10, macrophage-inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1), and TGF-β to suppress the antitumor function of TAMs and reprogram them to an immunosuppressive, protumor M2-like phenotype.56 Periostin secreted by GSCs has also been shown to modulate TAM recruitment and promote an immunosuppressive state. | Classically, 2-HG acts as a competitive inhibitor of alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent enzymes which include important DNA and histone demethylases, such as a-ketoglutarate-dependent ten eleven translocation enzymes and Jumonji C domain-containing dioxygenases. | In addition to 2-HG modulation of TME immune cells, recent studies have also demonstrated a direct, cell-autonomous role for IDH1 mutations in modulating innate immunity through epigenetic silencing of the cGAS-STING signaling and attenuation of IFN-γ production.73 74 Importantly, these IDH-mutant effects can be reversed with IDH-mutant inhibitors. | It will be interesting to investigate whether such inhibitors can act synergistically with immune checkpoint inhibitors to improve their efficacy. | Glioma cells can promote TAM recruitment through the secretion of various chemokines including monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (also known as CCL2), CCL7, CXCL12, colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1), lysyl oxidase and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor.76 Genomic alterations in glioma cells such as NF1 deficiency,14 PTEN deficiency,77 and EGFR overexpression and its truncation mutant variant (EGFRvIII)78 can induce expression of these chemokines to promote TAM infiltration into the TME. | Patients with higher-grade gliomas have increased Tregs and reduced CD4T cells.91 Various factors produced by gliomas can induce Treg infiltration including CCL22 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) mediated secreted factors.76 Tregs production of immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-10, IL-35, and TGF-β), conversion of ATP to adenosine, and consumption of IL-2 contribute to the inhibition of antitumor cytotoxic T cells.76 Tregs can also express cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) that suppresses the function of APCs92 and secrete granzyme or perforin molecules to destroy effector cells.93 Downregulation of MHC-I expression through modulation of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING)-type I IFN pathway has also been shown to limit T-cell activation in glioma TME.9496 T-cell anergy, whereby lymphocytes become perpetually unresponsive following antigen exposure, in GBM has been attributed to diminished IL-2 cytokine production required for T-cell clonal expansion.97 T-cell exhaustion is marked by a hyporesponsive state of T cells with increased inhibitory receptors, decreased effector cytokines and impaired cytotoxicity. | For example, hypoxic stress promotes the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) that impairs metabolic function and promotes expression of exhaustion-related genes including upregulation of inhibitory immune receptors.97 In IDH-mutant gliomas, 2-HG can enhance this metabolic and epigenetic dysfunction to further promote exhaustion.66 Additionally, Tregs and TAMs can bind to tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or secrete factors such as IL-10 and TGF-β that promote signaling pathways that enhance T-cell exhaustion.97 In addition to the classic immune checkpoints, PD-1 and CTLA-4, additional immune checkpoints have been characterized including T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM-3), which mediates immune suppression by binding to galectin 9 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEACAM).98 TIM-3 expression correlates with higher grade gliomas and lower Karnofsky Performance Status scores.98 Infiltrating lymphocytes in GBM co-expressing PD-1, TIM-3 and other checkpoint molecules have been shown to be non-functional.99 Several clinical trials are now underway investigating inhibitors of these immune checkpoints in conjunction with PD-1 inhibitors.100 Interestingly, recent studies using single-cell RNA and epitope sequencing analyses have shown that the majority of T cells in GBM tumors do not exhibit canonical exhaustion markers but rather are in a transitional state with enrichment of GZMKT cells.101 Further investigation is needed to understand how these T cells may differ from canonically exhausted T cells and the effects of GZMK expression on T-cell function and immune therapy response. | Experiments in patient-derived glioma cultures and xenograft models have shown that the MES signature is lost on explantation from the TME, suggesting that TME factors are necessary for the acquisition and maintenance of an MES phenotypic state.107 TAMs, which are increasingly recruited to the TME as the tumor progresses, have been shown to strongly associate with the development of MES state.2023108 These TAMs express proinflammatory (eg, TNF-), anti-inflammatory (eg, TGF-β), and pro-angiogenic (eg, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) factors, which have been shown to contribute to the MES transition through activation of the NF-kB pathway, leading to the upregulation of master transcription factors, including STAT3, CCAATenhancer binding protein beta (CEBPB), and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) that are implicated in mesenchymal reprogramming.107 Oncostatin-M secreted by TAMs has also been shown to induce the transition to an MES-like state in glioma cells.108 Oncostatin interacts with receptors on GBM cells that subsequently activates STAT3, a key transcription factor that initiates the MES program. | Interestingly, comparing GBM patients with short-term (6 months of progression-free survival) versus late-term (12 months) relapses following RT-TMZ treatment found short-term relapse patients have higher infiltration of alternatively-activated, pro-tumor M2-like macrophages.20 M2-like macrophages have been implicated in mediating RT resistance,119 which suggests that macrophage inhibitory therapy79 can be beneficial for short-term relapse patients. | Table 1

11625074.xml,Neuroprotective Potential of Aminonaphthoquinone Derivatives Against Amyloid Beta-Induced Neuronal Cell Death Through Modulation of SIRT1 and BACE1,"This study explores the neuroprotective potentials of ANQ derivatives (118) using in vitro models of AD pathology (i.e., Aβ42-induced SH-SY5Y cells). | Findings demonstrated that all compounds mitigated Aβ42-induced cellular damage by preserving cell viability and morphology. | Among all, four compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) showed potent antioxidant activities as well as abilities to minimize AD-related damages (i.e. decreasing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, preserving mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), protecting membrane damage, and modulating beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) activity) with comparable protective effects to the well-known neuroprotectant, resveratrol (RSV). | A molecular docking study indicated these compounds could suitably bind to sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) protein with preferable affinity. | Target prediction identified a list of possible AD-related targets of these compounds offering insights into their mechanisms of action and suggesting their multifunctional potentials. | Recently, the potential of low-dose BACE1 inhibitors was revealed to lower the levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 by 30, preventing the initial amyloidogenic cleavage and avoiding side effects . | Consequently, there is a renewed emphasis on developing more selective but less toxic BACE1 inhibitors used in pre-symptomatic stages in patients with AD. | But BACE1 inhibitor still showed potential as an AD therapeutic agent. | Combining with other pharmacological actions could lead to the development of effective neuroprotective agents for preventing AD progression. | NQs are well-known for their redox properties, this unique property makes them valuable templates for the discovery of numerous therapeutic agents (i.e., antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective agents). | The existing literature highlights several studies indicating that certain NQ derivatives exhibit neuroprotective effects, particularly in the context of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, key factors involved in the pathogenesis of AD . | SIRT1 is also considered a crucial player in neuroprotection due to its ability to enhance neuronal survival and functions . | Computational tools have emerged as pivotal strategies to expedite the identification of potential target proteins for novel compounds. | Molecular docking is commonly used to reveal possible binding modes and interactions of the compounds against the target , which would be beneficial for future design and optimization of the compounds. | Poor pharmacokinetics (drug-likeness) and severe toxicities of the compounds are key factors rendering the failures in drug development, especially the late-stage occurring ones. | Some compounds elicited promising anticancer activities, while most of them displayed low cytotoxicity or non-cytotoxicity to normal cell lines. | Additionally, various NQ derivatives have been shown to possess neuroprotective effects and SIRT1 activators . | Herein, these compounds were investigated for their neuroprotective effects against Aβ-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. | Furthermore, computational studies, (i.e., molecular docking, assessment of pharmacokinetics, and target prediction) were performed to uncover possible binding modes, drug-likeness of the compounds, and potential biological targets. | Investigated compounds (118) were individually dissolved in DMSO to generate concentrated stock solutions. | RSV was employed as a positive control due to its established neuroprotection and SIRT1 activator, as documented in previous literature . | Treatment regimens differed amongst groups including (i) the control group remained unexposed to ANQs (118) or Aβ42, (ii) the toxin-induced group was exposed to 1 µM Aβ42, (iii) the compound-treated group received treatment with ANQs (118) at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 µM for 24 h, (IV) the compound-pretreated group received pretreatment with ANQs (118) at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 µM for 3 h, followed by media refreshment and exposure to 1 µM Aβ42 for an additional 24 h. | In brief, either compounds at a concentration of 1 µM or cell lysate after treatment regimen were incubated with 590 mM H2O2 in 0.05 M PBS at pH 7.0 for 30 min. | Following the treatment, cell lysis was carried out in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA buffer) supplemented with protease inhibitors at 4 C for 20 min. | Cells were lysed in cold PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors at 4 C for 20 min following post-treatment. | The grid box center was positioned at -23.315, 65.890, and 14.723 to encompass the entire activator-binding site between the C-terminal and N-terminal domains of SIRT1. | Rotational bonds were defined as rigid for the protein, but flexible for the investigated compounds. | In Silico Assessment of Pharmacokinetics and Drug-Like Properties To evaluate the drug-likeness and potential toxicities of the investigated compounds, chemical structures in SMILES format were employed for the prediction using the web server tools, including SwissADME (http:www.swissadme.ch) , pkCSM (http:biosig.unimelb.edu.aupkcsm) , and ProTox-II (http:tox-new.charite.deprotox_II) . | Target Prediction For the prediction of AD-related gene targets pertaining to our investigated compounds, AD-related genes were sourced from two prominent databases, including DisGeNET with a score cutoff of 0.2 and GeneCards with a score threshold of 2.57, calculated through median determination. | Subsequently, the possible protein targets of the investigated compounds were predicted using two well-established web-based servers including SuperPred and SwissTargetPrediction . | The shared common targets were visualized as an intersected area using the VENNY 2.1 online tool (https:bioinfogp.cnb.csic.estoolsvenny) to identify a refined set of potential AD-associated targets specifically interacting with our compounds. | This intersection represents a focused list of the target proteins with a high likelihood of being involved in AD as well as a high potential to interact with the studied compounds. | These compounds possess a 1,4-NQ core structure with 2-amino or 2-amino-3-halo substituents, in which the 2-amino was substituted by phenyl ring bearing R (electron withdrawingelectron donating groups) substituents on 3- or 4-position. | SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated with various concentrations of compounds (0.1100 µM) for 24 h in the absence of Aβ42. | The results indicated that all compounds exhibited no significant effect on cell viability at minimal doses (0.11 µM). | However, some compounds demonstrated toxicity to the cells at higher concentrations (5100 µM). | The neuroprotective potential of ANQ derivatives was explored by pretreating the SH-SY5Y cells with each compound for 3 h before exposure to 1 µM Aβ42 for an additional 24 h. | Results demonstrated that 1 µM compounds significantly enhanced cell viability of the pretreated cells, specifically compound 10 (93.38 1.69), compound 12 (88.66 1.54), compound 16 (87.38 2.32), and compound 18 (88.80 2.12), compared to the cells treated with Aβ42 alone (Fig. | Notably, these compounds elicited protective effects comparable to that of the RSV, a reference compound known for its cell viability protection (87.20 1.13). | Based on the results, these four ANQs (10, 12, 16, and 18) at a concentration of 1 µM were selected for further explorations to elucidate potential neuroprotective mechanisms. | Scale bar 200 μm ANQs Did Not Alter Cellular Morphology Bright-field microscopy revealed the protective effects of the selected compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) against Aβ42-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. | Particularly, the co-incubation of H2O2 with these compounds significantly decreased the reduction rate of KMnO4 by 70 compared to that of the H2O2 alone (Fig. | Furthermore, the antioxidant effect of these compounds on the induction of catalase-like activity was investigated in cell lysates following the designated treatments. | Interestingly, pretreatment with the tested compounds significantly increased catalase-like activity compared to the cells solely exposed to 1 µM Aβ42 for 24 h, as observed in the decreased H2O2 concentration after incubating with the cell lysate (Fig. | (A) Percentage of H2O2 reductance from selected compounds (1 µM). | P 0.05 compared to the control cells; P 0.05 compared to the Aβ42 group ANQs Diminished Intracellular ROS Generation Against Aβ42-Treated Cells The effect of selected compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) on intracellular ROS generation was evaluated using the DCFDA fluorescent probe. | Conversely, pretreatment with 1 µM of compounds 10, 12, 16, 18, or RSV for 3 h prior to Aβ42 exposure significantly reduced ROS accumulation. | This was evident by a decrease in DCFDA fluorescence intensity compared to the control group (compounds 10: 109.70 0.74, 12: 109.54 0.95, 16: 111.16 0.97, 18: 106.87 1.13, and RSV: 109.22 1.65). | MMP Maintained by ANQs Pretreatment The protective potential of selected compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) against mitochondrial dysfunction was investigated by assessing the fluorescent signal emitted from the rhodamine-123 dye. | Nevertheless, pretreatment with 1 µM of compounds 10, 12, 16, 18, or RSV significantly preserved the MMP by 95.24 2.32, 94.05 1.20, 94.41 1.77, 93.52 2.01, and 94.94 1.09, respectively, compared to the control group. | This suggested the remarkable ability of the compounds to safeguard the mitochondrial function from Aβ42-mediated neurotoxicity. | Importantly, pretreatment with 1 µM of tested compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) or RSV significantly counteracted this Aβ42-induced LDH release as observed by the reduction in LDH release to near-control levels (compounds 10: 106.24 1.66, 12: 106.36 1.29, 16: 108.44 1.89, 18: 106.73 1.62, and RSV: 103.35 1.95). | The results showed the membrane-protective properties of these ANQs, which could potentially contribute to their neuroprotective abilities. | Interestingly, the compounds showed comparable effects with those observed for RSV, which maintained BACE1 activity at 111.67 8.16. | The compounds showed similar effects with those observed for RSV, a well-known SIRT1 activator, which exhibited sustained SIRT1 activity up to 88.32 3.23. | P 0.05 compared to the control; P 0.05 compared to the Aβ42 group Binding Interaction of ANQs in SIRT1 Molecular docking was conducted to elucidate potential binding modes of the selected compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) toward the target protein, SIRT1 (PDB code 5BTR). | This protein structure was selected due to its sufficient resolution and the co-crystallized RSV, a well-known SIRT1 activator, which was used as a reference compound for validation of docking protocol to provide reliable details and binding characteristics necessary for accurate molecular docking. | Subsequently, the validated protocol was utilized to explore the binding modes of the studied compounds. | Docking simulations of the studied compounds showed that all investigated compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) could suitably bind within the same activator-binding site of SIRT1 in similar manners to those of RSVs, Fig. | However, docking algorithms often favor larger compounds because they can form more atomic interactions within the binding site, leading to molecular weight bias in the docking scores. | Since our compounds are larger than RSV, this bias could result in an overemphasis on their binding affinities. | To address this, we evaluated additional factors such as interacted amino acid and type of interactions to ensure that the observed binding affinities are not solely a result of molecular size but reflect interactions between the compounds and SIRT1. | Among three RSV molecules, RSV2 served as a reference model due to its lowest binding free energy among others and its close spatial proximity to the studied compounds. | The studied compounds were found to share some key interacting amino acid residues with RSV2 (i.e., ILE223 and ASN226). | Notably, the NQ core skeleton and the substituted phenyl ring presented in the compounds could mimic the two phenyl rings of the RSV by playing parts in the formations of pi-alkyl and pi-sigma interactions. | However, conventional hydrogen bonding with THR209 residue observed in the binding of RSV was not observed in any studied compounds. | 7Possible binding modes and ligand-protein interactions of the selected

pharmacokinetics of the selected compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) was conducted employing three established web-based tools (i.e., SwissADME, pkCSM, and ProTox-II) as provided in Table 1. | The results indicated that all compounds are drug-like molecules, as shown by the criteria of Lipinskis, Vebers, and Ghoses rules. | The compounds exhibited favorable water solubility, optimal lipophilicity (log P 5), as well as high intestinal absorption (91.9294.58) for oral administration. | Additionally, these compounds provided moderate drug distribution potential (human VDss of 0.150.23 log Lkg) as well as moderate CNS and BBB permeabilities, which suggested their abilities to reach the target site in the CNS. | For metabolic considerations, all compounds were identified as substrates of CYP3A4, a major cytochrome P450 enzyme responsible for metabolizing over 90 of available drugs. | Furthermore, they were predicted as inhibitors of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, or CYP2C9, which implicated an alternative metabolic fate and potential drug-drug interactions. | In terms of drug elimination and toxicity predictions, the studied compounds were predicted to exhibit total clearance ranging from 0.018 to 0.186 log mLminkg. | All of them, except for compound 12, were also identified as substrates of the renal OCT2. | Regarding toxicity, all compounds were classified as moderately hazardous with potential for hepatotoxicity, carcinogenicity, immunogenicity, and mutagenicity. | Table 1Predictions of physicochemical characteristics, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity profiles of the selected

series of 18 ANQ derivatives (118) was comprehensively investigated for neuroprotective potentials to reveal their multifaceted effects in combating Aβ42-induced cellular damage in SH-SY5Y cells. | Cell viability indicated that the tested compounds elicited a dose-dependent effect on neuronal cell survival. | All compounds are non-cytotoxic at low concentrations (0.11 µM), but some of them showed toxicity at higher concentrations (5100 µM). | It was shown that pretreatment with 1 µM of compounds (118) enhanced cell viability of the Aβ42-induced cells. | However, only four compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) demonstrated promising protective effects comparable to that of the RSV (Fig. | The selected compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) effectively protected the cells against Aβ42-induced cellular and membrane damages as shown by preserved normal cellular morphology (Fig. | These findings suggested the potential of compounds in stabilizing the cell membranes, preventing membrane leakage, and preserving cellular integrity. | Furthermore, the compounds effectively protected against Aβ42-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction as demonstrated by preserved MMP, a key indicator of mitochondrial health and function (Fig. | This protective property suggested that the compounds may prevent energetic deficits and maintain crucial cellular processes required for neuronal survival. | The selected compounds demonstrated abilities to counteract the Aβ42-induced oxidative stress as shown by their potent antioxidant capacities and abilities to diminish intracellular ROS levels (Fig. | Additionally, these compounds not only directly scavenge the ROS, but also significantly enhance cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms by increasing catalase-like activity (Fig. | This dual antioxidant action suggested their promising potentials as disease-modifying neuroprotective agents. | In view of chemical structure and activity relationship (SAR) of the compounds, notable differences between active and inactive compounds were observed. | As observed for compounds 4 and 10, and compounds 1 and 12, which have the same electron withdrawing groups but different positions of NO2 and COCH3, respectively. | Only compounds 10 and 12 demonstrated neuroprotective effects. | This could be due to such property of functional groups at meta-position may be required for appropriate interaction with the site of neuroprotective action. | These observations emphasize that types and substitution patterns of R substituents can significantly impact biological activity, guiding further structural optimization to enhance neuroprotective properties. | In-depth neuroprotective mechanisms of these compounds were demonstrated by their modulating effects on BACE1 and SIRT1 activities. | BACE1 activity is normally found to increase in AD conditions, however, pretreatment with the selected compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) showed an effective decrease of BACE1 activity in the Aβ42-induced cells (Fig. | SIRT1 is well-known to play roles in neuroprotection via modulating several key neurodegeneration-related pathways such as decreasing the generation and aggregation of misfolded proteins (Aβ) and inhibiting the transcription of the BACE1 gene, resulting in a decline in BACE1 activity . | Particularly, the selected compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) promisingly preserved SIRT1 activity with comparable potency to that of the RSV, the known SIRT1 activator (Fig. | This was supported by a molecular docking study which indicated that these compounds could suitably bind within the activator-binding site of the SIRT1 target in a similar manner with RSV as demonstrated by shared key interacting amino acid residues (i.e., ILE223 and ASN226). | The bindings of these compounds were dominated by pi-interactions formed between the NQ core or substituted phenyl ring of the compounds and SIRT1. | Additionally, these compounds showed superior binding affinity towards the SIRT1 as indicated by their lower binding free energy values (compounds from 10.47 to 9.34 kcalmol and RSV 7.51 kcalmol) (Fig. | Therefore, in silico analysis was used to predict various potential targets associated with our investigated compounds, aiming to identify broader neuroprotective mechanisms, which were highlighted in a list of the top 20 potential AD-associated target proteins (Table 2). | Accordingly, investigated compounds may be able to modulate the Aβ-induced neuroinflammatory response by targeting Src family kinases . | This suggested that our compounds could be further developed for modulating pro-inflammatory cascades to combat neuroinflammation. | This finding together with our in vitro results potentially suggested a unifying mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effects of the studied ANQs through the downstream targets of SIRT1. | Taken together, the findings highlighted that the ANQs are promising compounds to be further developed as multifunctional neuroprotective agents to combat the multifaceted pathogenesis of AD. | In silico predictions demonstrated that all four compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) are drug-like compounds with favorable pharmacokinetics for potential oral administration (Table 1). | However, all compounds are CYP3A4 substrates and some of them are inhibitors of other CYPs. This raised the concerning issue regarding their drug-drug or food-drug interaction potentials and further investigations are recommended. | Although these compounds were predicted as moderately hazardous, it is suggested that in vitro and in vivo studies on hepatotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and other toxic issues should be further investigated. | Conclusion A series of 18 ANQ derivatives were comprehensively investigated for their neuroprotective potentials against AD in the Aβ42-induced SH-SY5Y cells. | Among all tested compounds, four compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) at 1 µM were selected for further experiments due to their promising protective effects comparable to that of the RSV (84.61). | The structural features of these compounds are NQs with 2-aminophenyl containing R substituents (3-NO2, 3-COCH3, and 4-CH3)-3-chloro groups as noted for compounds 10, 12, 16, and R 4-OCH3 for compound 18. | Furthermore, the compounds effectively modulated BACE1 and SIRT1 activities, which highlighted the potential for the reduction of Aβ42 accumulation and other key harmful events. | This was supported by the molecular docking study, which showed that these compounds (10, 12, 16, and 18) are potential SIRT1 activators. | Target prediction indicated a top-ranked list of possible AD-related targets of these compounds, which demonstrated their potentials for combating the complexing of the disease in multiple facets (i.e., neuroinflammation, neuronal cell death, and misfolded proteins) under the SIRT1 regulation. | Additionally, predictions of pharmacokinetics and toxicity profiles suggested that these compounds are drug-like molecules with CNS-penetrating ability as well as good intestinal absorption. | Taken together, these ANQ compounds are promising candidates for further development as oral disease-modifying agents for the management of AD.","Alzheimers (MISC), AD (MISC), A (MISC), C (LOC), AN (MISC), AN (MISC), AD (MISC), A (MISC), A (MISC), AD (MISC), 1 (MISC), AD (MISC), AN (MISC), AD (MISC), AD (MISC), AD (MISC)"

provides a more comprehensive reference for the inhibitory proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of baicalein on OSCC cells through Sp1 (Gao Z et al., 2020). | Besides, baicalein induced S-phase arrest and apoptosis in tongue squamous cell carcinoma CAL27 cells through dose-dependent upregulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and downregulation of MMP, which could be reversed by ROS inhibitors, suggesting a role for activation of mitochondrial oxidative stress pathway (Shi NX et al., 2023). | Consistent with this, baicalein induced autophagy and apoptosis in CAL27 cells through dose-dependent upregulation of ROS, Bax, cleaved PARP and downregulation of Bcl-2, which could be reversed by the ROS inhibitor NAC as well. | (2023c) found that baicalein dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation and invasion of laryngeal carcinoma AMC-N-8 cells, inducing apoptosis by inhibiting interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) thereby activating pro-apoptosis-related proteins Cyto-c, Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and inhibiting apoptosis inhibitory protein Bcl-2 in laryngeal cancer cells. | Then, miR-125b-5p inhibitor reversed the inhibitory effect of baicalein, which confirmed the target (Wang et al., 2023a). | The autophagy inhibitor 3-MA partially deregulated the inhibitory effect, confirming that baicalein inhibits laryngeal cancer development via autophagy in the miR-499aHDAC1 axis (Wang J et al., 2023b). | Flow cytometry and transwell indicate that treatment in mice showed that baicalin exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the viability, proliferation and invasion of tongue cancer cells CAL27 accompanied by a reduction in the expression of Notch and JAG1 proteins as well as suppressed EMT, not accompanied by significant toxicity to normal human oral epithelial cells HOEC by MTT assay. | In contrast, the NotchJAG1 pathway activator VPA was able to reverse the above effects, confirming that baicalin exerts its antitumor effects through inhibition of the NotchJAG1 pathway (Wang et al., 2023a). | 4.1.3 Wogonin Previous studies reported a direct inhibitory effect of wogonin concentration- and time-dependent on the proliferation of HN-6 cells, which was associated with cell arrest in the G0G1 phase and apoptosis (Dong WX et al., 2017). | Currently, the inhibitory effect of several flavonoids from S. | 4.2.2 Baicalin Time- and dose-dependent inhibition of ECA109 cell proliferation induced by baicalin is accompanied by upregulation of Bad, one of the major pro-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family, and downregulation of cIAP1, an apoptosis inhibitory protein belonging to the mitochondrial pathway in apoptosis, implying that baicalin can inhibit EC development through enhancing apoptosis (Liu SS et al., 2019). | While the p38 inhibitor SB203580 and activator chemical anisomycin were able to enhance and attenuate this anticancer effect, respectively, demonstrating that baicalein inhibits GC cell invasion and metastasis through the p38 signaling pathway (Yan X et al., 2015). | Silencing this protein partially reversed the inhibitory effect of baicalein, suggesting that GRP109A is one of the targets of baicalein to inhibit the proliferation of GC (Hua et al., 2020). | Further treatment experiment by ERS blocker 4-PBA and PI3K inhibitor LY294002 reversely demonstrated that baicalein triggered ERS-induced apoptosis by blocking the PI3KAKT pathway through activation of BTG3. | In addition to direct inhibitory effects, baicalein also enhances the effects of chemotherapeutic drugs at multiple targets. | Baicalein was able to concentration-dependently increase the inhibitory effect of oxaliplatin on the proliferation of SGC-7901 cells and induce apoptosis (Yang CL, 2016). | MMPs disrupt the histological barrier to accelerate tumor cell migration and, together with their inhibitors TIMPs, play a key role in tumor invasion and metastasis (Dibdiakova K et al., 2024). | Baicalin time- and concentration-dependently inhibited the activity of SGC-7901 cells without affecting normal cells GES-1, which could not be alleviated by apoptosis inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK and necrosis inhibitor Necrostatin-1. | The above effects were attenuated by the addition of Fer-1, an ferroptosis inhibitor. | It was found that baicalin upregulated LDH, GSDMD-N, IL-18, IL-1β, Caspase-1, NF-κB, IKKB, ROS, enhanced AGS cell pyrokinesis and dose-dependently reversed the effect of NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 Sodium, suggesting the involvement of the NF-BNLRP3 pathway (Liu J. | In addition, baicalin was able to concentration-dependently synergize with 5-FU to inhibit the growth, migration, and invasion of AGS and SGC-7901 cells accompanied by an increase in TFR1, NOX1, COX2, and ROS and a decrease in FTH1, FTL, and GPX4, which was reversed by the ferroptosis inhibitor Fer-1. | In addition, wogonin also potentiated the tumor inhibitory effect of oxaliplatin in a novel zebrafish model in vivo. | Baicalein dose-dependently decreased the viability of HT-29, HCT-116, SW480, and SW620 cells, which could be enhanced by the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ). | In addition, baicalein has been proved to dose-dependently potentiate the inhibitory effect of irinotecan on proliferation of HT-29 cells accompanied by the inhibitory effect of Yes-related protein (YAP), large-tumor suppressor kinase 1 (LATS1), and phosphorylation of Src, which plays an important role as a non-receptor protein complex kinase in EMT of CRC (Meng XC et al., 2022; Sadri F et al., 2023). | Further experiment revealed that wogonin had a time- and concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on the proliferation of HT29 and SW620 cells, which was accompanied by increased levels of apoptosis, EMT inhibition and decreased BLVRA expression (Mao HY et al., 2021). | Transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) is an important target of the Hippo pathway and contributes to CRC angiogenesis (Shen Y. | Currently, its treatment mainly includes multiple kinase inhibitors (MKIs), such as sorafenib and regorafenib, ablation, surgery and immunotherapy (Chen W et al., 2024). | It was found that Scutellaria Barbata extract dose-dependently inhibited the growth of SMMC-7721, HepG2, and Huh7 cells compared to the blank control group, which was accompanied by a decrease in the ferroptosis inducers GPX4 and SLC7A11 proteins, and a decrease in the ferroptosis inhibitors IREB2 and ACSL4 proteins. | In addition, animal experiments also demonstrated the inhibitory effect of S. | It was demonstrated that baicalein synergized with the PI3K pathway inhibitor LY294002 to inhibit the proliferation of SMMC-7721 cells without affecting apoptosis, a process that was associated with reduced expression of P-ERK12, CyclinD1, P-GSK-3β, and P-AKT (Wang et al., 2017a). | NF-κB interacting LncRNA (NKILA), an important regulator in tumor development, was found to be downregulated in SMMC-7721, Hep3B, HCCLM3, and HepG2 cells compared to normal hepatocytes and interacted closely with baicalein: overexpression of NKILA increased the expression of the inhibitory effects of baicalein on the proliferation and migration of SMMC-7721 and HepG2 and its knockdown reversed these effects, which was also verified in animal experiments (10 mgkgd 28 d). | Further studies revealed that NKILA enhances the inhibitory effect of baicalein on NF-κB transcriptional activity, and the NF-κB inhibitor JSH-23 disrupts this synergy, implying that the combination of these is a promising therapeutic strategy (Yu X et al., 2018). | Furthermore, baicalein has been shown to synergize with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 to induce G0G1 phase arrest and apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells (He K et al., 2018). | Baicalin was able to inhibit proliferation of HepG2 cells alone or in concert with the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib and the MET inhibitor crizotinib, triggering G1-phase cell arrest and induction of apoptosis accompanied by a decrease in p-MET, p-EGFR protein expression (Hu ZP et al., 2023). | Following experiment revealed that NAG-1 knockdown eliminated the inhibitory effect of oroxylin-A on TGF-βpathway in SMMC-7721 cells, suggesting that oroxylin-A knockdown NAG-1 by upregulating it. | Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9), a transcriptional activator belonging to the CDK family, whose

normal cells LO2, and the CDK9 inhibitors LDC067 and PHA767491 inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 in vitro and in vivo, respectively. | Moreover, oroxylin-A (300 mgkgd 2w) also enhanced the antitumor effects of PD-1PD-L1 inhibitors in mice. | Meanwhile, 75 molL baicalein and 20 molL had similar in vitro inhibitory effects (Ao P et al., 2018). | The concentration-dependent induction of S-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by baicalein was accompanied by an increase in p21 levels and a decrease in CCND1 levels, having an inhibitory effect on the proliferation, motility, and invasion of PANC-1 cells, which was identified in the animal experiments. | Baicalein dose- and time-dependently inhibited the proliferation and migration of BxPC-3 and PANC-1 cells, and induced G0G1 phase arrest, which was consistent with the effects of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and the MEK inhibitor PD98059. | 4.6.3 Wogonin Wogonin time- and dose-dependently induced PANC-1 and AsPC-1 Cell

and neuronal survival . | The Janus kinase (JAK)signal transducer and transcriptional activator 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. | In an animal model with systemic inflammation, the administration of a STAT3 inhibitor not only protects against microglial activation and neuroinflammation, characteristic of AD pathophysiology, but also reduces beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) protein levels . | Additionally, the loss of STAT3 in reactive astrocytes and systemic treatment with a STAT3 inhibitor contribute to the restoration of cerebral network function, providing protection against spatial memory and learning impairments and improving cognitive decline . | Treatment with a specific STAT3 inhibitor has demonstrated a reduction in neuroinflammatory plaques, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation in experimental animal models of AD, leading to improved cognitive function and a protective effect on neurovascular function . | Therefore, further research is needed to explore the potential therapeutic use of STAT3 inhibitors in AD. | This study investigates the neuroprotective potential of STAT3 inhibition in reducing oxidative stress-induced neuronal damage and apoptosis, key drivers in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases like AD. | Our findings demonstrate that STAT3 inhibitors effectively mitigate oxidative damage and apoptosis by activating CREB via the ERK signaling pathway, a crucial mechanism for reducing cell death. | Blocking this pathway with an ERK inhibitor abolished the protective effects of STAT3 inhibition, underscoring the central role of the ERKCREB signaling pathway. | STAT3 inhibitors, including Stattic purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, AG490, and Nifuroxazide obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX, USA), and ODZ10117, a novel STAT3 inhibitor synthesized in-house by our research group . | After treatment with the STAT3 inhibitor, the Cytotox Dye-containing medium was added to achieve a final concentration of 250 nM, simultaneous with H2O2 treatment. | Thus, this study aimed to investigate whether a STAT3 inhibitor exerts protective effects against cell damage and death induced by H2O2 exposure. | To inhibit STAT3, we utilized a small-molecule inhibitor targeting STAT3 activation. | This included the JAK2 inhibitors AG490 and Nifuroxazide, along with STAT3 selective inhibitors such as Stattic and ODZ10117. | First, we examined whether the STAT3 inhibitor had a protective effect against the increased cell apoptosis induced by H2O2. | SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated with the STAT3 inhibitor for 12 h, followed by exposure to H2O2 for an additional 12 or 24 h. | However, cells pretreated with the STAT3 inhibitor before H2O2 exposure exhibited increased cell survival rates (Fig. | However, these morphological changes were significantly inhibited by treatment with STAT3 inhibitor. | Pretreatment with STAT3 inhibitor substantially alleviated H2O2-induced cell damage, resulting in a more stable cell appearance (Fig. | Furthermore, H2O2 treatment increased cell toxicity, but the STAT3 inhibitor treatment considerably reduced this increase in cell toxicity (Fig. | This indicates that the STAT3 inhibitor protects cells from cell damage caused by H2O2, thereby increasing cell survival rates. | To validate the protective effects of the STAT3 inhibitor against oxidative stress, intracellular ROS levels were measured using CellROX Green Reagent as an indicator of oxidative damage. | However, pretreatment with the STAT3 inhibitor significantly reduced ROS levels, indicating that the inhibitor effectively mitigates oxidative stress (Fig. | Collectively, these findings suggest that STAT3 inhibition exerts neuroprotective effects by alleviating oxidative stress and promoting cell survival in neuronal cells.Fig. | 1STAT3 inhibitor alleviates H2O2-induced oxidative damage and enhances cell viability. | In response to H2O2 treatment, the proportion of Annexin V-positive cells increased, but the presence of the STAT3 inhibitor significantly reduced the apoptotic cell rate (Fig. | Additionally, H2O2 treatment increased caspase-dependent apoptosis, as indicated by a significant rise in caspase-3, caspase-9, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, which was alleviated by the STAT3 inhibitor treatment (Fig. | In summary, this study demonstrates that a STAT3 inhibitor exerts protective effects against H2O2-induced cell damage and apoptosis. | 2STAT3 inhibitor reduces H2O2-induced apoptosis and decreases caspase activation. | Treatment with STAT3 inhibitors elicits rapid phosphorylation of CREB, resulting in a noticeable increase in p-CREB within 3 h of treatment. | The observed changes in p-CREB levels in response to STAT3 inhibitors closely correspond to the suppression patterns of p-STAT3, demonstrating a coherent link between the inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation and subsequent regulation of CREB phosphorylation. | Initially, we examined the effects of STAT3 inhibitors on ERK and Akt phosphorylation. | Treatment with STAT3 inhibitors triggered the activation of ERK and Akt (Fig. | Consistent with the observed changes in p-CREB following STAT3 inhibitor treatment, the levels of p-ERK and p-Akt

MEKERK inhibitor PD98059 or the PI3KAkt inhibitor LY294002. | The phosphorylation of CREB induced by STAT3 inhibitors was significantly diminished in the presence of PD98059 (Fig. | In contrast, the co-treatment of STAT3 inhibitors and the Akt inhibitor led to a further enhancement in CREB phosphorylation compared to the group treated with STAT3 inhibitors alone (Fig. | Based on our confirmation that STAT3 inhibitors induce CREB activation through the ERK signaling pathway, we aimed to investigate whether STAT3 inhibition regulates the expression of ERKCREB-related IEGs in neuronal cells as a potential mechanism for ameliorating memory impairments. | We scrutinized the mRNA levels of c-Fos, c-Jun, Arc, Egr-1, NR4A1, and Homer1a to assess their modulation in response to STAT3 inhibitor

SH-SY5Y cells exposed to H2O2. | These protective effects are mediated through the regulation of the ERKCREB signaling pathway, providing valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying neuroprotection and laying the groundwork for therapies targeting neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. | Our results show that STAT3 inhibitors can reduce cell damage and death induced by H2O2. | STAT3 inhibitors alleviate morphological changes and cell toxicity associated with oxidative stress, demonstrating their neuroprotective capabilities. | These findings suggest that STAT3 inhibition effectively counters the detrimental effects of oxidative stress, making STAT3 inhibitors promising candidates for neuroprotection in conditions characterized by oxidative damage. | Phosphorylation of CREB, a transcription factor essential for neuronal survival and damage recovery, was significantly enhanced following STAT3 inhibitor treatment. | Our study corroborates this notion, showing that STAT3 inhibitors activate both ERK and Akt. | Remarkably, simultaneous treatment with STAT3 and Akt inhibitors synergistically enhanced CREB phosphorylation, with concurrent augmentation in ERK phosphorylation and more robust inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation compared to STAT3 treatment alone. | Previous studies have shown that enhancing CREB activity can improve cognitive deficits in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases , suggesting that STAT3 inhibitors might offer similar benefits. | The regulation of IEGs such as c-Fos, c-Jun, Arc, Egr-1, NR4A1, and Homer1a by STAT3 inhibitors underscores the potential cognitive benefits of targeting STAT3. | Previous studies have demonstrated that treatment with STAT3 inhibitors effectively improves cognitive impairment in animal models of AD . | Our research supports these findings by presenting new mechanisms that underline the dual role of STAT3 inhibitors in counteracting oxidative stress and enhancing cognitive functions impaired by neurodegenerative diseases. | Notably, the well-known anticancer properties of STAT3 inhibitors could effectively address challenges associated with CREB-focused strategies. | Firstly, our study heavily relied on in vitro experiments using small-molecule inhibitors. | Thoroughly elucidating the complex molecular mechanisms through which STAT3 inhibition activates the ERKCREB signaling pathway and exploring the broad applicability of STAT3 inhibitors in protecting neuronal cell health in various neurodegenerative contexts requires additional investigation. | Moreover, while our study focused on cell damage induced by H2O2, more research is needed to investigate the efficacy of STAT3 inhibitors in mitigating cell damage induced by other oxidative stress factors and explore potential benefits in various models of neurodegenerative diseases. | In summary, this study provides evidence that STAT3 inhibitors protect neuronal cells from oxidative stress-induced damage through the activation of the ERKCREB signaling pathway. | The enhancement of CREB phosphorylation and the upregulation of IEGs associated with synaptic plasticity and memory formation suggest that STAT3 inhibitors hold promise not only for mitigating cell death but also for supporting cognitive function in neurodegenerative diseases. | p 0.05, p 0.01, p 0.005 compared

Neurotrophic Factor Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) are a special family of proteins that play a role in the growth and differentiation of both mature and immature neurons, serving as fundamental NTFs influencing central nervous system (CNS) function. | In 1982, researchers extracted and purified a substance termed brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) from the pig brain, which was shown to affect the survival of the nerve root ganglia . | The functions of BDNF include the regulation of the development of neurons and glial cells, neuroprotection, and modulation of the short and longterm synaptic interactions crucial for cognition and memory . | These findings have sparked significant interest in the use of BDNF as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker of cancer as well as in the development of drugs that target TrkB and its downstream pathways, such as firstgeneration TrkB inhibitors . | Additionally, studies have shown that mBDNF can act as a dimer on the TrkB receptor, activating multiple signaling pathways, including the phosphatidylinositol 3kinase (PI3K)protein kinase B (Akt), NFκB, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways thereby regulating various biological activities of the nervous system, including neuronal survival, synaptic efficacyplasticity, spine growth, and maturation. | Thus, neurons can release mature BDNF as a primary neurotrophic signal or neuromodulator. | Additionally, compared to proBDNF, the effects of mBDNF primarily involve enhanced neuronal survival, growth, and synaptic activity . | BDNF activates TrkB, exerting neuroprotective effects by inducing neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity . | The PI3KAkt pathway regulates several proteins essential for neuronal survival. | This activation, in turn, activates cAMPresponse elementbinding protein (CREB), promoting neuronal survival . | Additionally, in Ishikawa cells, TrkB overexpression was shown to significantly increase the phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, whereas TrkB knockout terminated their phosphorylation . | BDNF activates TrkB, exerting neuroprotective effects by inducing neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. | The PI3KAkt pathway regulates several proteins essential for neuronal survival. | This activation, in turn, activates CREB, promoting neuronal survival. | However, BDNF has a neuroprotective effect and can alleviate pain in higher central structures, such as the hippocampus and cortex . | miR30a3p targets the Ecalciumbinding protein transcription activator (EP300), which upregulates BDNF at the epigenetic level by enhancing the acetylation of histones H3 and H4 in its promoter. | These activated glial cells may release the neurotrophic factor BDNF, leading to an increase in BDNF levels (PMID: 34877406). | BDNF and the PI3kAkt signaling pathway are involved in neuroregeneration and antiapoptotic activity. | Research has confirmed that the natural polyphenol curcumin can exert positive neuroprotective effects in PD by activating the BDNF and PI3kAkt signaling pathways . | In this context, BDNF may regulate the function of PSD protein and PSD95PSD97 complexes by binding to density proteins, contributing to their neuroprotective mechanisms . | Other approaches include the use of TrkB receptor ligands, smallmolecule BDNF mimetics, and functional antibodies , as well as compounds that enhance BDNF synthesis, delivery, and signal transduction, including natural products . | TrkB belongs to the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor (NTRK2)

11626785.xml,GABA and its receptors' mechanisms in the treatment of insomnia,"Finding a safer and more effective therapeutic drug has become an urgent need for current research.Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. | Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. | In addition, GABA can regulate macrophages and microglia, inhibit the activation of related inflammatory pathways such as the NF-κB signaling pathway and reduce the release of inflammatory factors, thus inhibiting neuroinflammation and playing a neuroprotective role . | 2 The link between the physiological role of GABA and insomnia 2.1 Physiological functions of GABA GABA is one of the major inhibitory neurotransmitters regulating sleep in the mammalian central nervous system, with hypnotic, sedative and anxiolytic functions. | Transmission of GLU and GABA in the CNS controls the neural excitatoryinhibitory balance to keep the brain in an optimal state for optimal function. | GABA is produced by the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) that catalyzes the decarboxylation of Glu, and the production of GABA produces an inhibitory effect on the excitatory properties of GLU in order to maintain the neural excitabilityinhibition balance . | In addition to this, many studies have found that GABA amelioration of insomnia may be associated with biological processes such as inhibition of nervous system inflammation, repair of oxidative damage, neuroprotection and melatonin regulation . | Activation of GABAARs allows chloride ions to enter the cell, leading to hyperpolarization of the neuron, which exerts an inhibitory effect on neurotransmission and relieves hyperexcitability . | In contrast, recent studies have found the presence of extrasynaptic GABAARs, which have a high affinity for GABA, can acutely sense changes in peripheral GABA levels, and mediate slower tone overall inhibitory effects . | This suggests that, in addition to exerting a rapid inhibitory effect, activation of GABAARs may also provide a sustained inhibitory effect to prevent excitatory neural overactivation. | When agonists bind to postsynaptic GABABRs, potassium efflux increases, producing a slow inhibitory potential that hyperpolarizes the membrane and generates an inhibitory postsynaptic potential that provides sustained inhibition (Fig. | Studies have shown that IL-1β and TNF-α expression is significantly enhanced and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression is attenuated in the brain tissue of chronic sleep-restricted rats , whereas in humans, acute sleep deprivation also enhances the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α . | Furthermore, in bacterial models, GABA deficiency loses its ability to block neurodegeneration, whereas in situ supplementation confers neuroprotective activity, suggesting that GABA plays a neuroprotective role in the host . | On the other hand, GABA receptor agonists are also neuroprotective against cerebral ischemic injury. | In a kainic acid (KA)-induced seizure model in rats, co-activation of GABA receptor agonists (felicitin and baclofen) achieves neuroprotection by attenuating the FasFasL apoptotic signaling pathway, inhibiting erythrocyanine-induced increase in thioredoxin reductase activity, inhibiting procaspase-3 activation, and decreasing caspase-3 cleavage . | 4.2 Mechanism of action of GABA in regulating brain immune cells Inhibition of neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and injurious autophagy and thus neuroprotection is an important idea in the treatment of insomnia. | Numerous studies have shown that GABA is involved in inhibiting the process of neuroinflammatory response , and in macrophages, microglia and astrocytes, GABA has been found to inhibit the release of inflammatory factors by affecting NF-κB signaling and thus exerting an inhibitory effect on neuroinflammation . | This process releases the inflammatory factor IL-1β, leading to neuroinflammation, which can be reversed by inhibitors related to inflammatory signaling pathways . | Melatonin inhibits sympathetic vasodilatory tone by potentiating GABAA receptor activity and inhibiting the activity of presympathetic neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), an inhibitory effect mediated by GABAA receptors . | For the short-term treatment of insomnia, benzodiazepines with moderate half-lives, such as temazepam and chlordiazepoxide, have better acceptability than short- or long-acting compounds . | 6 Research perspectives on GABA in insomnia GABA is an important inhibitory neurotransmitter that balances neural hyperexcitability during insomnia. | In addition, GABA has been found to inhibit neuronal damage by increasing the activation of Akt, GSK-3β and ERK, significantly reducing neuronal damage; maintain the redox state of neuronal cells through the regulation of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β and the antioxidant-related nuclear factor redox-related factor 2 (NRF2), which play a neuroprotective role. | The neuroprotective effects of GABA are closely related to the regulation of inflammation, autophagy, and redox reactions, but how do these three interconnections affect each other, and how does GABA link the three? | 7 Conclusion GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain and has an important balancing effect on neural hyperexcitability and neurological damage in insomnia. | The mechanisms of neuroprotective effects exerted by GABA in inhibiting neuroinflammation and repairing oxidative damage, as well as the association with melatonin, were elucidated. | In addition, more attention should be paid to the molecular mechanism of action of GABA in the future, such as to the key inhibitory inflammatory molecule NF-κB signaling, the corresponding mechanism of GABA and melatonin circadian rhythm, and the mechanism of action of GABAC receptor and GABAB receptor.","GA (MISC), Inso (MISC), Alzheimers (MISC), Parkinsons (MISC), E (MISC), GA (MISC), GABA (MISC), GABA (MISC), GA (MISC), GA (MISC), GA (MISC), GA (MISC), GA (MISC), United States (LOC)"

11627502.xml,Epigenetics-targeted drugs: current paradigms and future challenges,"Over the past two decades, a growing array of small molecule drugs targeting epigenetic enzymes such as DNA methyltransferase, histone deacetylase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and enhancer of zeste homolog 2, have been thoroughly investigated and implemented as therapeutic options, particularly in oncology. | These include inhibitors, agonists, degraders, and multitarget agents, aiming to identify practical challenges and promising avenues for future research. | For example, age-related hypermethylation within the promoter regions of tumor suppressor and metabolic genes may partially explain the increased susceptibility of the elderly to tumors and various metabolic disorders.46 Conversely, DNMT inhibitor decitabine can reverse hypermethylation in tumor suppressors, enhancing their expression and inducing a senescence-like phenotype in tumor cell lines.47 Other mechanisms, such as histone modifications and chromatin remodeling, are also strongly linked to aging. | The roles of histone methylation and acetylation in tumor progression have been extensively explored, with numerous reviews summarizing therapeutic strategies targeting these histone modifications or their associated epigenetic-modifying enzymes, underscoring their pathological significance and therapeutic potential.58,59 Noticeably, bromodomain (BD) and extra-terminal (BET) family member proteins, including BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT, serving as interpreters of histone acetylation modification, have recently been found to facilitate tumorigenesis when overexpressed.60,61 Upregulated BET proteins can function as oncogenic transcriptional factors in tissue cells, driving a unique transcriptional program and controlling cell phenotype.62,63 Therefore, potent inhibitors targeting BET proteins may be considered potential agents for tumor treatment. | The primary roles of epigenetic mechanisms in tumorigenesis and their further development are presented in the illustrator Epigenetics and metabolic syndrome and related disorders Metabolic syndrome encompasses a constellation of pathological conditions characterized by abnormal aggregation of metabolic components, notably abdominal obesity or overweight, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance andor glucose tolerance abnormalities, and hypertension.85 These metabolic dysfunctions significantly elevate the risk of developing diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and cardiovascular diseases.86 Epigenetic modifications play a crucial role in nutrient metabolism under physiological conditions and also bridge the genetic and environmental factors contributing to metabolic disorders.87 For instance, dietary patterns significantly influence epigenetic markers; studies have shown that a high-fat diet in mice leads to hypermethylation in the promoter regions of genes like Rac family small guanosine triphosphate hydrolase (GTPase) 1, which promotes the progression of diabetic retinopathy.88 Dietary-induced epigenetic changes can impact subsequent generations, increasing their risk of glucose intolerance and diabetes.89 Moreover, epigenetic alterations linked to diet are implicated in developing gout and NAFLD.90,91 Additionally, the activity of epigenetics-modifying enzymes and their cofactors, such as TET and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) from the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), can be influenced by abnormal metabolite levels in patients with metabolic diseases, further disrupting epigenetic regulation and exacerbating disease progression.92 Epigenetic markers, especially DNA methylation landscapes, also provide diagnostic tools;93 in T2DM, for example, differential methylation in genes such as thioredoxin interacting protein, adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette subfamily G member 1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-coactivator 1 alpha, and protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type N2, can elucidate pathophysiological mechanisms.94 Understanding these epigenetic mechanisms in metabolic diseases is thus pivotal for developing innovative prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies. | For instance, hypomethylation mediated by TET2 within the promoter region of absent in melanoma 2, a critical component of the inflammasome, influences T follicular helper cell-dependent humoral immune responses in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).103 Additionally, altered patterns of miRNA in serum exosomes and immune cells have been identified, promising potential as biomarkers for diagnosis and indicators of disease severity.104,105 Histone modifications also play a pivotal role in SLE, where the administration of HDAC inhibitors has been shown to reduce cytokine profiles and improve pathogenesis in SLE and other inflammatory conditions.106 Moreover, the therapeutic potential of BET proteins in antibody-mediated diseases (e.g., SLE) has recently been evaluated. | BET inhibitors alter the pro-inflammatory phenotypes of mononuclear phagocytes and impair the recruitment of dendritic cells in vitro.107 Beyond SLE, epigenetic mechanisms are implicated in the progression of other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis,108 autoimmune thyroid diseases,109 multiple sclerosis,110 T1DM,111 and severe aplastic anemia,112 highlighting the potential for epigenetics-modifying drugs in treatment strategies. | Altered DNA methylation patterns have been observed in brain and blood samples from individuals with PD.123,124 TET2 may play a critical pathogenic role in PD, where its inactivation has shown a neuroprotective effect on dopaminergic neurons.125 Histone acetylation dysregulation is extensively studied in PD, associated with the accumulation of phosphorylated α-synuclein and mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction.126,127 Dysregulation in ncRNAs, particularly long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and miRNAs affects the mRNA levels of pathogenic factors post-transcriptionally and is linked with clinical symptoms such as non-motor symptoms, cognitive deficits, and inflammation, presenting potential targets for PD treatment.128 In HD, epigenetic modification alterations are vital markers of its pathogenesis. | Studies have shown the positive effects of using DNMT inhibitors, HDAC inhibitors, and extracellular vesicles loaded with miRNAs in preventing mutant huntingtin-induced neurotoxicity, emphasizing the potential roles of epigenetic dysregulations in HD.129131 Recently, the impact of aberrant m6A RNA methylation on the progression of HD has been increasingly recognized. | These drugs are categorized into four main types based on their mechanisms: DNMT inhibitors, HDAC inhibitors, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) inhibitors, and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) inhibitors (Table 2).Table 1Key examples of epigenetics-modifying

hypomethylating agents (HMAs), target DNMT1 and were among the first epigenetics-targeted drugs approved for clinical use. | This cytidine deaminase enzyme inhibitor enhances decitabine exposure after oral administration. | With significant advances in optimizing HMA formulations and dosages, as well as the increasing number of combination therapies showing promising effects on solid tumors in vitro and in vivo, clinical trials of HMAs, particularly the oral formulations CC-486 and ASTX727, among patients with solid tumors, are being extensively conducted, and their results are eagerly anticipated.154156 HDAC inhibitors Over the past two decades, substantial progress has been made in developing HDAC inhibitors, with six approved for clinical use. | They are used to treat conditions such as multiple myeloma (MM), cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL).157,158 Additionally, chidamide (tucidinostat) was approved by PMDA in Japan and National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China for the treatment of PTCL and advanced breast cancer,159,160 and more recently, givinostat (ITF2357) was approved by the FDA in March 2024 as the first nonsteroidal treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) for patients aged six years and older.161 Vorinostat was the first pan-inhibitor of HDACs approved by the FDA in October 2006 for CTCL.162 Soon after, in July 2011, it was also approved for clinical therapy by PMDA. | While generally mild, adverse events related to vorinostat can include thrombosis, QT interval prolongation, and potentially fatal ventricular tachycardia or torsional tachycardia.167169 These findings have driven the development of other HDAC inhibitors, with the expectation of elevated safety and efficacy in vivo. | Romidepsin, another pan-HDAC inhibitor, was approved by the FDA in November 2009 for CTCL and later for PTCL. | Phase III randomized controlled trials are performed to evaluate the therapeutic value of the first-line treatment of PTCL, referring to the combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP), and romidepsin plus CHOP in patients with PTCL, while the addition of romidepsin failed to increase efficacy as expected.171,172 However, after a six-year follow-up, the application of romidepsin shows beneficial effects in prolonging median progression-free survival.171 In addition, the combination of romidepsin with other therapeutics, such as oral 5-azacytidine, tenalisib (an inhibitor of phosphoinositide-3-kinase and salt-inducible-kinase-3), and lenalidomide (a new generation of immune modulator) shows promising therapeutic potential in various types of T-cell lymphoma in the initial stages of clinical practice, supporting further exploration.173176 Meanwhile, investigations on the therapeutic effects of romidepsin against other diseases are ongoing, particularly in antiretroviral treatment in human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection.177,178 Belinostat was FDA-approved in July 2014 for relapsed or refractory (RR) PTCL, showing pan-inhibitory effects on HDAC proteins.179 Common adverse effects of belinostat include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysgeusia, fatigue, and severe hematologic treatment-related adverse events.180,181 Further, dosing considerations are needed for patients with hepatic impairment due to liver metabolism.182 Belinostat is being explored for other myeloid malignancies and solid tumors, including glioblastoma and small-cell lung cancer.183186 Panobinostat, an oral broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitor approved in January 2015 for RR MM in combination with dexamethasone and bortezomib, showed a slight overall survival benefit in phase II and III trials.187 However, many participants experienced adverse events like thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, asthenia, and fatigue, which raises concerns about its tolerability.187189 In a recent randomized phase II clinical trial, it was proposed that administering bortezomib via subcutaneous application rather than intravenous injection could improve the safety and tolerability of the triplet regimen, including panobinostat.190 Beyond its primary indications, panobinostat is being explored for its efficacy in various other tumor diseases such as lymphoma, primary myelofibrosis, glioma, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, and prostate cancer, both as monotherapy and in combination with other tumor therapeutics, showing promising efficacy across multiple malignancies.191195 However, the safety of panobinostat continues to be a primary concern and requires further evaluation in advanced clinical studies. | Chidamide, the first orally administered selective HDAC inhibitor targeting HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC10,160 is currently under investigation for a variety solid and hematological malignancies, autoimmune diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases.196201 It offers advantages over pan-inhibitors in the treatment of tumor diseases and in minimizing severe adverse effects.160 Recent therapeutic strategies using chidamide in combination with a second antitumor intervention have shown promising prospects. | For instance, a combination of chidamide and exemestane has proven effective as a neoadjuvant treatment for patients with stage II-III breast cancer that is hormone receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative.199,202 A recent phase III clinical trial reported an increased occurrence of grades 34 hematological adverse events in the tucidinostat plus exemestane group, while the median progression-free survival of these patients was notably improved.202 Furthermore, synergistic effects have been observed when chidamide is used in conjunction with immunotherapy, endocrine therapy, or chemoradiation, offering novel adjuvant approaches for tumor therapy.203206 Givinostat, developed by Italfarmaco SpA, is a potent inhibitor of HDAC1 and HDAC3 recently approved for clinical use. | In a pivotal, multicenter, randomized phase III clinical trial involving 179 patients with DMD aged at least six years, givinostat effectively delayed disease progression.207 The most common adverse events reported were diarrhea and vomiting.207 Additionally, givinostat shows promise as a treatment for polycythemia vera, particularly in patients unresponsive to hydroxycarbamide monotherapy.208 In phase III clinical trials, givinostat demonstrated promising efficacy and tolerability in patients with polycythemia vera.209,210 Subsequently, long-term follow-up over four years has further substantiated the therapeutic benefits and safety profile of givinostat.211 Throughout the follow-up period, the overall response rate consistently exceeded 80 among patients with PV, while only 10 of these patients experienced grade 3 treatment-related adverse events, suggesting its potential for prolonged clinical use.211 IDH inhibitors IDH is a key enzyme in the TCA cycle that normally catalyzes the conversion of isocitrate to α-KG and carbon dioxide. | In cells with mutated IDH, this enzyme instead produces 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), a metabolite that inhibits α-KG-dependent epigenetic enzymes and contributes to the aberrant epigenetic landscape seen in various diseases, particularly tumors.212,213 Currently, three IDH inhibitors are approved for clinical use: enasidenib (AG-221), ivosidenib (AG-120), and olutasidenib (FT-2102), targeting different forms of the enzyme mutation.214217 Additional IDH12 inhibitors that are allowed to be investigated in clinical practice include the dual inhibitor of mutant IDH12 vorasidenib (AG-881),218 the irreversible mutant IDH1 inhibitor LY3410738 (NCT06181045, NCT06181084), and the pan-mutant-IDH1 inhibitor BAY1436032.219,220 Enasidenib is an allosteric inhibitor targeting mutated IDH2, approved by the FDA in August 2017 for the treatment of RR AML with IDH2 mutations.221 Based on preliminary animal experiments and preclinical evidence, enasidinib effectively reduces the 2-HG levels derived from IDH2 mutations, reversing excessive histone and DNA methylation landscapes.222224 Subsequently, enasidinib has entered clinical trials and demonstrated good efficacy in treating AML and MDS patients, which is further considered a promising option for elderly AML patients over 60 years old, especially those who are not suitable for intensified chemotherapy.225230 Combination therapy with enasidenib and azacitidine has shown acceptable tolerability and potential to improve outcomes for patients with IDH-mutated AML.229,231,232 However, potential severe adverse effects include hyperbilirubinemia, thrombocytopenia, pneumonia, and IDH differentiation syndrome, the latter of which can be life-threatening and requires careful management.233235 Noticeably, IDH differentiation syndrome is one of the potentially lethal entities that require prompt recognition and more appropriate management.236 Enasidenib is also being explored for other conditions caused by IDH2 mutations, such as D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria type II,237 chondrosarcoma,238 angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (NCT02273739), and malignant sinonasal or skull base tumors (NCT06176989). | Ivosidenib, targeting mutated IDH1, was first approved by the FDA in July 2018 for RR AML.239 In April 2022, with the data from a completed phase III clinical trial being made public, the therapeutic potentials and good safety of the combination of azacitidine and ivosidinib among patients with AML received broader attention.240 Subsequently, the FDA approved this regimen for elderly patients with newly diagnosed IDH1-mutated AML in May 2022.241 Besides AML, ivosidenib is approved for MDS and cholangiocarcinoma, with ongoing phase III studies in unresectable or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with IDH1 mutations.216,242 The most significant adverse events include ascites and other severe conditions, necessitating vigilant monitoring.242 Ivosidenib has also shown promising results in phase I clinical trials for IDH-mutated advanced glioma, with a daily dose of 500 mg proving effective in reducing 2-HG levels and controlling the disease.243246 Olutasidenib, an oral IDH1 inhibitor, was approved by the FDA in December 2022 for treating RR AML with specific IDH1 mutations. | Notable grade 3-4 adverse events included increases in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, indicating the need for careful liver function monitoring during treatment.249 EZH2 inhibitors Currently, two EZH2 inhibitors, tazemetostat (EPZ-6438) and valemetostat tosilate (DS-3201, DS-3201B), targeting EZH12 or EZH2 have been approved and are being utilized in various therapeutic strategies. | Tazemetostat, the first oral EZH2 inhibitor, was approved by the FDA in January 2020 for patients over 16 years of age with advanced epithelioid sarcoma that is ineligible for complete resection.250 It is also the first targeted drug for epithelioid sarcoma treatment.251 In a phase II clinical trial (NCT02601950), tazemetostat demonstrated good tolerability and clinical activity, with a low incidence of severe treatment-related adverse events such as anemia and weight loss.252 Tazemetostat has also been studied as a monotherapy in RR follicular lymphoma (FL), showing promising, durable responses and an acceptable safety profile.253,254 Common severe adverse events included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia.254 In Japan, a phase III trial evaluated tazemetostat 800 mg twice daily in RR EZH2 mutation-positive FL, showing encouraging response rates and tolerability, which helped to accelerate its approval by the FDA and PMDA for this indication.255,256 Furthermore, tazemetostat is being investigated as a single agent for malignant mesothelioma, with ongoing efforts to refine biomarkers for its activity in malignant pleural mesothelioma.257 Research is also underway to assess the efficacy and tolerability of tazemetostat in combination with other therapeutic agents, including programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors, chemotherapy, and targeted therapeutics across different tumor types.258260 Notably, phase III clinical trials are exploring tazemetostat in combination with lenalidomide and rituximab (NCT04224493) or doxorubicin (NCT04204941) focusing on RR FL and epithelioid sarcoma, which are highly anticipated for their potential to redefine treatment paradigms. | Valemetostat tosilate is an innovative dual inhibitor of EZH12 that received approval from the PMDA in Japan for the treatment of RR adult T-cell leukemialymphoma (ATL) in September 2022.261 It is administered orally and should be taken on an empty stomach to avoid adverse food effects.262 Dosage adjustments are necessary when valemetostat is used concurrently with strong inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3 A and P-glycoprotein, which can affect its metabolism and excretion.263 In a multicenter phase 2 trial involving patients with RR aggressive ATL, valemetostat demonstrated promising efficacy, even in heavily pretreated patients. | Many small molecule inhibitors and agonists targeting epigenetic-modifying enzymes are being identified and progressively advancing into the early stages of clinical trials. | a Epigenetics-targeted drugs are developed through the virtual screening of compound libraries, drug design based on molecular structure, and the exploration of potential mechanisms of known agents. | Subsequently, applying PROTAC, CRISPRCas, and other technologies or mechanisms to optimize the physical properties, and inhibitory or agonistic effects of compounds. | The aberrant activity of these enzymes is closely linked with the pathogenesis of a wide range of diseases, not only cancers but also metabolic, inflammatory, and neurological disorders, underscoring the therapeutic relevance of targeting these pathways.269272 Therefore, DNA methylation provides a promising platform for developing epigenetics-targeted drugs in clinical practice (Table 3).Table 3Summary of DNA

inhibitors, which suppress the expression or enzymatic activities of DNMTs, thereby counteracting improper DNA methylation patterns. | These inhibitors are crucial in correcting the abnormal addition of methyl groups to DNA, a common feature in many pathologies. | DNMT inhibitors Most DNMT inhibitors under investigation are employed in treating hematological or solid tumors, with a smaller portion used for inflammatory or proliferative benign diseases.153,273 DNMT inhibitors fall into two principal categories based on their mechanisms of action: nucleoside DNA methylation inhibitors and non-nucleoside DNA methylation inhibitors. | These compounds integrate into the DNA structure and are recognized by DNMTs during DNA replication, thereby obstructing normal DNA methylation processes.274 Another significant compound, guadecitabine (SGI110, an antimetabolite of decitabine), represents a second-generation DNA methylation inhibitor. | However, although guadecitabine has demonstrated good tolerance and favorable outcomes in many clinical trials, there is still clinical evidence indicating that its application may cause serious treatment-related adverse effects, such as pneumonia, sepsis, aspiration pneumonia, metabolic disorders, neutropenia, leukopenia, and pruritis.276,277 Furthermore, a recent phase II clinical trial conducted among patients with succinate dehydrogenase-deficient tumors was terminated due to low objective response rates.278 Additionally, when combined with traditional antitumor agents such as chemotherapeutic drugs and immune checkpoint blockade agents, guadecitabine demonstrates a potent synergistic effect, enhancing long-term clinical benefits.279282 Promisingly, its use in treating patients with AML has advanced to phase III clinical trials, indicating high response rates and comparable safety, positioning it as a promising future alternative.279,283 Other nucleoside DNA methylation inhibitors include CP-4200, with cellular uptake less dependent on the nucleoside transporters involved in azacytidine uptake;284 F-aza-T-dCyd (NSC801845), optimized structurally from T-dCyd, F-T-dCyd, and Aza-T-dCyd;285 DHDAC, which is less cytotoxic and more stable;286 NPEOC-DAC, a decitabine derivative modified at the N4 position of the azacitidine ring, displaying significantly reduced potency at low doses in inhibiting DNA methylation;287 and zebularine, known for its high selectivity and better biocompatibility towards pathological cells,288 demonstrating significant therapeutic effects not only on tumors but also on non-tumor diseases like renal fibrosis,289 T2DM,290 and NAFLD.291 Additionally, clofarabine, an FDA-approved purine nucleoside analog for treating pediatric AML, primarily inhibits DNA biosynthesis and the ribonucleotide reductase enzyme and has shown potential in early-stage carcinogenesis through DNMT1 inhibition.292 Beyond these, various non-nucleoside DNMT inhibitors have been identified. | These include specific artificially synthesized inhibitors and naturally occurring agents with a demethylation function.293,294 Enhancements to the physical properties of these natural compounds, such as solubility and stability, benefit the development of more effective DNMT-targeted inhibitors.295,296 Non-nucleoside DNMT inhibitors are categorized based on their diverse mechanisms of action into competitors of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), competitive or non-competitive inhibitors of DNMT, regulators of DNMT expression, and binders of DNA substrates.53 MG98 and hydralazine are the only two drugs currently in clinical trials. | Targeting the eraser of DNA methylation: TET Due to the significant heterogeneity in the roles that TET enzymes play across various diseases, the effectiveness of targeting TET enzymes as a therapeutic strategy depends on the specific disease or even different stages within a disease.305 While there are currently no epigenetic-targeted drugs that modulate TET available on the market, experimental studies and clinical trials suggest that reshaping methylation landscapes through TET inhibitors and agonists may be a viable approach to treating diseases. | TET inhibitors To date, numerous small molecules have been identified that inhibit TET enzymes. | Research into these TET inhibitors primarily focuses on elucidating their underlying molecular mechanisms. | We categorize these inhibitors into three groups based on their distinct mechanisms of action, which will be discussed in detail below. | C35 exhibits potent inhibitory effects on all members of the TET family.306,307 In contrast, the effects of auranofin and eltrombopag are specific to TET1 and TET2, respectively.308,309 Notably, eltrombopag, a nonpeptidyl thrombopoietin receptor agonist approved by the US FDA for use in patients with aplastic anemia as an iron chelator.310 Recently, Guan et al.309 reported the negative effects of eltrombopag on TET2. | Additionally, synthetic compounds like dimethyloxallylglycine and TETi76, which mimic the properties of α-KG, serve as competitive inhibitors of TET.316,317 These agents represent a novel approach to developing TET inhibitors. | Bobcat339 induces the degradation of TET3 directly,318 and its inhibitory effects on TET1 and TET2 are observed only in the presence of coordinating copper(II).321 NSC-370284 and UC-514321 bind directly to the DNA-binding domain of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) or STAT5, transcriptional activators of TET1, leading to suppressed expression of TET1 in vivo.320 This mechanism has been confirmed in mouse models of AML and medulloblastoma, showing synergistic effects with standard chemotherapy.320,322 The therapeutic potential of these compounds in additional diseases is an exciting area for future research. | TET agonists As previously discussed, TET inhibitors are highly valued for treating diseases. | Most TET agonists currently under investigation are drugs that upregulate cofactors of TET, such as vitamin C and enzymes involved in α-KG metabolism; other small molecules, including 3-nitroflavanones,295 retinoic acid,323 ioperamide hydrochloride,324 and mitoxantrone,325 are reported to directly upregulate TET expression. | In tumor cells, IDH12 mutations lead to the production of the oncometabolite 2-HG, which competes with α-KG for binding sites on TET, potentially leading to reversible inhibition of TET proteins and dysregulation of DNA methylation levels.338,339 The administration of enasidinib and siRNA against IDH2 has been shown to restore the low methylated state of the genome, consistent with the reactivation of TET enzymatic activities.340342 However, observations suggest that other α-KG-dependent enzymes, such as histone demethylases and prolyl hydroxylases, might play a more dominant role in the progression of IDH-mutant diseases.343 These findings highlight the potential for developing TET agonists based on IDH inhibitors to reshape the epigenetic landscape, warranting further investigation. | Additionally, inhibiting α-KG dehydrogenase enhances α-KG levels and TET activities, restoring DNA demethylation and ameliorating the progression of T2DM and breast cancer.344,345 Similarly, IOX1, an inhibitor of α-KG oxygenases and a potent inhibitor of lysine demethylase 3 A (KDM3A) and KDM4A, has been found to reduce TET enzymatic activities in helper T cells, emerging as a potential epigenetic drug for various autoimmune diseases.346 In conclusion, α-KG represents a promising target for TET-targeted drug development that should be further explored in clinical trials. | Targeting the reader of DNA methylation: MBD and UHRF1 With the discovery of proteins that read methylated DNA sites, burgeoning research has aimed to identify small molecules targeting these enzymes, sparking considerable enthusiasm for developing novel therapeutic targets. | MBD inhibitors The MBD protein family, critical readers of DNA methylation, consists of six members: methyl-CpG-binding protein 1 (MeCP1), MeCP2, MBD1, MBD2, MBD3, and MBD4.347 The aberrant activities and expression of these proteins observed in various diseases have recently positioned them as potential targets for epigenetic drugs. | Current research predominantly focuses on MBD2 inhibitors, which are rapidly progressing. | The development of MBD2 inhibitors hinges on two prerequisite factors. | Firstly, the knockdown of MBD2 or the application of targeted siRNA has demonstrated positive effects in tumor treatment, underscoring the therapeutic potential of targeting MBD2.348 Secondly, successfully elucidating MBD2s molecular structure and associated mechanisms lays the scientific groundwork for identifying and designing inhibitory molecules. | MBD2 inhibitors can be categorized into three groups based on their mechanisms of action. | The first group disrupts the binding of the N-terminal MBD to methylated DNA.349 Through docking analysis, molecules such as CID3100583 and 8,8-ethylenebistheophylline have been identified to target the interaction between MBD2 and DNA.350 The second category aims to block the interaction between the C-terminal coiled-coil domain and the GATA zinc finger domain containing 2A, which has shown potent inhibitory effects on MBD2-dependent DNA methylation.351 However, no drugs based on this mechanism are currently in use, highlighting a gap in research that demands further exploration. | The third group prevents the interaction with HDAC and the formation of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex via an intrinsically disordered region.352354 Utilizing this concept, Na et al.355 developed a novel technique that efficiently discriminates potential compounds interacting with intrinsically disordered proteins through expanded virtual screening. | This approach led to identifying two MBD2 inhibitors, ABA and APC. | UHRF1 inhibitors Ubiquitin-like with plant homeodomain (PHD) and RING finger domains 1 (UHRF1) plays a pivotal role in recruiting DNMT1 during replication, primarily through the recognition of hemimethylated DNA and the subsequent flipping of hemimethylated CpG sites via the SET and RING associated domain (SRA).356358 UHRF1 also interacts with HDAC1 and facilitates the di- and tri-methylation of H3, contributing to the ubiquitination of histones and the formation of heterochromatin.359 The upregulation of UHRF1 has been observed in various pathologies, particularly in tumors, making it a promising target for therapeutic intervention.360,361 The initial identification of small inhibitors targeting the SRA domain of UHRF1 was based on structure-based screening and computational analyses. | Advanced screening techniques, such as nonequilibrium capillary electrophoresis of the equilibrium mixture, have facilitated the identification of proanthocyanidins and baicalein as promising inhibitors.366 Furthermore, Ciaco et al.367 reported the development of novel UHRF1 inhibitors, AMSA2 and MPB7, based on the structure of UM63. | These inhibitors suppress SRA-mediated base-flipping activities without DNA intercalation and demonstrate minimal effects on non-cancer cells, offering a basis for further optimization. | In addition to the SRA domain, the tandem Tudor domain and PHD domain of UHRF1, which are involved in recognizing methylated lysine and arginine residues on H3, have also become targets for inhibitor design.368,369 While some inhibitors targeting these domains have been reported, their effects have only been validated in vitro, and more evidence is needed before proceeding to clinical trials.370372 Current research suggests that inhibiting UHRF1 alone may not be sufficient to restore gene silencing affected by hypermethylation. | However, combining UHRF1 inhibitors with other epigenetic inhibitors, such as HDAC inhibitors, can lead to synergistic effects and improved therapeutic outcomes.373,374 Consequently, multi-target inhibitors have been developed and are emerging as clinical candidates for tumor therapy.375378 Additionally, the use of small molecules that act as UHRF1 degraders, such as diosgenin and MK2206, has been explored for prostate cancer treatment, representing a novel therapeutic approach.379,380 Natural substances like hinokitiol have shown therapeutic effects in mouse models in a UHRF1 depletion-dependent manner although the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated and represent a direction for future research.381 Epigenetics-targeted drugs and histone acetylation The dynamic equilibrium and normal function of histone acetylation and deacetylation are regulated by the cooperative actions of the lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) and HDAC families, along with various reader proteins. | The development of related epigenetic drugs is ongoing, offering new therapeutic options for treating these conditions (Table 4).Table 4Summary of histone acetylation-targeted drugs for different diseases in clinical trialsTypeDrugTarget(s)Condition(s)Statusoutcome(s)Phase(s)Other

KAT inhibitors Numerous inhibitors targeting KAT have been developed, primarily focusing on the P300CBP, GNATPCAF, and MYST classes.386388 These enzymes contain two accessible domains: the acetyl-lysine binding BD and the catalytic domain, utilizing acetyl CoA as a cofactor to transfer acetyl groups. | Thus, designed inhibitors can target the enzymatic activity and the binding sites for acetyl CoA. | These degraders are ternary complexes comprising ligands for targeted proteins and E3 ubiquitin ligase, along with a connecting linker, allowing targeted degradation via a ubiquitination-dependent method.389 Five KAT inhibitors have entered clinical practice, including CCS1477, FT-7051, NEO2734, PRI-724, and PF-07248144. | FT-7051, another P300CBP inhibitor targeting the BD domain, has been shown to reduce H3K27Ac at specific promoter sites and is currently under study in a phase I clinical trial for patients with hormone receptor-positive prostate cancer.392 NEO2734, a dual P300CBP and BET inhibitor, demonstrates therapeutic potential comparable to the combination of a BET inhibitor and a P300CBP inhibitor in treating certain cancers.393,394 It is currently being evaluated in a phase I clinical trial focusing on castration-resistant prostate cancer and other advanced solid tumors to assess its maximum tolerated oral dose (NCT05488548). | PRI-724 effectively disrupts the interaction between β-catenin and CBP, ameliorating various diseases by inhibiting the Wntβ-catenin signaling pathway.395 Its safety, tolerability, and antifibrotic effects have been further evaluated in two completed clinical trials among patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)- and HBV-induced cirrhosis.396,397 However, PRI-724 fails to exhibit sufficient evidence of improvement in hepatic function according to existing data.396 Lastly, PF-07248144, a selective inhibitor of KAT6 (a member of the MOZMORF family), is currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of advanced breast cancer (NCT04606446). | In summary, KATs represent compelling targets for therapeutic strategies, and developing novel and high-quality inhibitors with improved safety and efficacy is reaching an exciting phase. | Using inhibitors and agonists of HDACs and sirtuins to correct abnormal acetylation patterns is a promising therapeutic strategy.398,399 Notably, the therapeutic effectiveness of these interventions, in an epigenetic-dependent manner, hinges on the participation of target enzymes in histone deacetylation. | HDAC inhibitors HDAC inhibitors are designed based on the spatial structure of their targets, characterized by highly conserved and homologous catalytic domains, including a catalytic channel, a zinc cation, and secondary pockets. | Most HDAC inhibitors consist of a surface binding region, binding to the catalytic channel, and a zinc-binding group along with the linker, chelating the zinc ion.400 Four main categories of HDAC inhibitors are extensively studied: pan-inhibitors, selective inhibitors, multitarget agents, and PROTACs-based HDAC degraders.398 We will now discuss the recent applications of these HDAC inhibitors in clinical trials. | Four FDA-approved HDAC inhibitorsvorinostat, romidepsin, belinostat, and panobinostatdemonstrate a pan-inhibitory effect on almost all HDAC members and have made significant progress in treating some hematological malignancies. | This success has fueled enthusiasm for developing additional pan-inhibitors to expand the clinical indications of these drugs. | Currently, several pan-inhibitors, including ivaltinostat (CG200745), AR-42, abexinostat (PCI-24781), bisthianostat (CF-367), and sodium valproate, are under clinical trials for various tumors. | Abexinostat, an oral small pan-inhibitor, whether used as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents, has shown promising therapeutic potential and acceptable safety profiles in solid tumors and hematological malignancies.404406 Notably, a phase III study on abexinostat for locally advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma is ongoing in various regions, highlighting its potential as a clinical candidate (NCT03592472). | Bisthianostat, a novel bisthiazole-derived pan-HDAC inhibitor, was studied in phase 1a clinical trial.407 Although preliminary data suggested modest efficacy and tolerability as a single agent in patients with RR MM, this study has been terminated for undisclosed reasons (NCT03618602). | The non-selective inhibition characteristic of pan-HDAC inhibitors often leads to a broad spectrum of adverse effects and off-target toxicities, which restrict their widespread clinical application.408 Given the diverse roles of different HDAC classes, there is increasing interest in developing selective HDAC inhibitors, viewed as promising alternatives with better tolerance.409,410 However, due to a lack of evidence supporting the involvement of HDAC567810 in histone deacetylation, selective inhibitors targeting these enzymes are not typically included in summaries of epigenetic-targeted drugs.411 Chidamide and givinostat, both FDA-approved selective inhibitors, have shown superior therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles. | Givinostat, in particular, has promisingly expanded the clinical indications of HDAC inhibitors to include non-tumor diseases. | Beyond these marketed drugs, several selective inhibitors have entered clinical practice. | Notably, four such inhibitors are undergoing phase III clinical trials: pracinostat (NCT03151408), entinostat,412 magnesium valproate (NCT00533299), and tacedinaline (NCT00005093). | Among these, only the phase III trial of entinostat combined with exemestane in treating hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer has shown satisfactory efficacy and manageable toxicities.412 However, among patients with other types of tumors such as colorectal carcinoma, lung cancer, endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma, and hematologic malignancies, entinostat fails to improve survival despite exhibiting good clinical efficacy.413416 Importantly, according to an early-terminated, phase I clinical trial that evaluated the combination of entinostat, hydroxychloroquine, and regorafenib, the drug regimen among patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma was poorly tolerated, with higher risks of weight loss, fatigue, and anorexia.413 Despite these advancements, selective inhibitors still face significant developmental challenges as they emerge as the next generation of HDAC inhibitors. | Recently, multitarget agents-based HDAC inhibitors have gained attention and have been posited to perform versatile roles in disease treatment.417419 Various such agents, including those dual-targeting HDACs and kinases, receptors, DNA, transcriptional factors, and apoptosis-related proteins, are under preclinical investigation. | Examples include curcumin (previously mentioned as a DNMTMETTL3 inhibitor), CUDC-101, tinostamustine (EDO-S101), fimepinostat (CUDC-907), domatinostat (4SC-202), and dacinostat (NVP-LAQ824, LAQ824), all of which are involved in various clinical trials.398 It has been widely reported that these multitarget agents enhance safety and reduce drug resistance in various diseases, both as monotherapy and in combination with radiotherapy or chemotherapy.420423 However, emerging research offers a contrasting perspective. | In a recent phase Ib clinical trial focusing on domatinostat (a dual inhibitor of LSD1HDAC) in patients with advanced melanoma, the drug failed to enhance the efficacy of treatments targeting anti-PD-1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) while unexpected severe skin toxicity was observed.424 Furthermore, as current knowledge about these multitarget agents is still primarily derived from early-stage clinical trials, extensive investigations are necessary to validate their therapeutic value in a broader population. | HDAC agonists While HDAC inhibitors have been extensively studied, research on HDAC agonists has been less prevalent. | Theophylline, used initially as an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase and adenosine receptors in treating asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, has recently shown activated effects on HDAC in low doses. | This left no significant difference from the anti-inflammatory properties of standard therapy.426 SIRT inhibitors and agonists The sirtuin familys role in developing various diseases, including inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer, underscores the importance of exploring molecules that modulate their activity. | Notably, SIRT2 is involved in the deacetylation of histone H4 during the G2M transition and mitosis but is predominantly found in the cytosol, where it participates in non-histone deacetylation.427,428 SIRT3-5 are mainly located in mitochondria and possess a mitochondrial targeting sequence,429 while SIRT7 is primarily found in the nucleus, though fewer studies have addressed molecules that regulate its activity.430 Consequently, the inhibitors and agonists of SIRT1 and SIRT6 are highlighted as promising epigenetics-targeted drugs with significant potential. | From a mechanistic perspective, five classes of inhibitors of SIRT1 have been identified: First, competitive inhibitors that vie for acylated substrates at the binding sites, exemplified by natural products such as sirtinol, splitomicin, and cambinol analogs;431,432 Second, competitive inhibitors that challenge NAD for binding sites, including selisistat (EX-527) and Sosbo;433435 Third, adenosine analogs such as Ro 31-8220;436,437 Further, binary inhibitors that compete with substrates or cofactors at separate binding sites, represented by ELT-31, a non-selective SIRT1-3 inhibitor;438 And the last, non-competitive inhibitors, including nicotinamide and its analogs, tenovins, thioacetyl-lysine peptides, and other small peptides.439441 EX527, one of the few sirtuin inhibitors in clinical use, has demonstrated antitumor effects in vitro and potential as an adjunct in tumor therapy.442 Additionally, it has proven safe and well-tolerated within the therapeutic concentration range for treating neurodegenerative diseases.443 However, minimal therapeutic effects were observed in a phase I clinical trial focusing on early-stage HD, with further large-scale trials needed to explore its clinical potential.444 Ongoing research also investigates EX-527s potential roles in improving other metabolic diseases, including endotoxemia,445 diabetic nephropathy,446 and infertility (NCT04184323) remains ongoing. | Utilizing computational tools to predict potential allosteric sites has led to the identification of some allosteric SIRT6 inhibitors, including JYQ-42,447 compound 11e,448 and a pyrrole-pyridinimidazole derivative.449,450 Given that histone deacetylation catalyzed by SIRT6 promotes both tumor and non-tumor diseases, designing and in-depth study of these allosteric SIRT6 inhibitors represent a promising research field for human disease treatment.451,452 The agonists of the sirtuin family have been widely studied since the discovery of the first SIRT1 agonist, resveratrol, in 2003.453 The initially discovered sirtuin agonists mainly upregulate target enzyme activity through allosteric effects and are classified into two primary categories based on their origins. | The first category comprises natural products extracted from plants, including resveratrol and other polyphenolic molecules.454459 The second category consists of synthesized agonists that exhibit greater selectivity, focusing particularly on SIRT1, such as SRT1460, SRT1720, SRT2104, SRT2183, and SRT3025, as well as those targeting SIRT6, including UBCS039 and MDL-800.460 Additionally, compounds that are suggested to upregulate SIRT1 expression have been identified. | These molecules may activate all sirtuin members with a single compound, attracting considerable attention.472 Given the diverse roles of NAD in multiple signaling pathways, additional discussion is needed to determine whether drugs that increase NAD levels have therapeutic effects in a sirtuin-dependent manner. | BET inhibitors In recent years, a substantial number of BET inhibitors have been identified, encompassing pan-inhibitors, BD1BD2 selective inhibitors, dual inhibitors of kinases and BET, and PROTACs-based inhibitors.60,473,474 From a therapeutic standpoint, BET inhibitors are primarily developed for treating tumors, with some also showing potential in non-tumor diseases, such as VYN-201 and VYN-202, among other BD2 selective inhibitors.475 More than twenty BET inhibitors have progressed to clinical trials, with several undergoing advanced phase evaluations. | Notably, apabetalone (RVX-208) stands out as the sole BD2-selective inhibitor in phase III trials for addressing cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders such as T2DM.476478 Apabetalone demonstrates significant anti-inflammatory properties, providing a robust scientific basis for its ongoing clinical evaluation.479481 Another BET inhibitor, pelabresib (CPI-0610), has also reached phase III trials and shows promise as a treatment for myelofibrosis.482 In earlier phase II studies, pelabresib combined with ruxolitinib surpassed the efficacy of Janus kinase inhibitor monotherapy in treating symptomatic myelofibrosis while maintaining a manageable safety profile.483,484 ZEN-3694, a leading pan-BET inhibitor, has advanced to phase II trials, demonstrating efficacy when used with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) inhibitors and conventional chemotherapy in cancer treatment.485 Preliminary phase IbIIa trials indicate that ZEN-3694, in combination with enzalutamide, is beneficial for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.486 An increasing number of trials focusing on ZEN-3694 are currently underway, which will provide further data to evaluate its therapeutic promise. | Furthermore, recent reports highlight dinaciclib, a well-known CDK inhibitor, now recognized for its novel activity in BET suppression.487 The dual inhibitory capability of dinaciclib presents a potential strategy to counteract BET resistance in AML treatment.487 These developments underscore the potential of these drugs to achieve market approval for broad clinical use. | However, some BET inhibitors as single-agent therapies have shown mixed outcomes in clinical trials for distinct cancer settings, despite their excellent results in preclinical models.488 For example, several phases 1 and 2 clinical trials investigating the therapeutic effect of birabresib on solid or hematological malignancies were terminated prematurely because of limited efficacy (NCT02698176, NCT02698189, NCT02698176, NCT02296476). | Therefore, combining BET inhibitors with other traditional drugs may open new possibilities for the development of antitumor strategies. | Numerous novel BET inhibitors have been identified recently, enhancing the landscape of therapeutic options. | These include OPN-51107, a pan-BET inhibitor that mitigates T cell dysfunction in chronic lymphocytic leukemia;489 XL-126, a BD1-selective inhibitor noted for its potent anti-inflammatory effects;490 and DW-71177, another BD1-selective inhibitor geared towards AML treatment.491 Additional developments involve brain-permeable BD1-selective inhibitors for multiple sclerosis treatment,492 compounds with dual HDACBET inhibitory action for challenging tumors,493 phenoxyaryl pyridone derivatives as BD2-selective inhibitors for AML,494 and SRX3177, a potent triple-action CDK46-phosphoinositide 3-kinase-BET inhibitor for respiratory diseases linked to β-coronavirus.495 These advancements significantly contribute to understanding BET-targeted drug development, designing small molecule inhibitors tailored to the diverse pathological characteristics of human diseases. | YEATS domain inhibitors Identified in 2014, the YEATS domain-comprising YAF9, ENL, AF9, TAF14, and SAS5serves as a novel reader for histone acetylation. | These proteins are primarily implicated in the pathogenesis of tumors, particularly hematologic malignancies, and represent promising targets for epigenetic therapies.499502 Research has shown that the YEATS domain binds to acylated lysine side chains through a common binding pocket and engages in π-π-π stacking interactions, providing a structural and theoretical foundation for developing targeted inhibitors.503 A significant milestone was the identification of the first small-molecule chemical probe, SGC-iMLLT, which targets ENL and its paralog AF9. | This probes inhibitory effects were validated in biological assays.504 Furthermore, another approach involves blocking the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between YEATS domain proteins and disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like (DOT1L), effectively suppressing the activity of YEATS domain proteins.505,506 Current research is focused on developing selective inhibitors for various YEATS domain proteins, with the deepest insights into ENL inhibitors. | In 2022, Liu et al.507 highlighted the promising potential of the oral ENL inhibitor TDI-11055 in treating AML in mouse models, advancing the clinical application of ENL inhibitors for AML treatment. | Additionally, combination therapies involving ENL inhibitors with KAT or BET inhibitors have been emphasized.508,509 In 2020, Jiang et al.510 introduced the first selective inhibitor targeting the AF9 YEATS domain, presenting a novel cyclopeptide for in-depth exploration of the functional similarities and differences between AF9 and ENL, thereby laying the groundwork for novel YEATS domain inhibitor development. | An optimized method for the solid-phase synthesis of these inhibitory cyclopeptides has since been proposed, significantly reducing preparation time and enhancing yield.510 Moreover, the study of amide-π interactions between histone acyl-lysine and the AF9 YEATS domain has led to the development of chemical compounds that disrupt this noncovalent interaction, notably those incorporating urea or aromatic rings.511,512 In 2021, the first selective GAS41 inhibitor was reported; this synthesized molecule binds to dimerized GAS41 YEATS domains and blocks interaction with acetylated histone H3 in cancer cell lines.513 PHD finger domain inhibitors BD and PHD finger-containing protein (BRPF) and BD and PHD finger transcription factor (BPTF) are crucial targets involved in tumor progression and the development of resistance to molecularly targeted therapy drugs, such as kinase inhibitors and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors.514516 To date, an array of BRPF inhibitors featuring distinctive scaffoldssuch as 3-acetyl-indole, 1,3-dimethylquinolin-2-one, 1,3-dimethyl benzimidazole, 1-(indolin-1-yl)ethan-1-one, 1,3-dimethylquinolin-2-one, and 2,3-dioxo-quinoxalinehas been identified. | These compounds represent novel avenues for therapeutic innovation.517522 However, as the inhibitory effects of these agents have primarily been confirmed in vitro, extensive efforts are required to advance these drugs to clinical trials. | BPTF inhibitor development has not kept pace with those targeting other proteins with BD motifs, primarily remaining within fragment-based drug discovery. | Only a handful have been tested in vivo or in vitro to demonstrate their inhibitory actions and therapeutic potential. | AU1, the first small molecule selective for BPTF, has shown effectiveness in mouse models of gastric cancer and neuroblastoma.516,523,524 Bromosporine has exhibited significant antitumor effects in breast cancer and melanoma, suggesting promising therapeutic strategies for solid tumors.525,526 The novel selective inhibitor C620-0696 has shown cytotoxic effects in non-small-cell lung cancer cells overexpressing BPTF.527 The continued exploration of these inhibitors in oncology is highly anticipated. | Recent advances in biochemistry and understanding of pathogenesis have led to identifying and developing small-molecule inhibitors that target aberrant demethylation patterns (Table 5).Table 5Summary of histone methylation-targeted drugs for different diseases in clinical

methyltransferases (HMTs), including KMTs and protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs), are central to regulating histone methylation and are implicated in numerous biological and pathological processes. | Notably, innovative drug discovery strategies for HMT proteinssuch as covalent inhibition independent of SAM-competitive or substrate-competitive mechanisms, dual-target inhibition, and targeted degradation strategieshave received considerable attention and have rapidly progressed.528530 These inhibitors, in addition to marketed drugs, are being advanced to clinical practice for further evaluation and oversight. | EZH2 inhibitors Since the identification of the suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 1 (SUV39H1), the inaugural histone KMT8 discovered in 2000, numerous proteins mediating histone methylation have been reported. | These include EZH12, euchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2 (G9aEHMT2), G9a-like protein (GLPEHMT1), DOT1L, and various SET domain-containing histone lysine methyltransferase (SETD) and nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein (NSD) families.531533 Over recent decades, considerable efforts have focused on developing efficient and selective inhibitors targeting various histone KMT subfamilies with potential therapeutic applications in disease treatment.534537 In addition to the two marketed drugs summarized in the previous section, tazemetostat (EPZ-6438) and valemetostat (DS-3201b), numerous novel EZH2 inhibitors are under investigation, with several advances in clinical studies, particularly compounds featuring the 2-pyridone moiety which encompass both bicyclic heteroaromatic and monocyclic aromatic rings.538 CPI-1205 (lirametostat) has undergone evaluation in three clinical trials (NCT03480646, NCT03525795, NCT02395601) to assess its tolerance and therapeutic potential. | CPI-0209 (tulmimetostat), an oral, next-generation dual EZH2EZH1 inhibitor developed by the same company, is currently under clinical trial for treating both solid tumors and hematological malignancies (NCT05944562, NCT05942300, NCT04104776). | SHR2554, a highly selective EZH2 inhibitor, has demonstrated potent efficacy both in vitro and in vivo.539 Its first-in-human, dose-escalation, and dose-expansion phase 1 trial conducted at 13 hospitals in China in 2018 indicated good tolerance and promising antitumor activity in patients with RR lymphomas.540,541 A pharmacokinetic study revealed that combining itraconazole, an inhibitor of CYP3A4-metabolizing enzymes, with SHR2554 improves its plasma concentration while maintaining a favorable safety profile, suggesting a new therapeutic strategy.542 PF-06821497, a lactam-derived EZH2 inhibitor, was optimized from a series of similar compounds using ligand-based and physicochemical-property-based strategies, showing optimal inhibitory and therapeutic effects in mouse models.543 It also has demonstrated synergistic effects in combination with HDAC inhibitors, inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis in cancer cell lines.544 Currently, two clinical studies are exploring appropriate administration methods for PF-06821497, such as intravenous injection or oral intake, and whether it can be consumed with food (NCT06392230, NCT05767905). | In addition to demonstrating a strong therapeutic effect in tumor treatment in animal models, GSK126 has also achieved significant breakthroughs in enhancing β-like cell regeneration among patients with T1DM.111,545 However, a terminated phase I clinical trial revealed insufficient evidence of clinical activity for GSK126 at tolerable doses.546 XNW5004 (NCT06022757) and AXT-1003 (NCT05965505) are innovative EZH2 inhibitors currently in clinical trials, reflecting ongoing advancements in this therapeutic area. | Moreover, astemizole, originally an antiallergy medication inhibiting histamine receptor H1, has recently been shown to disrupt the EZH2-embryonic ectoderm development (EED) PPI within the PRC2, offering new perspectives in developing EZH2PRC2 inhibitors.547 DOT1L inhibitors EPZ-5676 (pinometostat), EPZ004777, and SGC0946 are three selective inhibitors of DOT1L that are currently under extensive research. | EPZ-004777 was the first SAM-competitive inhibitor of DOT1L to demonstrate in vivo efficacy.548 Despite showing promising therapeutic effects in various subtypes of AML through cell experiments and animal models, EPZ-004777s preclinical application has been largely constrained by its pharmacokinetic characteristics.549,550 EPZ-5676 has been developed to improve selectivity and inhibition effects, showing potential as a therapeutic agent for mixed lineage leukemia (MLL).551 Early investigations using patient-derived xenografts and mouse models have indicated that EPZ-5676 exhibits potent antileukemic activities, facilitating further evaluation.552,553 In three completed clinical trials (NCT01684150, NCT02141828, NCT03701295), EPZ-5676 has been assessed for safety, tolerability, and preliminary antitumor activity in pediatric patients with MLL, with the combination of EPZ-5676 and azacytidine in a phase IbII study expected to show synergistic antiproliferative activities (NCT03701295). | SGC0946, a brominated analog, serves as another selective inhibitor of DOT1L. | Its therapeutic potential, either as monotherapy or in combination with other inhibitors such as HDACs and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, has been observed in various solid tumors, setting the groundwork for clinical trials of SGC0946.554556 Beyond EZH2 and DOT1L, several inhibitors targeting other subfamilies are being investigated in clinical studies, including EZM0414 and KTX-1001. | EZM0414, a novel inhibitor of SETD2 derived from the optimization of EPZ-719, exhibits improved pharmacokinetic properties and potent pharmacodynamic activity in mouse xenograft models.557 A phase IIb clinical trial is currently underway to explore the safety, tolerability, and therapeutic efficacy of EZM0414 in patients with RR MM and RR diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (NCT05121103). | KTX-1001, a selective NSD2 inhibitor, has been FDA-approved for clinical trials since 2022 and is being studied in a phase I trial to treat patients with RR MM (NCT05651932). | PRMT inhibitors Significant progress has been made in developing inhibitors for type I PRMTs (PRMT1-4, 6, and 8) and a selective inhibitor targeting PRMT5, with several agents entering the early phases of clinical trials. | Two type I PRMTs inhibitors are already in clinical stages, including GSK3368715 and CTS-2190. | GSK3368715 (EPZ019997), an oral, reversible inhibitor of PRMT168 developed for treating tumors and pulmonary disorders.558560 GSK3368715 underwent a phase 1 clinical trial for treating solid tumors and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in 2018. | However, the first clinical application of a PRMT1 inhibitor did not meet expectations and was terminated early in 2022 due to its ineffectivenes.561 Given the adverse events potentially caused by high and sustained concentrations of the inhibitor in vivo, research into PROTAC-based degraders of GSK3368715 has intensified, potentially offering therapeutic benefits at lower doses and reducing adverse effects.562 CTS-2190, another inhibitor targeting PRMT1346, received clinical trial approvals from the US FDA and China NMPA in February and April 2023, respectively. | Thirteen PRMT5 inhibitors have advanced to phase I and II clinical trials. | Among these, GSK3326595, JNJ64619178, and PF06939999 were the earliest selective PRMT5 inhibitors to receive clinical trial approvals. | GSK3326595 is a substrate-competitive inhibitor, while JNJ64619178 and PF-06939999 function as SAM-competitive agents.563565 The efficacy and understanding of GSK3326595 primarily rely on animal model data due to a lack of published results from completed clinical trials. | This inhibitor has been shown to induce DNA damage in cancer cells and enhance the antiproliferative effects of poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors, such as niraparib;566 however, long-term or chronic use of GSK3326595 is associated with potential liver-related adverse effects.567 A completed phase I clinical trial of JNJ-64619178 determined that a daily dose of 0.5 mg was better tolerated by participants with RR B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, though it demonstrated limited therapeutic effects.568 Conversely, PF-06939999 has shown an acceptable safety profile and clinical efficacy in its phase I trial.569 TNG908 and MRTX1719, both brain-penetrant PRMT5 inhibitors, have shown promise in selectively targeting cancer cells deficient in methylthioadenosine phosphorylase in both preclinical models and clinical trials.570,571 Phase III clinical trials for these drugs recruit participants to assess their therapeutic effects on various solid tumors (NCT05245500). | Prelude Therapeutics has developed PRT543 and PRT811, leading oral PRMT5 inhibitors whose safety profiles and preliminary therapeutic potential have been evaluated in phase I clinical trials (NCT04089449, NCT03886831). | Other PRMT5 inhibitors, such as AMG193, SH3765, TNG462, SCR6920, and SYHX-2001, are currently under investigation in clinical trials and are in the recruiting phase. | Given that most of the small molecules or core scaffolds of PRMT5 inhibitors have been examined only in cellular experiments, there remains a significant gap in knowledge regarding their efficacy and therapeutic effects in vivo. | Currently, representative inhibitors of diverse KDM proteins are being investigated. | Based on catalytic mechanisms, lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1KDM1A) inhibitors can be divided into irreversible and reversible inhibitors; KDM2-7 inhibitors are classified into four types: α-KG cofactor mimics or inhibitors of α-KG oxygenases (such as N-oxalylglycine), metal cofactor disruptors, histone substrate competitive inhibitors, and other substrate- and cofactor-independent inhibitors.574 KDM27 inhibitors KDM2 and KDM7 proteins, which belong to the JmjC-KDM subfamilies, share high similarity in their Fe(II)- and α-KG-binding residues.575 The development of inhibitors for KDM7 and KDM2 has typically co-occurred. | These compounds demonstrated antiproliferative activity in cancer cells by inhibiting KDM2A, KDM7A, and KDM7B.576 Similarly, Gerken et al.577 developed a series of novel KDM2A7A inhibitors characterized by saturated indoline ring systems. | These indoline-containing compounds exhibited potent and selective effects on KDM2A7A at low micromolar concentrations, with notable cellular activity. | Other selective inhibitors have also been identified, including a cyclic peptide inhibitor, OC9, designed to target the PHD finger domain of KDM7. | This inhibitor results in the inhibition of KDM7B and the activation of KDM7A.578 Through virtual screening of α-KG oxygenases, daminozide, a plant growth regulator, was found to selectively inhibit KDM2A. | The therapeutic potential of daminozide was observed in mouse models of osteoarthritis, pointing to new directions for developing 2KG-competed inhibitors with enhanced selectivity, although its use in humans is unlikely.579,580 KDM3 inhibitors In addition to IOX1, various inhibitors of the KDM3 family have been identified, most exhibiting a pan-inhibitory effect across all family members. | Through virtual screening of natural products and traditional Chinese medicine components, compounds JDI-4, JDI-12, and JDI-16 selectively bind to the JmjC domains of KDM3B and KDM3C.581 Subsequent in vitro and in vivo studies confirmed the inhibitory effect and antitumor potential of JDI-16 in a KDM3-dependent manner.581 Another compound, JDM-7, also identified from this screening, inhibits KDM3A and KDM3B in AML cell lines, although initial observations indicated limited effects on the KDM3 family.582 Additionally, through high-throughput screening of benzhydryl amine derivatives, CBA-1 was found to be a potent inhibitor of KDM3A, exhibiting antiproliferative effects on colorectal cancer cell lines.583 The use of CBA-1 in zebrafish models also showed minimal toxicity, suggesting its potential as a promising drug for clinical application.583 KDM4 inhibitors Given the critical roles of KDM4s in cancers and the inherent complexity of the KDM4 subfamily, significant efforts have been dedicated to developing KDM4 inhibitors. | These inhibitors are categorized into four previously reviewed classes: α-KG cofactor mimics, Metal cofactor disruptors, histone substrate competitive inhibitors, and inhibitors targeted reader domains, having been summarized extensively in previous work.584,585 In addition to these established categories, we emphasize the progress in novel inhibitors that have not yet been summarized, further expanding the scope of therapeutic options against KDM4-related cancers. | TACH101 is a novel pan-inhibitor of KDM4A-D, competitively inhibiting α-KG without affecting other KDM subfamilies. | The therapeutic effects of TACH101 have been demonstrated in organoids and xenograft models, suggesting its potential as an anticancer agent worthy of further investigation in animal studies.586 SD49-7, a derivative of SD70, is another novel KDM4 inhibitor. | KDM5 inhibitors KDM5 inhibitors have shown significant therapeutic potential, though many compounds still lack sufficient evidence to confirm their efficacy and safety in vivo. | A prevailing approach in KDM5 inhibition involves designing small molecules that compete with α-KG for binding sites.590 Among these, KDOAM-25 is a potent and selective inhibitor affecting MM and triple-negative breast cancer cells, with minimal adverse effects observed in vivo applications. | Nevertheless, its poor cell membrane permeability hinders its efficacy.591 RS3195 exhibits inhibitory effects on KDM5B and KDM5D in vitro. | Due to potential toxicity, RS5033 was developed as an alternative, featuring a phenyl ring instead of a pyrrole nucleus to improve tolerance.592 KDM5-C49, an analog of 2,4-PDCA, binds to KDM5B in vitro and inhibits its enzymatic activities.593 To enhance cell membrane permeability and selectivity, derivatives KDM5-C48 and KDM5-C70 have been developed.593595 Through high-throughput virtual screening, a series of cyclopentachromen derivatives targeting KDM5A have been identified as promising drugs due to their potent inhibitory effects and low toxicity.596 N70, a thienopyridine-based selective KDM5A inhibitor, displays α-KG-competitive inhibition, while its analog, N71, binds irreversibly to KDM5A through covalent modifications.597 Numerous compounds, identified through virtual screening and optimization of reported inhibitory molecules, employ different mechanisms of action.598,599 Among these, KDM5-inh1 and CPI-455 are broadly studied pan-inhibitors of KDM5. | GS-5801, designed from GS-080one of the most potent KDM5 inhibitorsshows significant anti-HBV activity. | Despite its promise, the in vivo effects of GS-5801 have not met expectations, underscoring the need for additional studies to enhance its efficacy.602 Utilizing the AlphaScreen method, ryuvidine was identified as an inhibitor of KMD5ABC, exhibiting substantial therapeutic impact on drug-tolerant cells.603 Dexmedetomidine, recently identified as a KDM5 inhibitor, is utilized to manage acute kidney injury in a KDM5-dependent manner.604 A novel approach was introduced by Yang et al.,605 who reported the first selective metal-based KDM5A inhibitor, rhodium(III) complex1. | This compound disrupts the interaction between KDM5A and H3K4me23, offering a new scaffold for optimizing KDM5A-targeted drugs. | The screening of imidazopyridine-analogs of zolpidem led to the discovery of O4I3, a novel chemical inhibitor of KDM5A. | O4I3 generates and sustains patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells in vitro.606 Additionally, TK-129, a pyrazole-based KDM5B inhibitor, is applied in treating cardiovascular diseases.607 High-throughput screening technology has facilitated the identification of PBIT, another novel KDM5B inhibitor. | Despite its promising attributes, PBIT exhibits unstable therapeutic effects across different cell lines, necessitating careful consideration of its application in treatment.608 Similarly, several pyrazole derivatives that inhibit KDM5B have been recognized, with several demonstrating potent activity in cells, suggesting new therapeutic strategies.609 Furthermore, Iida et al.610 designed a selective KDM5C inhibitor with a triazole scaffold and subsequently synthesized a KDM5C degrader using PROTAC techniques. | This selective degrader shows enhanced inhibitory effects on prostate cancer cell lines compared to its prodrug, thus expanding the possibilities for anticancer agent design. | KDM6 inhibitors The KDM6 subfamily has gained attention as a therapeutic target for various diseases. | GSK-J1 and GSK-J4 are two well-studied classical inhibitors of KDM6B, showing significant potential in treating autoimmune diseases, metabolic disorders, and tumors, and enhancing the effectiveness of traditional antitumor agents.611614 Using optimized delivery systems for GSK-J1 has further advanced the development of effective in vivo strategies.615 Beyond these compounds, novel inhibitors have been introduced. | For instance, KDOBA67, a hydroxyl derivative of GSK-J4, demonstrates favorable cell permeability in chordoma cell lines and inhibits the progression of chordoma.616 Employing a virtual fragment screening approach, Giordano et al.617 identified a series of benzoxazole scaffold compounds that bind to the KDM6B subfamily with high affinity, showing therapeutic promise in melanoma cell lines. | Zhang et al.618 developed a simple capillary electrophoresis method for screening KDM6B inhibitors, leading to the identification of salvianic acid A and puerarin 6-O-xyloside as effective agents. | Additionally, Jones et al.619 used computational methods to develop an optimized peptide derived from the H3 C-terminus, which may enhance selectivity when linked with known inhibitors. | LSD1 inhibitors Extensive research has been conducted on the biological and pathological functions of LSD1 and its inhibitors. | Compared to other KDM subfamilies, LSD1 inhibitors have seen significant advances.620 Currently, several LSD1 inhibitors such as tranylcypromine (TCP), ORY1001 (ladademstat), ORY2001, GSK2879552, IMG-7289 (bomedemstat), INCB059872, SP2577 (seclidemstat), CC-90011 (pulrodemstat), 4SC202 (domatinostat), JBI802, TAK-418, LH1802, and SYHA1807, are undergoing clinical trials. | TCP, an irreversible inhibitor, is being used in clinical practice among patients with AML and MDS, showing promising effects either alone or in combination with all-trans-retinoic acid in phase III clinical trials, with overall response rates exceeding 20.621,622 Building on TCPs structure, novel inhibitors like ORY-1001, ORY-2001, GSK-2879552, INCB059872, and IMG-7289 have been developed, which also bind irreversibly to LSD1.623 These advancements have broadened the spectrum of treatable diseases with LSD1 inhibitors. | SP-2577 and CC-9001 are reversible LSD1 inhibitors,632 which, compared to their irreversible counterparts, exhibit enhanced safety profiles and have been extensively studied in both solid tumors and hematological malignancies.633,634 Domatinostat and JBI-802, dual inhibitors targeting LSD1 and HDAC, selectively interact with class I HDAC isoenzymes and HDAC6, respectively.620 Although promising antitumor effects have been observed in cancer cell lines, the therapeutic potential of domatinostat requires further exploration due to its unfavorable toxicity.424,635 TAK-418, a novel LSD1 inhibitor noted for its effective brain penetration, is considered a potential treatment for central nervous system disorders.636,637 The administration of TAK-418 was well tolerated by healthy volunteers in a phase I clinical trial, laying a solid foundation for further investigation.638 LH-1802 and SYHA1807, novel inhibitors, are currently under clinical trial evaluation for metastatic prostate cancer and small-cell lung cancer, respectively (NCT03678025, NCT04404543). | The encouraging outcomes from these clinical-stage applications have spurred greater interest in the development of LSD1 inhibitors, with ongoing efforts to discover effective and tolerable agents. | Targeting the reader of histone methylation: reader domains The identification of histone lysine and arginine methylation is attributed to proteins possessing malignant brain tumor (MBT) domains, chromodomains, Tudor domains, proline-tryptophan-tryptophan-proline (PWWP) domains, PHD fingers, and WD40 repeat (WDR) domains.639 Notably, enzymes that serve as writers or erasers for histone methylation may also contain these reader modules, such as PHD fingers and Tudor domains, aiding in recognizing residues they catalyze.640 Although numerous inhibitors targeting reader domains have been discovered, nearly half of these originate from structure-based virtual screenings and lack in vivo evaluation of their inhibitory effects and therapeutic activity.641 Encouragingly, MAK683, an inhibitor targeting EEDa representative histone methylation reader containing the WDR domainhas entered clinical trials.642 Currently, MAK683 is in a phase I clinical trial for treating diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (NCT02900651). | Inspired by this milestone, many potent and selective inhibitors of EDD and other molecules targeting reader domain proteins are expected to advance into clinical trials as promising therapeutic strategies. | This function of METTL3, the most extensively studied m6A writer, has been linked to the development of various pathologies, notably various tumors.644 Recent research has highlighted a range of inhibitors and agonists targeting METTL3, with several epigenetic drugs demonstrating promising efficacy both in vitro and in vivo, thus reinforcing the significance of METTL3 regulation in disease pathology and its potential as a therapeutic target. | METTL3 inhibitors The study of METTL3 inhibitors has attracted increasing attention due to their diverse roles in regulating gene expression across different diseases. | These inhibitors are categorized into competitive and allosteric inhibitors and gene expression suppressors, each leveraging distinct mechanisms of action. | SAM analog is the dominant part of the competitive inhibitors, initially developed based on a fulfilled screening of compounds containing the adenosine moiety (the fragment responsible for the combination with METTL3 at the binding sites for SAM). | In 2020, Bedi et al.645 performed a series of docking studies on over 4000 adenosine-moiety compounds, identifying seven molecules with potential binding affinity to METTL3; however, their inhibitory effects in vivo were minimal. | Similarly, Moroz-Omori et al.646 and Dolbois et al.647 reported on adenine-based libraries, identifying UZH1a and UZH2 as compounds that occupy the catalytic pocket of METTL3, suggesting their role as potential competitive inhibitors in vitro. | Cpd-564, an METTL3 inhibitor identified from ChemDiv and MCE screening libraries, has shown significant reno-protective effects in mouse models of acute kidney injury induced by cisplatin and ischemia-reperfusion.648 Coptisine chloride, identified via molecular docking-based virtual screening from the Vitas-M chemical library, displayed high affinity to METTL3, exerting competitive inhibitory effects by occupying the SAM binding pocket.649 STM2457 and STM3006 are novel small molecules that bind non-covalently to the catalytic center of METTL3, reducing its enzymatic activity.650,651 Specifically, STM2457 has demonstrated promising antitumor effects and tolerability in mouse models, improving drug resistance to chemotherapy.650,652654 In comparison, although STM3006 exhibits enhanced cellular potency, its in vivo efficacy is constrained by its shorter half-life.651 In 2023, STC-15, an oral inhibitor optimized from STM2457, became the first and the only RNA m6A target drug to be applied in phase I clinical trials (NCT05584111). | These were synthesized by integrating chemical fragments from the most effective inhibitors, resulting in molecules with selectivity and binding affinities surpassing those of STM2457, the only commercially available METTL3 inhibitor.655 This advancement not only underscores the potential of METTL3 as a therapeutic target but also guides future drug design. | Additionally, several natural products with METTL3-inhibitory capabilities have been identified. | Quercetin, known as a DNMT inhibitor, has been found to interact with the adenosine moiety pocket in METTL3, forming a stable complex that reduces its catalytic activity.656 This interaction decreases METTL3 hyperactivation and lowers m6A levels in protein kinase D2 mRNA, improving insulin sensitivity under palmitic acid stimulationa benefit in hyperinsulinemia conditions.657 Other natural compounds like berberine and curcumin, also noted for DNMTHDAC inhibition, have shown METTL3 inhibitory activity, though their mechanisms require further clarification.658,659 Moreover, molecules F039-0002 and 7460-0250 have been designed to target METTL3s catalytic pocket, showing potential in treating inflammatory bowel disease.660 Several candidates identified through silico analysis of South African natural productsSANCDB0370, SANCDB0867, and SANCDB1033also exhibit METTL3 inhibitory properties, with further validation needed.661 More recently, Li et al.662 designed a stapled peptide inhibitor, RSM3, targeting the PPI at the METTL3-METTL14 interface. | This inhibitor offers a unique approach compared to other small-molecule competitive inhibitors, providing a novel avenue for therapeutic intervention. | Allosteric inhibitors prevent METTL314-dependent m6A methylation in a non-competitive manner. | To date, three allosteric inhibitors have been identified. | The first two allosteric inhibitors are CDIBA and CDIBA-43n, which initially function as cytosolic phospholipase A2 inhibitors preventing inflammation. | They show an inhibitory effect in the presence of METTL314 complex, instead of separate METTL3 and METTL14 subunits.663 The third compound, eltrombopag (previously mentioned as a TET agonist), is recently reported to bind with the METTL3 subunit at an allosteric site and has shown potential in treating AML.663,664 Metformin, traditionally used as a first-line treatment for T2DM, has recently been found to inhibit METTL3 expression, possibly contributing to its beneficial effects in patients with malignant tumors.665 The role of metformin in inhibiting METTL3 expression, at the post-transcriptional level, in breast tumors, is first reported in breast cancer.666 Subsequently, the application of metformin is also found to inhibit METTL3 expression at the transcriptional level, mediated by the recruitment of DNMT.667 This dual action of metformin, combined with chemotherapy, offers potential benefits for patients resistant to traditional chemotherapy, potentially mitigating poor prognoses.667,668 Given its safety profile, metformin is a promising candidate as an epigenetic drug targeting METTL3. | METTL3 agonists While research has predominantly focused on METTL3 inhibitors, there is also interest in agonists, given their potential benefits in DNA damage repair, tumor therapies, and regenerative medicine.669672 In 2019, Selberg et al.673 predicted interactions between four small-molecule ligands with METTL3 involving piperidine and piperazine rings, similar to SAMs binding. | These interactions enhanced cell viability and promoted proliferation, although differing onset times among the compounds suggest the need for further development of more effective METTL3 complex activators.673 Melatonin seems to act as an agonist of METTL3. | FTO is primarily involved in energy homeostasis, demethylating m6A in various RNA species, including cellular mRNA, which impacts multiple biological processes.676 ALKBH5 not only demethylates m6A-marked mRNA but also m6A-marked single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), influencing oncogenic or tumor-suppressive activities.677 Over the years, numerous small molecules targeting these m6A writers have been identified and designed, showing promising therapeutic efficacy in vitro and in vivo and advancing the development of epigenetic drugs. | FTO inhibitors Current strategies for developing FTO inhibitors are multifaceted. | Based on the spatial structure of FTO, competitive or non-competitive inhibitors that bind to FTO covalently or non-covalently have been developed. | With a deeper understanding of FTO functionality, metabolites in vivo possibly related to FTO have been identified, represented by D-2-HG, a metabolite produced by mutant IDH.678 Furthermore, exploring the mechanisms underlying medical agents that treat FTO-related diseases provides a theoretical foundation for drug discovery.679 Subsequently, optimizing the molecular structures of these initially detected compounds will contribute to the development of FTO inhibitors with high selectivity and inhibitory effects, providing promise for the clinical application of FTO inhibitors in the future. | Here, we summarize the typical drugs that inhibit FTO, which are the foundation for developing novel inhibitors through constant iterations. | In 2012, the first FTO inhibitor, rhein, was identified. | Rhein impairs FTO activity by disrupting its interaction with ssDNA at the catalytic domain.680 Although rhein increases m6A levels in vitro, its weak selectivity and low inhibitory efficacy have limited its clinical potential, highlighting the need for more effective FTO inhibitors.680 New FTO inhibitors need to be designed to overcome these drawbacks. | Meclofenamic acid (MA), an FDA-approved nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, binds selectively to similar sites on FTO.681 MA and its prodrug, MA2, have shown promising results in reversing tumor progression and enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs, significantly prolonging survival.681,682 Inspired by MA, various compounds have been developed, such as the fluorescein derivative FL1, which retains the benzyl carboxylic acid structure critical for interaction with FTO. | The complex formed between FTO and FL1 inhibits the enzymes activity and facilitates the study of FTO-related signaling pathways through fluorescein labeling.683 Other optimization molecules include GNPIPP12-MA,684 13a,685 FB23FB23-2,686 Dac-51Dac-85,687 ZLD115,688 and FTO-02FTO-04FTO-43.689,690 These compounds significantly improve MA in inhibitory activity, cell permeability, and biosafety while reducing off-target effects and potential resistance. | Another similar mechanism inhibitor is diacerein, a structural analog of rhein, which has shown antitumor effects in breast cell lines.691 In addition to interfering with the interaction between ssDNA and FTO, inhibitors of this enzyme also compete with cofactors such as α-KG and iron(II). | For instance, fumarate hydrazide 2 and compounds with the aminohydroxyfuranone core exemplify this approach.692,693 Furthermore, the discovery of N-CDPCB, a competitive inhibitor that binds to non-conserved fragments of FTO, provides novel insights into the development of inhibitory agents. | Mechanistically, compounds like benzene-1,3-diol and 4-Cl-1,3-diol are crucial in mediating and enhancing the specific interaction between FTO and N-CDPCB.694 Additional potential inhibitors, such as CHTB and radicicol, have been identified through virtual screening; these compounds have similar structures.695,696 However, related evidence is lacking to exhibit their efficacy. | Clausine E, another FTO inhibitor, targets the enzymes hydrophobic cavity, exhibiting antitumor activity.698 These ongoing discoveries provide a deeper understanding of the diverse structures of molecules interacting with FTO and their mechanisms of action, promoting large-scale virtual screenings to identify more potential inhibitors. | For example, mupirocin, entacapone, compounds 18,077 and 18,079, several quinolone derivatives, and a series of 1,2,3-triazole analogs have been identified as potential FTO inhibitors.699703 Notably, quinolone derivatives and their antitumor properties have shown the potential to improve symptoms in neurodegenerative diseases by inhibiting FTO activity.702 These findings broaden the potential clinical applications of FTO inhibitors. | FTO agonists Recent studies have identified that certain tricyclic antidepressants, such as imipramine and amitriptyline, exert their antidepressant effects by activating FTO in N2a cells.704 This emerging area of research highlights the potential therapeutic benefits of FTO activators and calls for more attention to their development and evaluation. | ALKBH5 inhibitors The RNA demethylase ALKBH5 is recognized as a pro-oncogene, playing a vital role in the post-transcriptional regulation of various targets in cancer biology.677 Interest in targeting ALKBH5 for therapeutic purposes has significantly increased. | We classify the identified ALKBH5 inhibitors into three main categories based on their mechanisms of action. | The first category comprises typical competitive inhibitors that compete with cofactors for binding sites. | These agents consist of IOX1 (also known as a TETKDM inhibitor), MV1035, and Ena21, which exhibit the therapeutic potential of targeting ALKBH5 in antitumor therapies.705707 Compounds that non-covalently interact with the active pocket of ALKBH5 are classified as the second group. | Through structure-based virtual screening and optimization, the current compounds include DDO-2728, 2-((1-hydroxy-2-oxo-2-phenylethyl)thio)acetic acid, and 4-((furan-2-ylmethyl)amino)tetrahydropyridazine-3,6-dione.708,709 The third category includes molecules that bind to the m6A-binding pocket of ALKBH5, directly disrupting the interaction between the enzyme and its substrates. | For instance, compounds 20 m and TD19 are representative of this type.710,711 Some compounds still exist whose potential mechanisms for inhibiting ALKBH5 have not been elucidated, such as ALK-04, Ena15, ZINC78774792, and ZINC00546946, although their antiproliferative effects have been revealed in vitro and in vivo.707,712,713 In brief, the continued development and in-depth research into ALKBH5 inhibitors hold significant potential for disease treatment, necessitating further efforts. | IGF2BP inhibitors Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding proteins (IGF2BPs) are newly identified m6A readers that enhance the stability and maintenance of their target mRNAs.714 IGF2BP plays an oncogenic role in various cancers, making its inhibition a promising strategy for antitumor therapy.715 Six IGF2BP inhibitors have been developed, demonstrating antitumor effects by disrupting IGF2BP-RNA interactions. | BTYNB, the first identified IGF2BP1 inhibitor, suppresses melanoma and ovarian cancer cell proliferation by blocking IGF2BP1s interaction with c-Myc mRNA.716 BTYNBs therapeutic effects are being studied across various tumor models, including esophageal squamous carcinoma,717 neuroblastoma,718 and cholangiocarcinoma.719 CWI1-2 and JX5 are novel IGF2BP2 inhibitors with antileukemic activities that inactivate the Notch1 signaling pathway. | In hepatocellular carcinoma mouse models, it modifies IGF2BP1s configuration, reducing its efficacy.722 Another compound, 7773, specifically disrupts the IGF2BP1-Kras mRNA interaction, effectively inhibiting IGF2BP1s pro-oncogenic activity.723 Isoliquiritigenin is the only small molecule identified targeting IGF2BP3.724 Derived from the Chinese herb licorice, it downregulates IGF2BP3 expression, showing promise in treating non-small cell lung cancer.724 YTH domain family inhibitors YTH domain family (YTHDF) comprises a group of readers featuring a YTH domain at the C-terminus. | This domain forms a hydrophobic pocket essential for recognizing m6A modifications.725 Elevated levels of YTHDF proteins have been associated with the progression of various cancers.726 Conversely, reducing these proteins can synergistically enhance the effectiveness of ionizing radiation and anti-PD-L1 therapies in reducing cancer burdens.727,728 This underscores the potential of YTHDF inhibitors as a promising direction for improving antitumor treatments. | The binding sites between YTHDF proteins and m6A modifications are primary targets for most YTHDF inhibitors.729 The successful elucidation of the crystallographic structures of the YTH domains in YTHDF proteins has provided critical opportunities for drug design.730 High-throughput screening technology has identified three small moleculesebselen, DC-Y13, and DC-Y13-27as effective YTHDF inhibitors.727,731 Ebselen targets YTHDF1 and YTHDF2, either covalently or non-covalently binding to the YTH domain.731 DC-Y13 and DC-Y13-27, particularly the latter, act as selective inhibitors of YTHDF2, offering therapeutic benefits.727 Additionally, studies have shown that disrupting O-GlcNAcylation of YTHDF proteins can also decrease their stability and enzymatic activities, providing new avenues for identifying YTH-inhibiting small molecules.732,733 Epigenetics-targeted drugs and chromatin remodeling SWISNF complexes are intricate multimeric structures composed of diverse, variable subunits that play distinct roles, emphasizing the importance of personalized characteristics and frequent mutations in these subunits in various human diseases. | Recently, the design of small molecules targeting different components of the SWISNF complex has expanded, yielding numerous potential therapeutic interventions. | Those that have progressed to clinical trials are detailed in Table 6.Table 6Summary of chromatin

myelodysplastic syndrome, NSCLC non-small cell lung cancer, PROTAC proteolysis-targeting chimeras, SMARCA4 SWISNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin A4 The active DNA-dependent ATPase A domain inhibitor (ADAADi) was the first discovered inhibitor targeting the SWISNF complex. | It was identified during studies on mammalian cell resistance to certain antibiotics in vitro.734 ADAADi binds to specific motifs in the enzyme complex, inducing conformational changes that inhibit SWI2SNF2s catalytic activities.734 Currently, ADAADi shows promising therapeutic effects in prostate cancer in preclinical studies, laying the groundwork for further development of SWISNF-targeted epigenetic drugs.735 Research has also focused on specific inhibitors targeting the SWISNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin A4 (SMARCA4) and its paralog SMARCA2, which are DNA-stimulated ATPases within the SWISNF complexes. | Papillon et al.738 reported the earliest selective allosteric inhibitors of the SMARCA4SMARCA2 subunits, with confirmed effects on pediatric H3K27M diffuse midline glioma and AML in both in vivo and in vitro settings.739,740 FHD-286, a novel orally bioavailable SMARCA4SMARCA2 allosteric inhibitor, has shown preclinical efficacy. | Combined treatment with FHD-286 and other epigenetic drugs, such as decitabine, BET inhibitors, and menin inhibitors, has demonstrated synergistic effects in reducing AML burden without significant toxicity.741 Notably, FHD-286 has entered clinical development for treating various malignant tumors, including metastatic uveal melanoma (NCT04879017) and several malignant hematological disorders (NCT04891757). | An alternative approach to inhibiting SMARCA4SMARCA2 involves using specific inhibitors that target their BDs. This strategy extends to other BD-containing proteins within the SWISNF complexes, such as polybromo-1 (PBRM1), BD containing 7 (BRD7), and BRD9, also considered promising targets for epigenetic drug development. | Notably, SMARCA4SMARCA2 and BRD9BRD7 each contain one BD, whereas PBRM1 contains six tandem BDs, providing numerous potential interaction points for inhibitors.742 Current research primarily focuses on inhibitors for family VIII BD in SMARCA4SMARCA2 and PBRM1, with four major classes of inhibitors reported: salicylic acid fragment hits such as PFI-3;743745 aminopyridazines represented by GNE-064;746 quinazolinones represented by LM146,747,748 and dihydroquinazolinones represented by compound16 and GNE-235.749,750 These inhibitors are categorized as either pan-inhibitors, affecting multiple proteins, or selective inhibitors, targeting specific proteins. | PFI-3, its analogs, and GNE-064 are pan-inhibitors, whereas LM146 shows a higher affinity for SMARCA2, and compound16 and GNE-235 are selective for PBRM1. | The therapeutic applications of these inhibitors, particularly the pan-inhibitors, have been extensively studied in various diseases.751755 However, the efficacy of PFI-3 as a standalone treatment for malignancies has been less satisfactory. | The application of compound16, on the other hand, demonstrates promising therapeutic effects in PBRM1-dependent prostate cancer, suggesting its potential as a foundational treatment for PBRM1-driven cancers.749 As for the other molecules, though their binding ability and inhibitory effects have been validated at the molecular level, sufficient evidence is still lacking in vivo or in vitro to demonstrate their clinical value. | Furthermore, targeting family IV BD of BRD9 and BRD7 has led to the development of many selective inhibitors. | Current research includes inhibitors like BI-7271,756 BI-7273,756 BI-9564,756 I-BRD9,757 iBRD9,758 GNE-375,759 and newly identified inhibitors developed through integrated computational approaches.760 Selective inhibitors for BRD7, such as 1-78 and 2-77,761 and molecules like LP99, TP-472, 4-acylpyrroles, and GSK6776, which inhibit both BRD9 and BRD7, are being evaluated for their therapeutic effects in various pathologies.762765 PROTAC technology plays a significant role in developing SWISNF inhibitors, with novel agents such as AU-24118 and AU-15330 being tested in preclinical studies and clinical trials. | AU-24118 and AU-15330 are degraders targeting family VIII BD in SMARCA4SMARCA2 and PBRM1, which are valuable tools in castration-resistant prostate cancer treatment.766,767 AU-24118 has shown promise in inducing tumor regression at therapeutic doses.766 However, long-term treatment at high doses can lead to mutations in the BD and overexpression of ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1), which contributes to drug resistance development.766 Combining these treatments with ABCB1 inhibitors could potentially mitigate resistance to SMARCA4SMARCA2 inhibitors in vivo. | Additionally, applying PROTACs to previously reported inhibitors can enhance their selectivity and reduce off-target effects. | For instance, the linkage of BI-7273 with an E3 ubiquitin ligase has led to the design of dBRD9-A, the first BRD9-directed degrader, which is undergoing optimization.768,769 The current focus on dBRD9-A, which is being tested for its efficacy in AML, MM, and interferon-induced inflammation in animal models, highlights its potential as a promising therapeutic for both tumor and non-tumor conditions.768,770,771 Additional PROTACs-based SWISNF inhibitors, such as those derived from dihydropyrrolo-quinazolin scaffolds (targeting SMARCA4, SMARCA2, and PBRM1),747 A947 (targeting SMARCA2),772 VZ-185 (targeting BRD9 and BRD7),773 CFT8634 as well as FHD-609 (targeting BRD9), further illustrate the breadth of ongoing research.774 Notably, FHD-609 have recently advanced to clinical trials for synovial sarcoma (NCT04965753), underscoring the critical role of drug development targeting mutations in SWISNF complexes. | Herein, we summarize the emerging technologies for ncRNA-targeted agent development, aiming at supplementing the current understanding of drug design.Table 7Summary of non-coding RNA drugs for different diseases in clinical

cell lung cancer, RCC renal cell carcinoma, SCLC small cell lung cancer Significant advancements in molecular editing and delivery systems have bolstered the clinical viability of these innovative ncRNA-targeted therapies.778,779 One pivotal development has been the chemical modification of synthetic nucleic acids to enhance their stability and delivery efficiency. | The initial focus on replacing phosphodiester bonds with phosphorothioate has been a cornerstone in numerous FDA-approved oligonucleotide therapies,780 although concerns about inflammation and toxicity in vivo have prompted research into alternative modifications for RNA-targeted based on RNAi.781 Over the years, various modification strategies have emerged, including those based on 2-O-methyl, 2-O-methoxyethyl, 2-fluoro, and n-acetylgalactosaminyl, aiming to preserve the therapeutic attributes of nucleic acids while enhancing their stability.782 Locked nucleic acids (LNAs) represent a notable innovation, linking the 2 and 4 carbons of ribose rings with methylene bridges, thus improving hybridization affinity and resistance to nucleases.783 Cobomarsen, an LNA-based inhibitor targeting miR-155, exemplifies this technologys potential, having shown promising results in preclinical studies for hematological malignancies and solid tumors and exhibiting positive effects in mycosis fungoides patients.784788 In addition, the therapeutic efficacy of cobomarsen has been further validated in patients with mycosis fungoides, indicating well-tolerated and positive clinical potentials (NCT03713320). | However, transitioning from a potent molecular probe to a viable therapeutic agent involves rigorous in vivo evaluation to confirm their inhibitory effects and therapeutic potential. | This step is crucial as it determines whether these compounds can be safely and effectively used in clinical settings.811,812 These small molecules are potent probes to detect the localization and function of targeted enzymes, and their potential for medical use needs confirmation. | Many drugs targeting epigenetic enzymes exhibit pan-inhibitory effects, leading to significant off-target effects and adverse reactions, particularly when the drugs indiscriminately affect multiple members of an enzyme family.408 This necessitates the development of more selective inhibitors that specifically target single proteins or subfamilies of proteins. | Research has shown that the activation of enhanced WinglessIntegrated (Wnt)β-catenin signaling contributes to developing resistance to BET inhibitors in leukemia cells. | However, inhibition of this pathway helps rescue drug sensitivity in vitro and in vivo.818,819 Furthermore, enhanced activity of the protein kinase B (AKT)mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway is also responsible for drug resistance to BET inhibitors in prostate cancer.820 In another study on HDAC resistance in solid tumors, the potential role of the activation of some kinases and downstream pathways was also reported.821 Additionally, altered TME may be one of the culprits in promoting drug resistance. | Tumor-associated macrophage (TAM), a pivotal mediator in inducing tumor cells to develop resistance to traditional antitumor therapies, has recently been proposed to be involved in the occurrence of epigenetic drug resistance.822,823 A 2020 study on triple-negative breast cancer reported that interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10 derived from TAM activated STAT3 signaling in tumor cells, conferring them with drug resistance to BET inhibitors.823 Additionally, these findings pave a theoretical foundation for the combination of epigenetics-targeted drugs and other pharmaceutical molecules to optimize their long-term efficacy.824 The relationship between drug resistance to epigenetic agents and mutations in certain genes is observed in tumor cells, especially in the case of applying EZH2 and IDH inhibitors.59,825,826 Based on this idea, the loss-of-function mutation of specific genes by CRISPRCas techniques may provide better platforms for coping with drug resistance. | 5, emphasize the synergy between these agents and other therapeutic modalities such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, kinase inhibitors, and immunotherapy. | This integration promotes precision medicine and personalized treatment strategies and enhances the overall effectiveness of cancer therapies.827,828 Furthermore, developing epigenetic degraders, which can hydrolyze targeted proteins, complements the inhibitory functions of traditional epigenetic drugs.829 Notably, the swift advancement of sequencing technology has empowered the detection of epigenetic irregularities with growing efficacy, substantially enhancing the integration of epigenetics into personalized medicine.Fig. | Further, epigenetic degraders based on PROTAC or other techniques responsible for TPD help supplement the catalytic function of epigenetic inhibitors. | The benefits of these combinations can be categorized into two primary aspects: Epigenetic drugs can synergize with other cancer therapies by modulating the metabolic and pathological characteristics of cancer cells, immune cells, and stromal cells within the TME.830 Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), which target immune checkpoint proteins (ICPs), such as PD-L1, PD-1, and CTLA-4, show significant potential, their effectiveness may be limited by factors such as insufficient antigen presentation and suboptimal T cell responses in the TME.831,832 Epigenetic modifications can enhance the expression of tumor antigens and ICPs, overcoming these limitations. | Chemoresistance often correlates with changes in DNA methylation and histone acetylation, among other epigenetic characteristics.139,836,837 Combining chemotherapeutic agents with epigenetic drugs has become an important strategy to address resistance,838,839 also helping to mitigate chemotherapy-related side effects.840,841 Additionally, reversing epigenetic alterations in chemoresistant tumor cells can restore their sensitivity to conventional therapies, offering a renewed opportunity for treatment.842 In the context of targeted therapy, inhibitors of mutant kinases initially provide rapid benefits but often lead to the development of resistance over time.843 The potential of epigenetic treatments, particularly HDAC and DNMT inhibitors, to reverse such resistance is currently being explored.844,845 The development of dual inhibitors, like CUDC907, CUDC101, and 4SC-202, shows promising results in overcoming resistance in kinase-driven cancers and warrants further investigation.846 For hormone-dependent cancers, such as estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer and androgen receptor-positive prostate cancer, endocrine therapy remains a crucial treatment option.847 However, epigenetic alterations can lead to resistance during endocrine therapy.848,849 Targeting these epigenetic changes can help sustain the effectiveness of endocrine therapies and reduce the proliferation of cancer cells.848,850 At present, various combination regimens based on HMA and traditional anticancer drugs have entered clinical trials, gaining the potential to become an alternative for patients with certain diseases. | For example, the combination of the oral B-cell leukemialymphoma 2 inhibitor venetoclax with HMAs has become a standard regimen among patients with AML or MDS who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. | In May 2022, the combination of ivosidenib, an IDH1 inhibitor, and azacitidine was approved by the FDA for older patients with newly diagnosed IDH1-mutated AML.240 Other drugs being combined with HMAs include HDAC inhibitors, polo-like kinase 1 inhibitors, T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-3 antibodies, and PD-L1 antibodies.857860 These combinations are currently under evaluation in ongoing registrational clinical trials across different stages, with promising results anticipated for updating clinical strategies. | They consist of a ligand for targeted proteins, a ligand for E3 ubiquitin ligase, such as Von Hippel-Lindau and Cereblon (CRBN), and a linker connecting the two ligands.867 Many degraders targeting diverse epigenetic enzymes have been developed, including the newly designed or derived from the optimization of known selective inhibitors.868,869 This technology has led to the creation of various degraders targeting a wide range of epigenetic enzymes, enhancing their potency, duration of action, safety profile, and ability to counteract resistance mechanisms compared to conventional inhibitors.867869 For instance, dBET1, derived from the BRD inhibitor JQ-1, was the first PROTAC-based degrader targeting BET proteins. | Antibody-PROTACs have been developed for breast cancer cells overexpressing human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and prostate cancer cells expressing six transmembrane epithelial antigens of the prostate 1, showing enhanced degradation specificity in these cell types.871,872 Compared with general degradation agents, these small molecules present the preferential degradation of target proteins in specific cell lines. | This demonstrates their potential as effective medical tools for treating various diseases.879 Introduced in 2011, HyT technology uses small molecules composed of a targeted protein ligand, a hydrophobic tag, and a linker. | Unlike PROTACs that often target the ubiquitin-proteasome system, HyT-based degraders work by increasing the hydrophobicity of the target protein, facilitating its degradation.880 MS1943, an EZH2 HyT degrader, illustrates this technologys effectiveness.881 It has shown superior inhibitory effects on tumor cell lines and greater selectivity towards cancer cells over normal cells, demonstrating significant tumor suppression and good tolerance in mouse models.881 Other HyT-based degraders are also developed, including those targeting HDAC and YEATS domain readers, providing therapeutic strategies for diseases caused by mutations or dysfunction in specific proteins.882884 Further development of HyT-based degraders is ongoing, with efforts to improve their bioavailability and therapeutic effects in vivo by exploring new hydrophobic labels.885 MG differs fundamentally from PROTACs and other degraders by inducing degradation through promoting tight binding between the target protein and proteasome components, leading to the proteins subsequent degradation.886,887 A notable example is the MG-based degrader DD-1-073, targeting HDAC13, derived from SAHA (a known HDAC inhibitor). | These novel small molecules offer promising therapeutic alternatives, but several challenges and limitations must be addressed to enhance their clinical applicability and effectiveness. | These results are imperative for designing and developing agonists and inhibitors of epigenetic enzymes with enhanced selectivity and bioactivity.","Conrad Waddington (PER)"

PAPA NONOate, a NO donor, can oxidize metallothionein-sulfur (Liu et al., 2000); DL-Buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine serves as an inhibitor of GSH synthesis (Steinebach and Wolterbeek, 1994). | These compounds can be employed to disrupt the Cu reservation mediated by GSH-metallothionein so that dysfunction Cu homeostasis. | 3.1.4 Cu chaperones ATOX1, CCS, COX17 carry intracellular Cu(I) to nucleus, Golgi apparatus, SOD, mitochondria, respectively and modulate normal metabolic activities, thereby inhibition of Cu chaperones will reduce Cu trafficking, another approach to aggravate Cu accumulation via small molecule compounds (Chen et al., 2022). | reported a small molecule DC_AC50, inhibitor of ATOX1 and CCS, disrupted intracellular Cu transport and triggered oxidative stress in cancer cells (Wang et al., 2015). | Thus DC_AC50 is also a potential cuproptosis inducer to mediate Cu-dependent cell death, but the specific COX17 inhibitor awaits further exploration. | 3.2 Small molecule compounds to induce cuproptosis by targeting mitochondrial respiration and TCA cycle Tsvetkov P et al. | The small molecule compounds that suppress glycolysis and favor OXPHOS may thus be promising tools for killing cells sensitive to cuproptosis. | Phloretin (glucose transporter (GLUT) inhibitor) (Zhang et al., 2024), PX-478 (hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) inhibitor) (Li et al., 2024), 2-deoxy-D-glucose (hexokinase inhibitor) (Yang et al., 2023), galactose (Tsvetkov et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2023), these glycolysis inhibitors would have been taken into therapeutic consideration for cancer sensitive to cuproptosis through driving reprogramming of TCA cycle and OXPHOS. | 4 Cuproptosis inhibitors The eligible cuproptosis inhibitors should antagonize the cell death effects of Cu overload and alleviate the cellular damages induced by cuproptosis including oxidative stress, mitochondrial respiration dysfunction and UPS inhibition. | Tsvetkov and colleagues verified that the cytotoxicity of Cu ionophore was eliminated by Cu chelator (tetrathiomolybdate) rather than other pathway inhibitors including Z-VAD-FMK, Boc-D-FMK (apoptosis), ferrostatin-1 (ferroptosis) and necrostatin-1 (necroptosis), whereas other metal chelators such as deferoxamine mesylate and TPEN had no effect on the killing capacity induced by Cu ionophore (Tsvetkov et al., 2022). | Mechanically, the Cu cell death effects depended on mitochondrial respiration and TCA cycle, since treatment with mitochondrial antioxidants, fatty acids, mitochondrial function inhibitors induced distinct effects on Cu ionophore sensitivity; and furthermore treatment with electron transport chain complexes (ETC) inhibitors, mitochondrial pyruvate uptake inhibitors attenuated the cell death; treatment with mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP had no effect on Cu cytotoxicity (Tsvetkov et al., 2022). | The scientific and medical communities have continuously developed available drugs for the diseases in Cu overload, and the discovery of cuproptosis significantly accelerates the progress of cuproptosis inhibitors. | Based on the targets and metabolic pathways involved, like inducers, the cuproptosis inhibitors we collect can be similarly categorized into small molecule compounds, transcription factors and ncRNAs (Figure 5; Table 2). | FIGURE 5 The small molecule compounds, transcription factors and ncRNAs to suppress Cu-dependent cell death. | We have collected some small molecule compounds targeting Cu chelator ①, reservation ②, mitochondrial respiration and TCA cycle ③, oxidative stress ④, transcription factors targeting energy metabolism, membrane transporter, reservation ⑤ and ncRNA ⑥ targeting FDX1 to suppress Cu-dependent cell death. | TABLE 2 Display of cuproptosis inhibitors. | Small molecule compounds GSH Cu chelator Cu ions Oxidative stress Tsvetkov et al. | 4.1 Small molecule compounds to reduce intracellular Cu content by targeting Cu chelators and reservation 4.1.1 Cu chelators In contrast to ionophores delivering Cu ions to cells, Cu chelators are another type of Cu complexes that reduce intracellular Cu content and perturbate cuproptosis pathways. | et al., 2023); the synthesized 2,6-Pyridinedicarboxylic acid, 2,6-bis hydrazide and 3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylaldehyde rhodamine hydrazone bore the capacity to counter Cu ions to rescue the deposits of amyloid-beta peptide in Alzheimers disease model of Drosophila (Singh et al., 2013; Chauhan et al., 2022); captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor for hypertension, is reported to protect against free radical by chelation to Cu (Tamba and Torreggiani, 2000); other Cu chelators include LCC-12, a derivative of metformin with anti-inflammatory effects and curcumin, a naturally occurring polyphenol with anti-tumor activity (Solier et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2018). | Zinc acetate is one such notable small molecule compound developed for the treatment of Wilson disease, which induces the expression of metallothionein in intestinal cells to block Cu absorption and reduce Cu deposition in brain and liver, albeit initial gastric irritation in fewer patients (Munk et al., 2022). | However, there are rare small molecule compounds in response to facilitating GSH synthesis and metallothionein induction in the field of Cu reservation and cuproptosis to date, such compounds are awaiting further exploration. | 4.2 Small molecule compounds to inhibit cuproptosis by targeting mitochondrial respiration and TCA cycle According to the outcome of Tsvetkov et al., the cells with active mitochondrial respiration and high levels of lipoylated TCA enzymes were more sensitive to the Cu-dependent cell death; treatment with fatty acids, mitochondrial function inhibitors and mitochondrial antioxidants showed different degrees of influence on Cu cytotoxicity; notably ETC inhibitors and mitochondrial pyruvate uptake inhibitors retarded the cell death effects by Cu-ionophores (Tsvetkov et al., 2022). | Thereby the small molecule compounds that impair ETC and mitochondrial pyruvate uptake enable to inhibit cuproptosis by targeting mitochondrial respiration and TCA cycle. | The insecticide rotenone is an ETC I inhibitor that drives cell apoptosis via the induction of ROS in mitochondria (Kishore Kumar et al., 2017). | demonstrated that the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier inhibitor UK5099 elevated glycolytic enzymes and promoted glycolysis and lactate production (Wang et al., 2018). | Hence these ETC and mitochondrial pyruvate uptake inhibitors have the potential to reprogram the mitochondrial respiration and TCA cycle to glycolysis, which will induce the dynamic changes of cuproptosis-related genes and reduce the sensitivity to Cu stress. | 4.3 Small molecule compounds to alleviate cuproptosis by targeting oxidative stress In the study of Tsvetkov et al., although treatment with the oxidative stress inhibitor N-acetyl cysteine failed to abrogate the cell death mediated by elesclomol-Cu(II), excess ROS is one of the cell death effects generated by Cu Fenton reaction (Tsvetkov et al., 2022). | In addition to chelators reducing intracellular Cu content, we are looking for some small molecule compounds to alleviate the cellular damages of cuproptosis by reducing the ROS derived from Cu Fenton reaction. | These compounds can be considered for the potential treatment to alleviate Cu overload and toxicity by targeting oxidative stress. | So delivery of miRNA inhibitors reversing the ncRNA target effects on cuproptosis positive regulator devises novel therapeutic approach to carcinoma through the induction of cuproptosis, but it remains a big challenge. | Nowadays, the cuproptosis inducers and inhibitors have been continuously improved and employed for scientific studies and medical options, and in this study they are collected and categorized into small molecule compounds, transcription factors and ncRNAs, in terms of the key targets in cuproptosis metabolic pathways. | We pay more attention to small molecule compounds which influence the progress of Cu-induced cell death, rather than transcription factors, ncRNAs or other types of regulators, since they are more readily screened and dosed to produce therapeutic outcome than other types of candidates. | For inducers of cuproptosis, to raise intracellular Cu content, we collect some small molecule compounds targeting Cu ionophores: elesclomol, disulfiram, clioquinol, 8-quinolinol, schiff base, pyrithione, zinc metallochaperone, Cu(II)ATSMCu(II)GTSM, UM4118, they are capable of delivering Cu ions into cells; Cu membrane transporters: epigallocatechol gallate, β-elemene, CID 2011756, omeprazole, 6-hydroxydopamine hydrobromide, they can upregulate SLC31A1 expression or downregulate ATP7A7B expression to drive Cu deposition; Cu reservation: 6-hydroxydopamine hydrobromide, actinomycin D, PAPA NONOate, DL-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine, they enable to aggravate the release of intracellular Cu ions; Cu chaperones: DC_AC50, it has the ability to reduce Cu trafficking by inhibiting ATOX1 and CCS. | To enhance mitochondrial respiration and TCA cycle, the small molecule compounds phloretin, PX-478, 2-deoxy-D-glucose and galactose can be employed as glycolysis inhibitors to shift the energy metabolism to TCA cycle and OXPHOS. | The transcription factors ELF3, Sp1, ATF3SPI1, facilitating the expression of SLC31A1 and the ncRNAs LINC02362miR-18a-5p, facilitating the expression of FDX1 are accompanied to enhance the sensitivity to Cu stress beyond small molecule compounds (Figure 4; Table 1). | For inhibitors of cuproptosis, to reduce intracellular Cu content, we collect some small molecule compounds targeting Cu chelators: GSH, tetrathiomolybdate, bathocuproinedisulfonic acid, trientine, penicillamine, 2,6-Pyridinedicarboxylic acid, 2,6-bis hydrazide, 3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylaldehyde rhodamine hydrazone, captopril, LCC-12, curcumin, they are capable of chelating intracellular Cu ions; Cu reservation: Zinc acetate, it can elevate metallothionein level in intestinal cells. | To retard mitochondrial respiration and TCA cycle, the small molecule compounds rotenone, antimycin A, UK5099 can be employed as mitochondrial respiration inhibitors to shift the energy metabolism to glycolysis. | To recover oxidative homeostasis, the small molecule compounds coumarin, deferiprone, phenolic acids are helpful to eliminate the ROS derived from Cu Fenton reaction. | The transcription factors HIF-1α, facilitating hypoxia, MTF1, facilitating ATP7B and metallothionein expression and the ncRNA miR-21-5p, decreasing FDX1 expression are accompanied to reduce the sensitivity to Cu stress beyond small molecule compounds (Figure 5; Table 2). | The strategies to collect cuproptosis inducers originate from raising the intracellular Cu content and the intensity of mitochondrial respiration and TCA cycle, while the strategies to collect cuproptosis inhibitors originate from reducing intracellular Cu content, the intensity of mitochondrial respiration, TCA cycle, oxidative stress and UPS inhibition. | Importantly, the medical values of cuproptosis inducers and inhibitors are mainly concentrated in the treatment of genetic, neurodegenerative, cardiovascular and tumoral diseases, achieving by recovering normal Cu homeostasis, inducing Cu overload or deficiency. | But to date, we have not collected applicable small molecule compounds for the cuproptosis inhibitors that target Cu membrane transporters, Cu chaperones or UPS inhibition during Cu stress and they require further exploration. | It can be concluded from the studies that cuproptosis inducers and inhibitors have the potential to modulate Cu cell death effects relying on their composition and property, but the action mode may vary from distinct drug candidates and cell types. | Some compounds we collect have been applied for the clinical trials of Wilson disease such as tetrathiomolybdate (NCT00004339) (Brewer et al., 2006), trientine (NCT01472874) (Ala et al., 2015), penicillamine (Schilsky et al., 2022), Zinc acetate (NCT00212355) (Shimizu et al., 2010) and reduced Cu accumulation in liver and brain through complex and metallothionein chelation, respectively. | Hence, cuproptosis has attracted dramatic interests in providing a new avenue for medical options, and promising compounds that can modulate Cu-induced cell death in preclinical studies have been also collected and displayed in our study. | We should dedicate to improve the combination strategies so that the cuproptosis inducers and inhibitors we collect can provide better therapeutic approaches. | Therefore, nanocarriers selectively delivering cuproptosis inducers and inhibitors to the lesions can elevate precise therapeutic outcome and reduce toxicity for medical applications based on Cu cell death effects, but the composition, property, cell type of these delivery system, and further clinical trials still necessitate in-depth exploration. | In addition to the small molecule compounds, transcription factors and ncRNAs we collect in this study, we note that other types of cuproptosis-related molecules can also modulate Cu cell death effects. | Chiefly, small molecule compounds are strong candidates in regulating Cu-induced cell death owing to the suitable screen and administration routes. | The candidate compounds can be excavated from rounds of verification: bioinformatic analysis, molecular simulation and docking, interaction analysis. | In this study, we have collected kinds of cuproptosis inducers and inhibitors based on the key targets and metabolic pathways of Cu-induced cell death, but the combination strategy and drug carrier remain incompletely documented, which may thus be promising tools for curing patients with Cu homeostasis dysfunction. | Herein, we will keep our eye on Cu- and other metal elements-mediated cell death, particularly in the field of inducers and inhibitors, which are valuable for identifying cell death pathways, exploring disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets based on metal element dysfunction. | We mainly collect the small molecule compounds that induce or inhibit cuproptosis based on the key targets and metabolic pathways of Cu stress in this study, accompanied by relevant transcription factors and ncRNAs. They have the promising potential to be employed as inducers or inhibitors in the scientific studies and medical options of Cu homeostasis dysfunction. | Meanwhile the drug species, combination and delivery strategies of cuproptosis inducers or inhibitors also await further exploration.","C (MISC), T (MISC), Fe (MISC), S (MISC), HSP (MISC), C (MISC), C (MISC), C (MISC), Xie (PER), C (MISC), C (MISC), C (MISC)"

however, proBDNFinduced apoptosis of natural killer cells is mediated by SORT1 . | Of note, PLGplasmin that is generated by the action of PLAT (plasminogen activator, tissue type) is highly reduced in MS resulting in the reduction of the proteolytic conversion of proBDNF to BDNF. | In addition, SERPINE1tissue plasminogen inhibitor (serpin family E member 1) that reduces PLGplasmin is increased in MS . | Hence, BDNF activators could be a therapeutic potential in the management of MS. | T cells that reach the bloodstream of fingolimodtreated patients with MS may contribute to the neuroprotective effect of this therapy by increased secretion of BDNF . | Fingolimod has a neuroprotective effect against the aggregation of SNCA in PD by increasing the expression of BDNF in the dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra pars compacta in transgenic mice . | Thus, the neuroprotective effect of fingolimod against the development and progression of MS may be primarily through activation of the BDNF signaling pathway. | Hence, the neuroprotective effect of IFNB against the progression of MS is related to the immunomodulatory effect and augmentation of BDNF signaling. | Thus, the neuroprotective effect of ketamine against the progression of MS is linked to activation of BDNF signaling. | Different studies highlighted the point that the potential neuroprotective and antidepressant effects of antidepressant drugs are mediated by activating BDNF signaling . | These findings highlighted the fact that BDNF activators could be effective in the management of MS (Table 4). | TABLE 4 The potential role of BDNF activators in MS. | BDNF activators Findings References Fingolimod Promotes BDNF levels via MAPK signaling and inhibits NMDAmediated neurotoxicity in cultured neurons Glatiramer acetate A longitudinal study found that treatment with glatiramer acetate for 21 months increases the production of BDNF from peripheral immune cells in MS patients IFNB Attenuates neuronal apoptosis by increasing the expression of NTRK2 receptors and BDNF in rats Ketamine BDNF may be the key factor underlying antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of subanesthetic ketamine Antidepressant drugs Antidepressant drugs can enhance BDNF signaling, which is highly dysregulated in MS Ketogenic diet The ketogenic diet promotes BDNF expression in the rat hippocampus Physical exercise Physical exercise improves depressive symptoms by increasing the circulating BDNF level in patients with depression Taken together, BDNF signaling is deregulated in MS and correlates with the progression and severity of MS. | BDNF activators can ameliorate MS neuropathology by increasing brain and peripheral BDNF signaling, which has a neuroprotective effect against the development and progression of MS (Figure 4). | FIGURE 4 BDNF activators in MS: BDNF activators improve BDNF signaling, which inhibits MS neuropathology and associated neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. | BDNF has been extensively investigated, and it has emerged as an important regulator of synaptic plasticity, neuronal survival, and differentiation. | BDNF activators can ameliorate MS neuropathology by increasing brain and peripheral BDNF signaling which has a neuroprotective effect against the development and progression of MS.","ABS (ORG), ##D (MISC), CNS (LOC), BD (MISC), ##D (MISC), CNS (LOC), N (ORG), ##D (MISC), BD (MISC), ##D (MISC), MS (MISC), BD (MISC), MS (MISC), BD (MISC), AD Alzheimers (MISC), CIS (MISC), CNS (LOC), MR (MISC), Parkinsons (MISC), ##D (MISC)"

common targets between SJZD and PD were evaluated by KEGG pathway enrichment analysis (p 0.05 as the significant level). | To gain insight into the relationships between compounds with Degree 50 (Supplementary Table S2), targets, and the top 10 pathways, a compound-target-pathway network was created using Cytoscape 3.7.1, containing 123 nodes and 507 edges (Figure 7C). | (C) The compound-target-pathway network implying the mechanism of SJZD in PD treatment. | The green nodes represent the compounds, the red nodes represent the targets, and the yellow nodes represent the pathways. | 3.8 Molecular dynamics simulations Molecular dynamics simulations were conducted on the top three active components with the highest absolute binding scores - compounds (IL-6-Adenosine, AKT1-Adenosine, TNF-Adenosine Triphosphate) - and the results of these simulations were used to calculate the root mean square deviation (RMSD), radius of gyration (Rog), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), and binding free energy. | These results suggest that the binding of small molecules to receptor proteins results in a stable complex system that does not cause significant changes in receptor conformation. | In contrast, the RMSD of the TNF-Adenosine Triphosphate protein fluctuated significantly, demonstrating that the binding of small molecules to receptor proteins has a significant impact on protein conformation. | The turning radii of AKT1-Adenosine and IL-6-Adenosine remained relatively stable, suggesting that the binding of small molecules to receptors did not significantly affect protein folding. | On the other hand, the radius of TNF-Adenosine Triphosphate gyration exhibited some fluctuation, indicating that the binding of small molecules to receptors had a certain degree of influence on protein folding. | Ginsenosides in Ginseng, for instance, have anti-aging, antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties. | This effect may be facilitated by γ-Aminobutyric acid neurons, which play a role in regulating the excitatory and inhibitory balance within the direct and indirect pathways associated with PD (Sharma et al., 2022; Dolgacheva et al., 2022). | Furthermore, the flavonoids, glycyrrhetinic acid, and isoliquiritigenin in licorice have been found to possess neuroprotective properties against PD caused by neurotoxins such as MPTP and rotenone (Zulfugarova et al., 2023; Moreira et al., 2023; Verma et al., 2022; Ojha et al., 2016). | Moreover, studies have indicated that the flavonoid compound glycyrrhizin in licorice can promote axonal elongation of hippocampal neurons, induce the directional differentiation of neural stem cells into cholinergic neurons, and regulate ERK and AKTGSK-3β pathways to repair nerve cell damage (Moratilla-Rivera et al., 2023; Sidiropoulou et al., 2023; Teng et al., 2014). | Furthermore, reports show that it acts in the brain primarily through inhibitory A1 receptor (A1R) and promotive A2A receptor (A2AR) (Fredholm et al., 2005). | Therefore, targeting TNF-α allow for the optimization of its dual neurotoxic and neuroprotective effects in PD. | Recently, research has revealed the significance of activating the PI3KAKT pathway and its neuroprotective value in PD (Yao et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023b). | The PI3KAKT cascade, which acts on a large number of proteins, is considered a key player in PD models, as research indicates its ability to significantly improve neuronal survival, promote neurogenesis, and inhibit neurotoxin-induced apoptosis (Zheng M. | The higher the expression of the related protein, the stronger the inhibitory impact of SJZD on apoptosis. | First, bioactive compounds and target data were obtained through literature and databases to facilitate predictions, with the reliability and accuracy of these predictions being contingent upon the quality of the data. | Future studies can address this issue through liquid chromatographymass spectrometry (LCMS) technique, both for the analysis of the active compounds of SJZD, and for the study of metabolomics and pharmacokinetic.","Sijunzi Dec (MISC), S (MISC), Parkinsons (MISC), PD (MISC), BATM (ORG), ##AN (MISC), TCM (ORG),

On the other hand, biologicsincluding truncated HGF, the N-terminal SEMA domain of HGF, the soluble extracellular domain of c-MET (decoy MET), and antibodies targeting HGF and c-METsuppress the pathway by preventing the interaction between HGF and c-MET. | Biologics typically offer more specific inhibition of the HGFc-MET signaling pathway than small molecules. | Studies conducted using the H596 NSCLC xenograft model have indicated that combining ficlatuzumab with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors such as erlotinib or cetuximab enhances its anti-cancer effects compared to using either agent alone. | When combined with gefitinib, a small-molecule EGFR inhibitor, TAK-701 effectively suppresses the phosphorylation of both c-MET and EGFR, along with their downstream signaling pathways, in HCC827-HGF tumor cells. | These results suggest that the combined use of TAK-701 and gefitinib might offer a solution to combat resistance to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors in HGF-induced NSCLC (72). | Activated HGFc-MET signaling is linked to poor prognosis and resistance to EGFR inhibitors in NSCLC (74). | On the other hand, the phase II study GO27819 aimed to assess the efficacy of the monovalent MET inhibitor onartuzumab in combination with bevacizumab (OnaBev) versus placebo plus bevacizumab (PlaBev) for recurrent glioblastoma, considering the reported aberrant expression of c-MET in glioblastoma. | Ficlatuzumab demonstrated efficacy when paired with EGFR inhibitors across various advanced solid tumors, including NSCLC. | NSCLC develops resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors with mutations in EGFR through diverse mechanisms, including activating the c-MET receptor pathway. | Upon binding to a membrane antigen, the payload, typically a toxic agent, is facilitated for internalization into cancer cell cytoplasm in response to the lysosomes low pH by ADCs. The payload is a small molecule chemotherapy drug; it can easily cross the membrane through simple diffusion and be released into the neighboring tumor cells upon dissociation from the ADC under lysosomal conditions. | It has been demonstrated to have antitumor activity in cancer cells overexpressing c-MET or with amplified MET, as well as in xenografts, including patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and those resistant to other c-MET inhibitors. | The growth of xenograft tumors resistant to other c-MET inhibitors is effectively inhibited by ABBV-399, which also offers significant therapeutic benefits when combined with standard chemotherapy (101). | In summary, ABBV-399 (telisotuzumab vedotin, Teliso-V) represents a promising advancement in targeting c-MET-overexpressing tumor cells, demonstrating significant antitumor activity across various preclinical models, including those resistant to other c-MET inhibitors. | The Phase I clinical trials have yielded encouraging results, with manageable adverse effects and notable antitumor efficacy, which has propelled the compound into Phase III trials. | 4.3.2 SHR-A1403 (HTI-1066) SHR-A1403, a Phase 1 clinical-stage c-MET-ADC, is a novel formulation comprising a humanized anti-c-MET antibody (of IgG2 subtype) connected via a non-cleavable linker to an enhanced version of a cytotoxic microtubule inhibitor SHR152852. | Further, a novel strategy was proposed to combat resistance to the EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), AZD9291, in NSCLC cells using SHR-A1403 (106). | SHR-A1403 was internalized into resistant cells and released the associated microtubule inhibitor, leading to cell-killing activity dependent solely on c-MET expression levels, irrespective of c-MET or EGFR signaling involvement in AZD9291 resistance. | High antitumor activity was demonstrated by TR1801-ADC in both high and medium-to-low c-MET-expressing cell lines, independent of MET gene copy number, outperforming a c-MET-ADC with a tubulin inhibitor payload. | 4.3.8 P3D12-vc-MMAF Responses to c-MET inhibitors have been seen in clinical trials; however, their effectiveness seems restricted to cases involving MET gene amplifications or mutations. | These data suggest that P3D12-vc-MMAF may offer a superior clinical profile for treating c-MET malignancies compared to c-MET pathway inhibitors (115). | PD-1CD28 chimeric switch receptors (CSR) have emerged, featuring PD-1 extracellular and CD28 intracellular domains, effectively transforming inhibitory PD-1 signals into stimulatory CD28 signals. | To counteract the inhibitory effect of PD-L1 on CAR-T cells, c-MET-specific CAR-T cells expressing PD-1-CSR amplify the stimulatory signals in T cells. | In the case of hEx16-Dbs, domain order may influence the agonistic activity of the anti-CD16 segment, a notion supported by cytokine production tests, which likely explains the enhanced efficacy of one particular hEx16-Db. The HL-type domain arrangement exhibited greater growth inhibitory effects than the LH-type (129). | The potential of c-MET as a therapeutic target takes center stage, offering the tantalizing prospect of dual inhibition against tumorigenesis and immunosuppression with a single c-MET inhibitor. | Additionally, clinical trials combining c-MET inhibitors with immunotherapies have yielded variable outcomes dependent on factors such as cancer subtype and patient demographics.","##G (MISC), PD (MISC), L1 (MISC), MD (MISC), MD (MISC), N (MISC)"

11633099.xml,Effect of Danggui Buxue decoction on hypoxia-induced injury of retinal Müller cells in vitro,"4 Elevated levels of blood sugar disrupt the delicate metabolic balance in the retina and diminish the activity of insulin receptors, which are crucial for the growth, development, and survival of neurons, ultimately leading to neuronal apoptosis.5 Furthermore, elevated levels of oxidative stress, inflammation, diminished neuroprotective factors, and glutamate excitotoxicity are all factors that play a role in the onset of neurodegenerative disorders.6-8 The process of apoptosis is regulated by multiple signaling pathways that can either facilitate or suppress the sequence of events culminating in apoptosis.9 In addition to signaling pathways related to death receptors and mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is also widely considered to be an important factor in initiating cell apoptosis signal transduction.10 Recent studies have shown that ER stress-induced cell apoptosis is closely related to many human diseases, such as diabetes and certain hereditary neurological disorders.11 Numerous studies have shown that stress in ER is significantly involved in the apoptosis and death of retinal cells, particularly in conditions like age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.9 Heightened ER stress results in inflammatory responses and vascular impairment in diabetic and ischemia-induced retinopathy.12 In cultured retinal cells, we detected stress in the ER affecting various cell types such as vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, ganglion cells, and Müller cells. | For ER stress induction, the Tunicamycin group was treated with 2.5 μgmL TM for the first 16 h of hypoxia, while the TUDCA group, serving as the ER stress inhibitor, was treated with 50 μM Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) starting 12 h before the hypoxia exposure.23 These concentrations and timings were chosen based on prior optimization experiments and are consistent with the data presented in the Results section. | Subsequently, a 100-fold concentrated mixture of proteinase and phosphatase inhibitors (Shanghai Sheneng Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) was added. | RRP alleviated hypoxia-induced apoptosis of MIO-M1 cells through ER stress To investigate whether the apoptosis of MIO-M1 cells induced by hypoxia was mediated by ER stress, we introduced the ER stress inhibitor, TUDCA. | Additionally, it has been noted that endogenous VEGF plays a role in maintaining and supporting retinal neurons while also serving as a survival factor for photoreceptor cells.24 It has been documented that the administration of VEGF can also provide protection for retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in different neurotoxic models.25 In a different earlier research, the blocking of VEGF in retinas of normal adult resulted in considerable reduction of ganglion cells.26 Hence, it is crucial to take into account the need for neuroprotection, particularly when treating proliferative diabetic retinopathy with anti-VEGF therapy aimed at reducing neovascularization.27 This may be another possible reason why RRP does not affect the significant up-regulation of VEGF expression in our study. | In our research, RRP has the potential to act as a neuroprotective substance, effectively reducing hypoxia-induced damage in retinal glial cells. | Our study suggests that Danggui Buxue decoction may offer neuroprotection by reducing apoptosis in retinal Müller cells, which is a novel approach compared to the current anti-VEGF strategies. | This potential neuroprotective effect of RRP could be particularly beneficial in the context of DR, where neurodegeneration is a key feature. | This class includes notable families such as the activator protein-1 (AP-1) family, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and CREB-like molecules. | Hypoxia effectively promotes inflammation and angiogenesis, but this can be stopped by using chemical chaperones.9 Therefore, on the other hand, we can also use ER stress inhibitors, such as TUDCA, to block ER stress, thereby alleviating hypoxia-induced retinal injury and inflammatory response in diabetic retinopathy, thereby alleviating DR progression.23 In our study, after hypoxia, ATF4 and CHOP proteins were upregulated in the ER stress of MIO-M1 cells. | Combined with the application of ER stress agonist, TM, and inhibitor, TUDCA, we can determine that the apoptosis of MIOM1 cells after hypoxia is mediated by ATF4CHOP pathway in ER stress, and RRP alleviates apoptosis by inhibiting the expression of factors in ATF4CHOP pathway. | Apoptosis of MIO-M1 cells induced by hypoxia, ER stress inhibitor, and ER stress agonist using Annexin VPI staining.","Danggui Buxue (MISC), R (MISC), R

hydrazones were potent inhibitors of human cholinesterases with inhibition constants (Ki) in micromolar range able to lower the activity of β-secretase, inhibit amyloid aggregation, chelate biometals and act as antioxidants. | Three out of six FDA-approved and currently used anti-Alzheimer drugs are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors that alleviate symptoms of AD by increasing acetylcholine concentrations in synapses thus enhancing neurotransmission and improving memory deficits5. | It has been reported that compounds containing a hydrazone functional (NNH2) group show antimicrobial, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and antitumoral activity16, as well as antioxidant, anticholinesterase, anti-monoamine oxidase, anti-BACE1 activity and inhibitory activity against fibril formation1620. | Moreover, some hydrazone derivatives have shown the potential to act as metal-protein attenuating compounds able to prevent protein aggregation, restore biometal homeostasis and decrease oxidative stress21,22. | Vitamin B6 represents a group of six compounds (pyridoxine, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine and their phosphorylated forms), all with an important biological role in living organisms acting as a coenzyme in numerous enzyme reactions24. | Hydrazone derivatives of vitamin B6 have been investigated as potential angiogenesis inhibitors26 and anti-tuberculosis drugs27, while the pyridyl-hydrazone derivative of vitamin B6 has been described as a potential antimalarial and antitumor agent25. | N-acylhydrazone moiety has been identified as a very promising motif in drug design and medicinal chemistry due to its presence in compounds acting on many different targets displaying antibacterial, antimycobacterial, antiviral, antitumor, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties28,29. | It is desirable that new compounds be synthesized in a safe and energy-efficient way using chemicals whose use assumes a compromise between the economic, social and ecological requirements of the production itself. | In this study, we synthesised eight hydrazone derivatives of pyridoxal and pyridine-4-carbaldehyde and eight N-acylhydrazone derivatives of pyridoxal and evaluated their biological potential against multiple AD hallmarks: inhibitory potential against acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), BACE1 and amyloid self-aggregation, as well as their chelating ability against biometals (Zn(II), Fe(II), Cu (II)), and their antioxidant activity. | These groups of compounds were chosen based on the structural similarity of their hydrazone moiety with amidine moiety in BACE1 inhibitors Verbecestat and Atabecestat, compounds which reached phase II clinical trials on AD patients or phase IIbIII clinical trials, respectively, whose high inhibition potency for BACE1 can be ascribed to formation of multiple hydrogen bonds between its amidine moiety and catalytic aspartates of the BACE1 active site3639. | Finally, to evaluate the potential of the tested compounds as drugs, the hydrazone derivatives displaying the most potent inhibitory activities were tested for their metabolic stability in human liver microsomes and in silico predictions of their human intestinal absorption were estimated. | The assignment of the 1H and 13C signals in the NMR spectra of the compounds was confirmed by cross peaks in the 2D spectra: 1H1H COSY (Correlation Spectroscopy),1H13C HMQC (Heteronuclear Multiple Quantum Coherence) and 1H13C HMBC (Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Correlation). | A TFA-d solution was used as an external reference for the 19F spectrum in compound 9 (19F: δ 11.50 ppm). | Stock solutions of compounds were prepared in DMSO and all further dilutions were done in water. | Synthesis General procedures To synthesise the target hydrazones (compounds 18), a solution of either pyridoxal hydrochloride or pyridine-4-carbaldehyde (0.74 mmol) was combined with the corresponding phenylhydrazine (1.1 equivalents, 0.81 mmol) in a selected solvent, either ethanol or acetone, following Scheme 1A. | Pyridoxal hydrochloride reacted with either benzohydrazide (yielding compounds 914), nicotine (yielding compound 15), or isonicotinohydrazide (yielding compound 16), as illustrated in Scheme 1B. | Briefly, AChE and BChE activities were measured at five different ATCh concentrations (up to 0.50 mM in the absence (v0) and presence (vi) of different hydrazone concentrations (i; final concentrations of 5 300 µM, depending on the compound) needed to obtain 2080 inhibition of enzyme activity. | At least three concentrations of inhibitors for each substrate concentration were used in at least three experiments. | To calculate the enzyme-inhibitor dissociation constants (Ki), the HunterDowns equation and the linear regression analysis41 were used: (1)Ki,appviiv0viKiKiKSs where Ki,app stands for the apparent inhibition constant, and KS for enzymesubstrate dissociation constant. | As relatively low substrate concentrations (up to 0.5 mM) were used in the experiments, the equation was used with the assumption that only the substrate binds to the catalytic anionic site (CAS), while the inhibitor can bind to both the CAS and peripheral anionic site (PAS). | In the graphical presentation of the HunterDawns equation, the linear dependence of Ki,app on the concentration of the substrate shows the competition of the inhibitor with the substrate for binding to the CAS of the enzyme (competitive type; c). | In the case of non-competitive binding (n), when the inhibitor binds only to the PAS of the enzyme, Ki,app does not depend on the concentration of the substrate. | The curve on the HunterDowns plot shows mixed inhibition (m) indicating that the inhibitor binds simultaneously to the CAS and PAS. | The final content of DMSO in measurements was up to 3, and for inhibitory reactions containing more than 0.1 of DMSO and corrected for control reactions containing a corresponding concentration of DMSO. | No side interactions of the tested compounds with ATCh or DTNB were detected. | The ability of compounds to inhibit BACE1 activity was determined as a percentage from the ratio of fluorescence signals obtained from inhibition reaction (FAB, BACE1, substrate and tested hydrazones with final concentrations of 10 µM and 50 µM, respectively) and control reaction (FAB, BACE1 and substrate only). | In the presence of compounds that have the ability to interfere with Aβ42 self-aggregation, a decrease in ThT fluorescence occurs46. | A solution of Aβ42 peptides (final concentration 8 µM) was incubated in the presence (inhibition reaction) and absence (control reaction) of the tested compounds (concentration ratio of Aβ42 peptides and tested compounds in inhibition reaction was 1:1) for 24 h at 37 C47,48. | To determine the potential effect of solvents and compounds on ThT fluorescence, ThT fluorescence was also measured alone with 1 PBS NH4OH DMSO (blank 1) and in the presence of tested compounds and 1 PBS NH4OH only (blank 2). | All control reactions contained DMSO in concentrations corresponding to the final concentration of the tested compounds. | Along with hydrazones, the inhibitory potential of curcumin was also measured as a positive control49. | The selected PDB structures are optimal since a flexible docking procedure was used where residues freely rotate and numerous different enzyme conformations are generated prior to the docking of compounds. | According to that classification, compounds with an LBF lower than 30 are classified as compounds with high, 3070 as moderate and those 70 as compounds with low metabolic stability60. | In silico evaluation of cytochrome P-450 sub-types inhibition To additionally elucidate the ability of compounds to affect the drug metabolism through their interaction with cytochrome P450 enzyme superfamily, prediction of compounds ability to inhibit CYP450 family was estimated in silico using online platform pkCSM. | Models for different P450 isoforms (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) were built using data from 18000 compounds whose ability to inhibit CYP P450 has been experimentally determined61. | Results and discussion Synthesis In this paper, four hydrazone derivatives of pyridoxal (14) and four hydrazone derivatives (58) of pyridine-4-carbaldehyde were prepared (Table 1) by conventional synthesis and MW synthesis in order to determine whether the compounds can be prepared over a shorter time and with higher yields. | The yields obtained ranged 1198, depending on the compounds and the method used. | Yields () obtained for the prepared compounds (116) in conventional and microwave-assisted synthesis (MW). | It was observed that the yields in MW synthesis were lower for all compounds when acetone was used compared to ethanol, which is in accordance with the fact that acetone is a medium microwave absorbing solvent compared to the highly absorbing ethanol. | The cross signals obtained by the HMBC NMR technique confirmed the desired structure of the compounds in the DMSO-d6 solution. | Inhibition of cholinesterases Fifteen compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit the action of AChE and BChE. | The tested compounds were divided into three groups: the first group consisting of four derivatives of pyridoxal and the second of three pyridine-4-carbaldehyde derivatives, while the third group consisted of eight N-acylhydrazone derivatives of pyridoxal. | Generally, all of the tested compounds reversibly inhibited both cholinesterases, AChE and BChE, in micromolar range with inhibition constants (Ki) ranging from 10 to 301 µM (Table 2). | As for AChE, the hydrazones derived from pyridoxal-inhibited AChE, with inhibition constants (Ki) ranging from 16 to 77 µM, were generally more potent inhibitors compared to the hydrazones derived from pyridine-4-carbaldehyde and all of the tested N-acylhydrazones which inhibited AChE with a Ki ranging from 155 to 301 µM, and 89 to 199 µM, respectively. | The most potent inhibitor was 2, a hydrazone derivative of pyridoxal and 2,4-dinitrophenylamine, with Ki 16 µM, which was about 5 times more potent compared to 1. | Compared to Donepezil and Galantamine, drugs used today for the treatment of AD, compound 2 was 670 and 31 times, respectively, a less potent inhibitor of AChE. | The difference in inhibition potency between compound 1 and 2 is a result of the different accommodation of the said compounds in the AChE active site which we assessed using molecular docking (Figure 1). | A list of all of the interactions between the tested compounds 116 and AChE is displayed in Tables S4S19. | Among the hydrazones derived from pyridine-4-carbaldehyde, the most potent AChE inhibitor was 8, with 4-fluorophenylamine. | Although each of the two groups were represented by a small number of compounds, a certain trend in inhibition potency could be observed. | From that group of compounds, the most potent inhibitor was 12, a 4-chlorohydrazone derivative of pyridoxal, which was twice more potent than its parent 9. | To evaluate the ability of compounds to prevent the formation of the stable AChE-Aß complex through interactions with amino acids from the AChE PAS and form toxic Aß peptide aggregates, compounds which displayed non-competitive or mixed inhibition were singled out (Table 2). | Most of the tested compounds inhibited AChE, displaying non-competitive and mixed inhibition without clear connections with their structure. | A non-competitive inhibition was displayed by 2, 7 and 8, while compounds 1, 35, 10 and 12 exhibited mixed inhibition. | In line with that, docking results supported our kinetic results in terms of accommodation of the compounds into the AChE active site gorge and formation of favourable interactions with amino acids from CAS and PAS. | However, the purpose of the molecular modelling tools used in this work was to provide an explanation for the observed kinetic differences among the tested compounds by illustrating binding modes and predicting nonbinding interactions of the compounds of interest, for which flexible molecular docking was used. | Inhibition of BChE was determined for 14 compounds with inhibition constants ranging from 10 to 254 µM, among which compound 1 was the most potent inhibitor of BChE. | Nevertheless, the results showed that the most potent inhibitors from each group were compounds without a substitution on the phenylhydrazone part of the molecule (1 and 5), while compounds with fluorine on the phenylhydrazone part of the molecule (3 and 7) were the least potent, suggesting that the addition of electron withdrawing groups can cause a decrease in inhibition potency towards BChE. | Moreover, it seems that the inhibition of BChE by N-acylhydrazones was affected by the electronegativity of the substituent on the benzohydrazide part of the molecule, as the most potent inhibitor was the compound with an electron donating methyl group (13), while the addition of a strongly electron withdrawingNO2 group (10) did not affect the inhibition potency compared to the unsubstituted 9. | A list of all of the interactions between tested compounds 116 and BChE is displayed in Tables S20S35. | According to recent studies on the pathophysiology of AD and development of drugs, compounds that are non-selective or even selective to BChE could be more effective in the treatment of middle and final stages of disease, in line with studies which showed that, with the progression of the disease, BChE activity increases, while that of AChE decreases67. | The rest of the compounds were up to three times more selective to one of the cholinesterases. | Interestingly, compounds with fluorine (3 and 7) showed only a slight preference towards AChE. | Inhibition of BACE1 As inhibition of BACE1 represents a possible strategy for treatment of Alzheimers disease, we tested the ability of compounds to inhibit its action. | As a measure of inhibition potency, the percentage of inhibition of BACE1 by 10 and 50 µM of compounds was used (Figure 4). | Concentrations were selected based on results of cholinesterase inhibition and corresponded to the determined Ki constants, also keeping in mind the solubility of the compounds. | Our results showed that all of the tested compounds inhibited activity of BACE1 at both concentrations by 1069. | Only compounds 15 and 16 inhibited BACE1 less than 10 at 10 µM. | Although some of these percentages are high, from the viewpoint of developing drugs for the central nervous system, what interests us the most are compounds that inhibit BACE1 activity by less than 50. | Percentages of inhibition by 10 µM compounds meet that criterion, as do most of the compounds at 50 µM. | Inhibition of amyloid self-aggregation All hydrazones, except for compound 6, were tested to evaluate their potential to inhibit self-aggregation of Aβ42 peptides. | All 15 compounds inhibited aggregation of Aβ42 peptides by 1137 (Figure 5). | The most potent inhibitors were N-acylhydrazones 10, 12 and 14, which inhibited amyloid aggregation about 36, followed by 3 and 11 with about 30 of inhibition of amyloid self-aggregation. | Those compounds were about 1.5 less potent than curcumin, which was used as a positive control. | The inhibition percentages of the tested hydrazones are comparable with the IC50 values obtained for 1,4-substituted 4-(1H)-pyridylene-hydrazone-type of inhibitors of fibril building20, pointing to the importance of hydrazine moiety in inhibition of amyloid-β aggregation or fibril destruction. | Generally, all compounds were very good reductants comparable to that of standard antioxidants Trolox and BHT. | Most of the compounds showed better or similar reducing ability to that of BHT, while 7 compounds (1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10) showed better reducing ability compared to Trolox. | Hydrazone derivatives of pyridoxal and pyridine-4-carbaldehyde were generally very potent antioxidants, of which compounds 1, 3 and 4 were two times more potent than Trolox. | The only exception was compound 2 with an NO2-substitued phenylhydrazone group, which was less potent than Trolox. | When it comes to N-acylhydrazone derivatives, only compound 10 had a greater

Ability to cross the BBB The ability of all of the tested hydrazones to cross the BBB by passive transport was estimated by comparing the calculated values of six physicochemical descriptors of compounds (Table S36) with recommended values obtained for known central nervous system (CNS)-active drugs57,7072. | Although hydrazones 9 and 11 have a larger PSA compared to the recommended value, it can be expected that these compounds would be able to pass the BBB since according to the literature, compounds that violate only one of the six physicochemical properties, could cross the BBB57,72. | According to the model, with the absorption percentage in the range between 72 and 93 (Table S37), all of the compounds would likely be very well-absorbed in the human intestines. | Metabolic stability To determine whether and how fast the compound of interest is metabolised, a metabolic stability of compounds 1, 2, 4, 5, 8 and 12, selected based on their high ability to inhibit the action of AChE, BChE, and BACE1, was determined in vitro in human liver microsomes (Table 3). | According to the values of LBF clearance, the selected hydrazones are moderate or high metabolic stable compounds, which indicates their good bioavailability. | In silico prediction of P450 sub-types (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) inhibition (Table S36) showed that majority of compounds do not inhibit CYP enzymes. | The exception was CYP1A2, which was estimated to be inhibited by as many as seven out of a total of 16 tested compounds. | All of the compounds possessed at least four favourable activities against different causative mechanisms which they exerted in comparable concentration ranges. | In addition, most of the compounds displayed a type of reversible inhibition that included interactions with AChE PAS suggesting that those compounds could be able to prevent the formation of neurotoxic AChEAß complexes. | This study singled out two compounds as the most promising multi-target drugs differing in selectivity towards cholinesterases: 1 as butyrylcholinesterase-selective and 4 as a non-selective cholinesterase inhibitor, but all with high inhibition potency towards BACE1, ability to inhibit amyloid-β self-aggregation, to chelate all three metal cations and high ability to act as antioxidants. | Additionally, the metabolic stability of those compounds should allow them to achieve and maintain sufficient concentrations at their sites of action and to be slowly removed from the body. | The fact that these compounds can be successfully synthesised in conventional and environmentally friendly ways highlights them, especially given their structural scaffold, as good models for structural and functional refinement in terms of multi-target drug development.","Alzheimers (MISC), B (MISC), Alzheimers (MISC), AD (MISC), AD (MISC), AD (MISC)"

analyses,"The bioactive compounds in A. | absinthium bioactive compounds targeting Leishmania NMT, identifying potent inhibitors that could serve as new drug candidates.MethodThe extract of A. | absinthium was analyzed using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), identifying nine phenolic compounds, with kaempferol (10.72) and chlorogenic acid (4.43) being the most abundant. | Molecular docking studies were conducted to evaluate the binding affinity of these compounds to NMT. | Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to assess the stability and flexibility of the

and 189. | Drug-likeness analysis revealed that most compounds adhered to Lipinskis rule of five, indicating favorable pharmacokinetic properties. | Normal mode analysis further supported the complexs stability and flexibility.ConclusionThe findings of this study underscore the potential of Artemisia absinthium compounds, particularly apigenin, as promising candidates for the development of new anti-leishmaniasis drugs. | Due to the chemical variety and bioactive characteristics, natural products derived from medicinal plants are interesting and promising compounds for drug discovery (Sasidharan et al., 2011; Balakrishnan et al., 2020). | For instance, plant-derived compounds have been used as the basis for anti-malarial drugs, such as artemisinin and quinine. | Its rich phytochemical profile, including compounds such as flavonoids, terpenoids and phenolic acids, suggests that Artemisia abstinthium could be a source of novel therapeutic agents, particularly for diseases like leishmaniasis for which current treatment options are inadequate (Batiha et al., 2020). | Recent advancements in computer-aided drug discovery allow exploring natural product libraries to identify potential NMT inhibitors. | Molecular docking simulations, a key tool in computer-aided drug discovery, are used by researchers to model the interactions between small molecules and target proteins, enabling the identification of potential inhibitors (Dias et al., 2008; Sliwoski et al., 2014). | The finding that plant-derived compounds, particularly flavonoids and terpenoids, exhibit inhibitory activity against various parasitic enzymes (Mukherjee et al., 2016) suggesting that A. | absinthium also may contain phytochemicals that act as NMT inhibitors. | This allowed us to identify and quantify key bioactive compounds, including flavonoids, phenolic acids and terpenoids. | Then, rigorous computational analyses, including molecular docking simulations, were used to assess their binding affinity and inhibitory potential against Leishmania NMT. | absinthium compounds to target NMT for antileishmanial activity. | The novelty of this study lies in its integrated methodology that allowed identifying bioactive compounds and provided insights into their potential mechanism of action at the molecular level. | The bioactive compounds present in the A. | Phenolic compounds in the sample were detected by measuring their absorbance at wavelength of 280 nm, allowing the accurate identification of the major bioactive compounds in the A. | 2.2 Exploration of potential ligands The therapeutic potential of the compounds present in the A. | absinthium extract was explored based on the extensive literature data on plant-derived compounds against parasitic infections (Adamu et al., 2012; Adamu et al., 2014). | The two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) structures of the identified compounds were retrieved from publicly accessible drug databases, such as PubChem and SwissADME (Li et al., 2010), that contain structural information and features essential for the computational analysis. | 2.3 Drug-likeness assessment The drug-likeness of the identified compounds was evaluated using the SwissADME database (http:www.swissadme.ch). | For each compound, The Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) notations were obtained, and if unavailable, they were drawn using ChemAxons Marvin JS molecular sketcher. | Additionally, the Ghose filter, which imposes further restrictions on molecular size and polarity, was used to refine the compounds drug-likeness. | Radar

compounds blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and gastrointestinal absorption were predicted using Boiled-Egg plots. | 2.4 Target protein selection and molecular docking For the compounds that exhibited favorable drug-likeness profiles, molecular docking studies were performed to assess their inhibitory potential against Leishmania-NMT, an enzyme crucial for the parasite survival and virulence (Satyendra et al., 2015). | The 3D structures of the selected compounds (i.e., the ligands) were retrieved from PubChem (www.pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). | absinthium extract revealed a rich profile of bioactive compounds, predominantly consisting of phenolic acids and flavonoids, which are well-known for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer activities. | The most prominent compound identified was kaempferol, constituting 10.72 of the extract. | These compounds exhibit strong antioxidant activities that protect cells from oxidative stress-induced damage. | For example, caffeic acid and ferulic acid have been linked to neuroprotective effects and the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases (Zhou et al., 2016). | This compound modulates various cellular pathways involved in cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic disorders (Ravindranath et al., 2004). | The diverse array of bioactive compounds identified at varying concentrations in A. | Comparisons with previous studies (Moacă et al., 2019; Elansary et al., 2020) show consistency in identifying key compounds such as caffeic acid, ferulic acid, chlorogenic acid, and quercetin. | Variations in the proportions of these compounds across different studies may arise from differences in plant sources, environmental factors, and extraction methods (Salem et al., 2020; Hbika et al., 2022). | GC-MS studies have identified unique compounds, including margaspidin, stigmasterol, and fatty acid esters, such as octadecanoic and hexadecanoic acid derivatives, which exhibit anticancer properties (Sultan and Moni, 2022). | (2021) on various Artemisia species highlighted major compounds such as kaempferol and artemisinin, reinforcing the therapeutic applications of A. | With the increasing challenges posed by conventional treatments, the exploration of bioactive compounds from A. | Given these limitations, there is increasing interest in bioactive compounds from A. | 3.2

influencing a compounds absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). | Most of the compounds had molecular weights under 500 Da, aligning with Lipinskis rule and suggesting favorable drug-likeness, with caffeic acid (180.16 gmol) and vanillic acid (168.15 gmol) being the lightest. | Most compounds demonstrated good balance, with caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and syringic acid having 4 or fewer hydrogen bond acceptors and donors, enhancing their potential for oral bioavailability. | Molar refractivity (MR), indicating the compounds volume and polarizability, was within the ideal range for most compounds, with kaempferol (76.01) and quercetin (78.03) exhibiting high MR values, supporting their suitability for biological interactions. | Lipophilicity predictions, represented by MLOGP and WLOGP, highlight the compounds ability to cross lipid membranes. | While most compounds fell within optimal ranges, chlorogenic acid had a negative WLOGP (0.75), violating the Ghose filter and suggesting lower membrane permeability. | In terms of overall drug-likeness compliance, most compounds, including caffeic acid, ferulic acid, quercetin, and apigenin, adhered to both Lipinskis rule and the Ghose filter. | However, epigallocatechin gallate did not meet all criteria, with violations in hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, while chlorogenic acid did not pass the Ghose filter due to its low WLOGP, implying lower oral bioavailability compared to the other compounds. | Radar charts (Figure 2) further supported these findings, showing that key pharmacokinetic properties, such as lipophilicity, size, polarity, solubility, saturation, and flexibility, of most compounds were within acceptable ranges for efficient oral absorption. | (2015) further underscore the consistent drug-like properties of compounds like caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and quercetin, confirming their suitability as promising drug candidates across different plant sources. | 3.3 Toxicity assessment of the herbal compounds The toxicity assessment of the selected herbal compounds, based on key toxicological parameters (mutagenic, tumorigenic, irritant, and reproductive effects), provided a comparative analysis of their safety (Table 3). | Using the OSIRIS Property Explorer, the compounds under study were ranked according to their toxicity and drug-likeness and drug scores. | The drug score summarizes in a single value the drug-likeness, ClogP, LogS, molecular weight and toxicity risks of a compound. | TABLE 3 Summary of the predicted toxicity risks, drug-likeness, and drug score for the compounds extracted from Artemisia absinthium extract, assessed using OSIRIS Property Explorer. | Nevertheless, both compounds were considered safe and promising for drug development due to their minimal toxicity risks. | However, the mutagenic risks associated with these compounds suggest that safety evaluations are essential before further development. | The toxicity profile variations among the compounds under study suggest that although many exhibit promising drug-like properties, their safety profiles must be carefully taken into account for their potential therapeutic applications. | Among the nine evaluated compounds, apigenin emerged as the most effective binder, exhibiting the strongest binding affinity with an estimated binding energy of 9.6 kcalmol. | While both of these compounds demonstrate substantial binding, their binding energies suggest slightly less favorable interactions than those observed for apigenin. | Among the nine evaluated compounds, apigenin emerged as the most effective binder, exhibiting the strongest binding affinity with an estimated binding energy of 9.6 kcalmol. | While both of these compounds demonstrate substantial binding, their binding energies suggest slightly less favorable interactions than those observed for apigenin. | (2016), which highlighted the potent bioactivity of apigenin against Leishmania amazonensis, where the compound induced reactive oxygen species production and mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately leading to autophagy and cell death. | The remaining compounds, including ferulic acid, syringic acid, vanillic acid, chlorogenic acid, and kaempferol, exhibit weaker binding affinities, with estimated binding energies ranging from 4.7 to 6.3 kcalmol. | This trend aligns with the findings of Stefaniu and Pirvu (2022), who conducted an in silico analysis of 50 polyphenolic compounds and concluded that flavonoids like apigenin consistently exhibit stronger bioactivity and bioavailability than polyphenolic acids such as ferulic and syringic acids. | Given the superior binding affinities and strong interactions of apigenin, quercetin, epigallocatechin gallate, and caffeic acid, these four compounds warrant further investigation in subsequent studies (Figure 3). | These findings emphasize the potential of these compounds for future therapeutic strategies against leishmaniasis, making them the focus of our analysis moving forward. | The olive orange color indicates the target protein (NMT), yellow denotes the ligand (compounds from Artemisia absinthium extract), red represents the hydrogen-bonding residues, and blue shows the hydrophobic interacted residues. | (2022), who reported that various bioactive compounds, including polyphenolics similar to apigenin, exhibit strong enzyme-inhibiting properties. | highlighted the inhibitory effects of compounds from Perilla frutescens on enzymes like NMT, noting their significant pharmacological potential due to their ability to modulate posttranslational enzyme activity. | These findings further support apigenins potential as a promising NMT inhibitor in therapeutic applications, especially in combating diseases like leishmaniasis where NMT plays a crucial role. | This stability mirrors findings by Yang and Kar (2024), where MD simulations of small molecules against the Nipah virus demonstrated that compounds with low RMSD values tend to maintain stable interactions within their binding sites, enhancing their potential as inhibitors. | In this context, stability in RMSD is often linked to a well-defined binding conformation, further implying apigenins potential as a robust NMT inhibitor. | They highlight that low RMSD values are indicative of stable ligand-protein interactions and serve as strong predictors of effective inhibitors in structure-based drug design. | The stability reflected by these low RMSF values is essential for apigenins potential therapeutic efficacy as an inhibitor. | This rigidity is a key characteristic of effective inhibitors, as noted by Sharma et al. | (2021), which further underscores apigenins potential as a robust NMT inhibitor. | Moreover, the presence of the double bond in apigenins structure contributes to its rigidity and facilitates proper alignment within the active site of the enzyme, thereby strengthening its inhibitory potential (Xiao et al., 2023). | This stability is critical, as it suggests that interactions with residues like LYS 318 and ARG 274 help preserve the structural integrity of NMT, aligning with apigenins potential as an effective NMT inhibitor. | The consistent interactions between apigenin and these stabilizing residues provide a solid foundation for its inhibitory effect on NMT, as suggested by the free energy landscape and corroborated by MD analysis. | Such insights are essential for drug discovery and development, as they elucidate the complex molecular behavior that influences the effectiveness of potential inhibitors like apigenin. | 4 Conclusion This study examined the phytochemical profile, drug-likeness, toxicity risks, and molecular interactions of bioactive compounds derived from Artemisia absinthium. | Among the key compounds identifiedcaffeic acid, ferulic acid, syringic acid, epigallocatechin gallate, vanillic acid, chlorogenic acid, kaempferol, quercetin, and apigeninapigenin and caffeic acid demonstrated the most promising characteristics for leishmaniasis treatment. | Apigenin, in particular, showed a strong inhibitory effect on Leishmania N-myristoyltransferase (NMT), with a binding energy of 9.6 kcalmol and significant interactions with threonine residues 203 and 189. | Drug-likeness analysis confirmed that most compounds met Lipinskis rule of five, indicating favorable pharmacokinetic properties, while toxicity assessments revealed low-risk profiles for apigenin and caffeic acid. | Normal mode analysis further supported the complexs stability and flexibility, underscoring apigenins potential as a reliable NMT inhibitor. | These findings highlight apigenin and caffeic acid as promising candidates for antileishmanial drug development, providing a foundation for future research aimed at optimizing these compounds for clinical applications.","Artemisia (MISC), ##ish (MISC), Leishmania N (MISC), N (MISC), A (MISC), N

accomplished to further investigate the potent compounds interaction, orientation, and conformation over the related enzymes. | All these results indicate that 7c is a good starting point for developing a multifunctional anti-Alzheimer compound. | GSK3α has been shown to regulate APP cleavage resulting in the increased production of Aβ.14 It was confirmed that the reduced level of GSK-3β led to improve cognition, axonal transport, and impairment linked to alleviate neurodegenerative diseases.15 Current drug FDA-approved therapy for AD is based on restoring cholinergic activity using ChE inhibitors, including donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine. | Heterocyclic compounds, such as those containing phthalimide and isoindolinedione moieties, have garnered significant attention in medicinal chemistry due to their potential as ChE inhibitors.1821 Notably, pyridinium hybrids and N-arylpyridinium-based derivatives have demonstrated promising inhibitory activity against both AChE and BChE.2224 As a result, we present the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a novel series of isoindoline-1,3-dione derivatives bearing benzamide pyridinium, 7aq, as potential ChE inhibitors for systematic treatment and improving cognition and memory. | 2 Results and Discussion 2.1 Designing Heterocycles, which contain at least one heteroatom such as nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur, play a crucial role in medicinal chemistry as cholinesterase inhibitors.25,26 Phthalimide, isoindoline-1,3-dione, and their structurally related heterocycles analogs represent a class of compounds utilized in the search for novel hit or lead compounds as ChE inhibitors, owing to their distinctive structural features. | It was concluded that the length of the linker plays the most

Approach,"Bedaquiline (BDQ), a diarylquinoline compound, is an inhibitor of mycobacterial ATP synthase, specifically with FDA approval as a treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). | The objective of this study was to establish and validate a sensitive and convenient ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MSMS) approach to concurrently quantify BDQ and M2 in rat plasma and to examine whether resveratrol, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, could influence the pharmacokinetics of BDQ and M2 in rats. | 1 Introduction Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is an infection in which Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is resistant to at least rifampin and isoniazid.1 Second-line antituberculosis drugs are recommended for the treatment of MDR-TB, which usually costs 1824 months.2 Bedaquiline (BDQ) is an FDA-approved drug for treating MDR-TB and is one of the second-line antituberculosis drugs.3 BDQ is a diarylquinoline compound that is specifically able to inhibit mycobacterial ATP synthase.4 It was found that in a randomized phase II placebo-controlled clinical trial, patients with MDR-TB who received the standard MDR regimen and BDQ therapy converted to negative cultures within 8 weeks in 48, versus 9 in the placebo group receiving only the standard MDR regimen.5 After 24 weeks, the proportions of successfully treated patients in the BDQ and placebo groups were 78.8 and 57.6, respectively.5 Nevertheless, QT interval prolongation could be caused by BDQ, which might result in irregular and fatal heart rhythms.6 In addition, other adverse reactions, such as drug-related hepatic disorders, metabolism and nutrition disorders (hyperuricemia being the most common), electrolyte disorders, and gastrointestinal system disorders can also occur during the treatment of BDQ.7 The description of BDQ metabolism will be valuable for the prediction and prevention of BDQ-related drug- or food-drug interactions. | In multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, the quantitative analysis was performed following one selective transition for each compound with mz 555.00 58.08 for BDQ, mz 540.93 479.92 for M2, and mz 338.01 296.03 for IS (shown in Table 1). | The compounds were easily protonated on amino groups; therefore, MRM was selected for positive monitoring mode. | Intraday and interday precision of the three QCs and LLOQ was found to be less than 12.2. And the accuracy of the analytes did not exceed 14.0. This present method achieved good data reproducibility, as all data were within the acceptable validation criteria for the compounds. | Finally, further studies about the effect of RVT on BDQ metabolism in clinical studies and its inhibitory mechanism should be further investigated.","Bed (MISC), FDA (ORG), MDR (MISC), TB (MISC), UPLC (MISC), MS (MISC), CYP3A4 (MISC), UPLC (MISC), MS (MISC), FDA (ORG), UPLC (MISC), MS (MISC), FDA (ORG)"

11637464.xml,A multiplexed, single-cell sequencing screen identifies compounds that increase neurogenic reprogramming of murine Muller glia,"With the goal of improving this in mammals, we designed a small molecule screen using sci-Plex, a method to multiplex up to thousands of single-nucleus RNA-seq conditions into a single experiment. | We used this technology to screen a library of 92 compounds, identified, and validated two that promote neurogenesis in vivo. | Given the vast array of small molecules and biologics available, there is potential to screen for factors that improve such gene therapy techniques. | When these mice are subjected to retinal injury using a neurotoxic dose of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) and subsequently treated with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, the MG regenerate functional neurons in adult mice (Jorstad et al., 2017). | Several studies have shown that cell signaling molecules can also affect the process of reprogramming cell fates, and investigators have suggested that small molecules might be useful in optimizing this approach for clinical applications of neural repair in combination or separate from TF overexpression (Jorstad et al., 2020; Gascón et al., 2016; Janowska et al., 2019; Cheng et al., 2015; Gao et al., 2017). | To identify additional compounds that aid in the reprogramming process and further stimulate neurogenesis from MG-derived progenitors, we set forth to design an assay that could scale the number of small molecules tested in a given in vitro experiment. | Our application of sci-Plex to reprogramming MG is the first demonstration of sci-Plexs utility for screening chemical compounds in a low abundance primary cell type with disease relevance. | When we applied sci-Plex to a small molecule screen for factors associated with stem cell biology, we uncovered compounds that had effects on neurogenesis and total cell recovery. | Several of the most effective compounds identified in vitro were further tested in vivo in a reprogramming assay where Ascl1 is over-expressed specifically in MG (i.e. ANT protocol). | The results of this secondary in vivo screen identified two compounds that significantly enhanced neurogenesis in adult mouse retina. | sci-Plex as a screen to identify small molecules that affect Ascl1-dependent MG reprogramming The above results supported the potential of sci-Plex to study neurogenic reprogramming, so we next embarked on a larger-scale screen for factors that can improve the efficiency of neurogenesis from MG. | The compounds target a range of biological functions with a bias toward epigenetic modulators and modulators of common signaling pathways (Figure 2A). | The compounds were applied across three doses (0.1, 1, and 10 uM) with each compound being tested on one of two different collection days. | To maximize the range of compounds tested, we opted to perform the sci-Plex experiment once, and then follow-up with compounds that elicited strong effects through subsequent in vivo validation experiments. | In sum, we screened 92 small molecules and two control conditions from a total of 265 individual wells after filtering out conditions with low cell recovery. | sci-Plex as a screen to identify small molecules that affect Ascl1-dependent Muller glia (MG) reprogramming. | (A) Bar plot representing the distribution of targets for the 92 compounds included in the screen. | (B) Schematic of the experimental design for the small molecule screen. | The dose of each compound is indicated by the size of the dot. | The compounds dose is indicated by the size of the dot. | Sequencing quality control of small molecule sci-Plex screen. | Cell type annotation of small molecule sci-Plex screen. | These compounds target one of three molecular signaling pathways: Notch, BMPTGF-beta, and LCKSRC. | Both sodium 4-phenylbutyrate and valproic acid are HDAC inhibitors which is of interest because TSA (Trichostatin A), another HDAC inhibitor, is a significant stimulus for Ascl1-dependent reprogramming in vivo (Jorstad et al., 2017). | Unexpectedly, metformin, a compound that is approved for the treatment of diabetes with other potential clinical uses (Cicero et al., 2012), also increased cell recovery in our assay. | Because metformin has not been evaluated in the context of retinal reprogramming, we decided to pursue it and the five compounds that increased neurogenesis with further experiments in vivo. | Thus, the use of sci-Plex aided us in narrowing down 92 compounds to 6 for follow-up investigations. | Interestingly, the treatments that led to the Unknown cluster include two HDAC inhibitors (CI 994, SAHA) (Kraker, 2003; Butler et al., 2000). | The treatments that lead to increased cell counts in the ER stressed cluster include two bromodomain (acetylated lysine binders) inhibitors (I-BET 151 dihydrochloride, CPI 203) (Devaiah et al., 2012; Dawson et al., 2011). | While these observations do not directly help us identify better treatments for reprogramming MG, they do help us find compounds that affect the molecular state of MG cells exposed to Ascl1 overexpression (Jorstad et al., 2017). | Before testing compounds from the in vitro screen in vivo, we sought to validate that in vivo MG express the signaling pathways targeted by our small molecule compounds during neurogenic reprogramming. | In all cases, at least some of the target genes are expressed early and decrease over time, making them ideal candidates for small molecule intervention. | (F) Heatmap of the in vivo expression of genes related to the pathways regulated by the top small molecules hits from the in vitro screen. | (G) Experimental paradigm for testing the in vivo effect of hit compounds on reprogramming. | Using the same mice as above, we aimed to validate five hits in vivo (the γ-secretase inhibitor DBZ, Lck and Src inhibitor WH-4-023, LKB1AMPK activator metformin, the BMP inhibitor DMH-1, and the TGF-BR1 inhibitor SB43152) for their ability to increase neurogenic reprogramming of MG in vivo. | Ascl1 was induced in the MG with tamoxifen, retinal injury was performed by NMDA, and TSA was given in conjunction with one of the small molecule hits from the screen; animals were sacrificed 2 weeks later, and their retinas were assayed for lineage traced MG-derived cells (GFP) and the retinal neuronal maker (Otx2) (Figure 3G). | Out of the compounds tested, two significantly boosted the number of Otx2 neuronal cells (Figure 3HJ, Figure 3figure supplement 4A). | The first identified compound was DBZ, a γ-secretaseNotch inhibitor (Figure 3I). | This is consistent with reports in the chick retina where the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT increased neuronal differentiation from proliferating MG (Hayes et al., 2007; Ghai et al., 2010; Todd et al., 2016). | While this result was not unexpected, DBZ represents a new compound found to promote neurogenesis in the mammalian retina. | These in vivo experiments thus confirm that the in vitro sci-Plex screening is an effective method to identify new compounds that increase the regeneration potential of mammalian MG. | Discussion Screening large numbers of chemical compounds has become a routine path to drug discovery, but limitations remain. | Next, we tested 92 compounds across 3 doses each and identified 6 molecules of interest, two of which also had significant proneural effects in vivo. | The first hit of our screen was the Notch inhibitor DBZ. | That our screen recovered a γ-secretase inhibitor, in line with the known role of Notch in the retina, confirmed the ability of our workflow to identify important regulators. | Unexpectedly, the second compound that increased neurogenesis in vivo was metformin. | Mechanistically, metformin is typically thought to work via AMPK, and while used clinically for Type2 diabetes, many studies have noted its neuroprotective and anti-neuroinflammatory effects (Markowicz-Piasecka et al., 2017). | Layering in the use of small molecules can increase the efficiency of such reprogramming, and we show here that screening through larger libraries of compounds at single-cell resolution in vitro can point us toward new in vivo hits. | We are particularly excited by the future therapeutic potential of our compounds: metformin and DBZ; as well as the use of similar screening strategies for the identification of treatments in glial-based regeneration and wider contexts. | Filtering and dimensionality reduction (small molecule screen) For both Collections 1 and 2, cells with 500 UMIs, 20,000 UMIs, or a top_to_second_best_ratio 5 were discarded. | Sub clustering of reprogramming MG cells (small molecule screen) The cells annotated as Bipolar and Reprogramming_MG were selected and dimensionality reduction was performed of the subset of cells with 30 PCA dimensions, a mindist of 0.1, and 12 nearest neighbors.","non (MISC), Muller (MISC), MG (MISC), MG (MISC), Asc (MISC), ##1 (MISC), MG (MISC), P (MISC), ##ian (MISC), C (LOC), non (MISC), Todd (PER), Reh (PER), Jorstad (PER), Lentini (PER)"

Su et al., 2009), nor the specific PLC inhibitor U-73122 (Bleasdale et al., 1989) had any significant effect on neurite formation or progenitor proliferation in MarcksMarcksl1-depleted spinal cords (Figure 4AD). | In contrast, the PIP2 synthesis inhibitor ISA-2011B had no significant effect (Figure 4E, F). | To test this hypothesis, we used the potent PKC activator Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and the broad-spectrum PKC inhibitor Go6983 (Liu and Heckman, 1998; Shen, 2003). | Compared to DMSO-treated controls, embryos treated with the PKC inhibitor Go6983 showed a significant increase in the intensity of acetylated tubulin staining (Figure 4G) as well as in the proportion of PH3-positive cells (Figure 4H) on the CRISPR-injected side relative to the uninjected side. | In contrast, the PKC activator PMA had no significant effect (Figure 4G, H). | 4M CRISPR-injected tadpoles with SCI were exposed to the activator of phospholipid signaling S1P, the PLD inhibitor FIPI, or only DMSO in control embryos for 7 days. | Conversely, tadpoles exposed to the PLD inhibitor FIPI traveled a shorter distance than the DMSO controls, but this difference was insignificant (Figure 9P). | In contrast, it was significantly higher in the animals incubated in the PLD inhibitor FIPI (Figure 9AC, Q). | The proportion of proliferative EdU cells (Figure 9DI, R) and of Sox2 neuro-glial progenitor cells (Figure 9JO, S) was also significantly increased in the tadpoles incubated in S1P and significantly decreased in those exposed to the PLD inhibitor FIPI compared to DMSO controls. | Thus, in all parameters investigated, 4M CRISPR tadpoles treated with an activator of phospholipid signaling adopted a phenotype resembling normal tadpoles after SCI. | In contrast, those treated with a PLD inhibitor showed more severe loss of function phenotypes than untreated CRISPR tadpoles. | (AO) Horizontal sections of 4M CRISPR-injected tadpoles at stage 50 exposed to DMSO only (controls;

Basal Chemical Profile of Olive Cultivars Differing in Verticillium dahliae Resistance,"The use of an innovative UHPLC-ESI-TimsTOF MSMS platform enabled the annotation of more than 70 compounds across different olive organs (root, stem, and leaf) and the creation of a preliminary compilation of TIMSCCSN2 experimental data for more reliable metabolite annotation. | Moreover, it allowed the documentation of numerous isomeric species in the studied olive organs by resolving hidden compounds. | Thus, several secondary metabolites (mainly phenolic compounds) have been evaluated in various infected olive organs and tissues (roots, stems, cortex, xylem, etc.) to explore their role in the plants defense mechanisms against V. | However, there remains a notable lack of experimental CCS databases in plant metabolomics, particularly for compounds without available pure standards, such as those derived from olive matrices. | Being aware of the existence of a significant information gap regarding VWO disease and the capabilities of the analytical platform used, this study pursued three main objectives: (i) to evaluate the potential of the innovative UHPLC-ESI-TimsTOF MS platform to maximize metabolome information from olive-derived matrices, leading to the creation of a preliminary list of compounds based on collision cross-section values (TIMSCCSN2); (ii) characterize the presence or absence of these secondary metabolites in various olive plant organs; and (iii) apply an untargeted approach to comprehensively investigate and delineate basal metabolic differences in roots, stems, and leaves of 43 olive cultivars as a function of their resistance to Verticillium dahliae Kleb. | The standard solution mix used for qualitative purposes was prepared by mixing the exact amount of all pure standards mentioned above in EtOHH2O (80:20, vv) to obtain a concentration of around 15 mgL for each compound. | These tools include (i) SmartFormula, which derives the molecular formula of each annotated compound based on its accurate mass and isotopic pattern, taking into account any detected adducts; (ii) Compound Crawler, which searches molecular structures for specified molecular formulas in local (AnalyteDB) and online public databases (ChEBI, ChemSpider and PubChem); and (iii) MetFrag, which performs in silico fragmentation of potential structures and compares them with acquired MSMS spectra. | Typical bioactive compounds primarily consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. | Therefore, our focus was on annotating compounds containing these elements, aiming for errors below 5 ppm. | The annotated constituents are listed in Table 1 of Supporting Information (Table S1) including the proposed compound name, chemical family, calculated molecular formula, retention time (Rt), experimental mz, error of the mass prediction (ppm), mSigma value, TIMSCCSN2 value, and the main MSMS fragments observed. | The proposed compounds were cross-checked with relevant comprehensive studies focused on the in-depth characterization of olive-derived matrices to ensure their identity or confirmed using Bruker spectral libraries.23,24,3436 The ion mobility descriptor was used to support metabolite identification whenever a standard was available, or if the compounds were described in the plant metabolomics TIMSCCSN2 library generated by Schroeder and collaborators in a previous work,37 or in other works applying TIMS mobility.38,39 Additionally, it was used to propose a candidate if the predicted CCS value was consistent with the putative annotation. | As expected, most of the compounds annotated are of phenolic nature, such as simple phenols, secoiridoids, flavonoids, etc. | These compounds were consistently present in all organs under investigation. | Three instances of iridoids (compounds characterized by a six-membered ring containing an oxygen bound to a cyclopentane ring) were annotated in the ethanolic extracts. | The fragmentation pattern of this compound revealed the detachment of the sugar moiety, releasing its aglycone at mz 177.0192. | In all cases, being glycosylated compounds, the HRMSMS spectra consistently showed a loss of 162 mz, confirming the association with a glucose unit attached to the lignan aglycone. | The group with the highest number of metabolites consisted of secoiridoids and derivatives, which are undoubtedly one of the most representative families of compounds in olive matrices. | In Table S1, 27 compounds belonging to this chemical class have been described. | Another notable subgroup of secoiridoids distributed in the three matrices considered were the compounds related to elenolic acid. | Flavonoids proved to be another important group of phenolic compounds present mainly in olive stems and leaves. | Both compounds were confidently annotated as they showed a typical fragmentation pattern with MS signals at 285.0409, 177.0199, and 125.0263 mz (for taxifolin) and 259.0598, 243.0661, 177.0561, 151.0039, and 125.0244 mz (for dihydrokaemferol).3436 Among the flavonoids that were systematically found in stem and leaf extracts, it is possible to mention the following: naringenin-O-glucoside (C21H22O10; 183.1 Å2), rutin (C27H30O16; 232.4 Å2), three isomers of luteolin-O-glucoside (C21H20O11; 210.2 Å2, 208.4 Å2, and 210.2 Å2), two isomers of quercetin-O-glucoside (C21H20O12; 202.1 Å2 and 210.9 Å2) and apigenin-7-O-glucoside (C21H20O10; 208.1 Å2). | In all cases, the HRMSMS spectra of these glycosylated compounds revealed a cleavage of the sugar (162 mz), releasing the aglycone form. | It is worth noting that the following 4 compounds only appeared in the olive leaf samples: two isomers of apigenin-O-rutinoside (C27H30O14; 232.7 Å2 and 224.5 Å2), diosmin (C28H32O15; 231.8 Å2) and chrysoeriol-7-O-glucoside (C22H22O11; 215.9 Å2). | In addition, the regression coefficient was also included in the table to indicate the relative abundance of each compound in these categories. | The box and whisker plots of the compounds with the highest VIP values in each category are shown in Figure S3. | Relevant compounds described above in olive matrices include the putative name in the table, as well as the reference to the relevant literature used for their characterization. | Other substances previously described in other plant species are mentioned in the discussion when the compound could match the observed one. | Table 2 Metabolites from Olive Root, Stem, and Leaf Organs from VWO-Highly Resistant (HR) and Susceptible (S) Olive Cultivars that Exhibited the Highest Relevance in PLS-DA Models (VIP 1.50) putative compound identity chemical classa RT (min) mzexp molecular formula error (ppm) mSigma CCS (Å2) main fragments via MSMS R.C.

underlined compounds indicate their previous annotation in the initial screening (Section 3.1). | Before delving into the details of Table 2, it is important to note that the distinctive compositional patterns of cultivars within a specific category depend on a combination of compounds, their relative concentrations, and potential metabolic pathways, all of which add to the complexity of the matter. | In the model developed to discriminate the root extracts of the HR-cultivars from the rest, 18 compounds were found to have significance (VIP above 1.50), with 11 of them having negative correlation coefficients (i.e., exhibiting relatively low concentrations in the HR-cultivars). | Among the negatively correlated metabolites, the compound eluting at 6.95 min with a predominant MS signal with mz of 337.1080 was tentatively annotated as a sinapyl alcohol(8- 5)coniferyl aldehyde derivate (-H2O, CH2O), taking the previous results of Contreras et al. | into account.45 The following compounds were also negatively correlated in the models for olive root extracts with HR cultivars: vanilloyl glucosidevanillic acid hexoside, methyl gallate glucoside and D-mannitol, which were annotated on the basis of previously published reports. | Considering that they eluted at the beginning of the chromatogram (1.31 and 1.25 min, respectively), these metabolites could be some kind of sugar derivatives, such as 3-deoxy-d-glycero-D-galacto-2-nonulosonic acid, found in roots of transgenic tobacco plants or hexosylglycerate, reported in soybean root nodules.54,55 To the best of our knowledge, these compounds have not been previously identified in any olive matrix and further attempts should be made to corroborate these hypotheses. | Unknown 5 at 523.1878 mz (C18H36O17), which was also found to be a relevant compound in this category, could not be annotated. | Among the positively correlated compounds, significant metabolites annotated included a lactone (hydroxytyrosol ester), a dihexose derivative of elenolic acid and a glucoside derivative of hydroxytyrosol. | In addition, a compound characterized by the predicted molecular formula C8H14O8 (unknown 7) could be tentatively annotated as a sugar derivative, as 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate, based on its retention time and predicted CCS value. | Regarding susceptible cultivars (olive roots of S cultivars), and paying attention first to the annotated compounds, a negative correlation was found for the isomer 3 of the cycloolivil glycoside (C26H34O12; 214.5 Å2). | dahliae.24 Despite the different isomer designation, we are certainly referring to the same compound, as the isomer 3 within the current work involves chromatographic separation of isomer 1, while isomer 2 coelutes with the initial peak. | Another significant compound was D-sedoheptulose. | This general statement was partially suggested by Cardoni and coauthors in a previous work.23 Eight compounds were pointed out as the most influential ones in the model built to discriminate between HR-cultivars and the rest based on stem extracts. | Thus, HR-cultivars correlated positively with elenolic acid-methyl ester, hydroxydecarboxymethyl elenolic acid and four unidentified compounds at 283.1187 mz (unknown 12; C14H20O6), 277.1804 mz (unknown 13; C17H26O3), 363.1659 mz (unknown 14; C16H28O9) and 353.0878 mz (unknown 15; C16H18O9). | When using olive leaf extracts, seven compounds were found to have the highest discriminant power in the models separating HR-cultivars from the rest of the cultivars, while 16 possible markers were pointed out to characterize the S-cultivars. | Among the 16 compounds pointed out as potential markers to define the distinctive compositional characteristics of the S-cultivars, 12 were positively correlated and the rest negatively correlated. | Within the positive correlated biomarkers, the compound with molecular formula C33H40O18 was annotated as a phenolic acid derivate named 1-sinapoyl-2-feruloylgentiobiose bearing in mind the information reported by Alcántara and coauthors for olive leaf tissue as well.51 Coumaroyl hexoside annotated through HRMSMS library (see Figure S4), naringenin, dihydroxyhexadecanoic acid, luteolin-O-glucoside (is. | Unknown 21 (C44H52O24;

11639962.xml,Screening of a Fraction with Higher Amyloid β Aggregation Inhibitory Activity from a Library Containing 210 Mushroom Extracts Using a Microliter-Scale High-Throughput Screening System with Quantum Dot Imaging,"Previously, we developed a microliter-scale high-throughput screening (MSHTS) system using quantum dot (QD) nanoprobes to screen Aβ aggregation inhibitors. | In this study, we appraised the Aβ aggregation inhibitory activity of 210 natural mushrooms from Hokkaido (Japan) and found 11 samples with high activity. | applanata has high Aβ aggregation inhibitory activity, so we performed silica gel column chromatography fractionation and found that fraction 5 (f5) of the EtOAc extract displayed the highest Aβ aggregation inhibitory activity among all mushroom samples. | The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) value was 2.30 µgmL, higher than the EC50 of 10.7 µgmL for rosmarinic acid, a well-known Aβ aggregation inhibitor. | This inhibitory activity decreased with further purification, suggesting that some compounds act synergistically. | Our expectation is that f5, with additional tests, may eventually prove to be an inhibitor for the prevention of AD. | In recent years, researchers from various countries have made considerable progress in screening Aβ aggregation inhibitors, with natural extracts increasingly showing strong Aβ aggregation inhibitory activity . | These bioactive ingredients not only have antioxidant, anti-bacterial, and anti-tumor effects but also show potential neuroprotective properties . | Therefore, edible mushrooms with neuroprotective properties have attracted attention as a possible countermeasure for AD. | Currently, thioflavin T (ThT) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are widely used to evaluate the Aβ aggregation inhibitory activity of various substances and to observe Aβ aggregation . | However, ThT dyes and fluorescent substances may cause internal filtering effects, and inhibitors may compete with ThT for binding to Aβ . | In this study, the purpose was to evaluate the Aβ aggregation inhibitory activity of different species of mushrooms collected in Hokkaido, Japan. | We used this MSHTS system based on QD fluorescence imaging to rapidly and accurately evaluate the Aβ aggregation inhibitory activity of 210 mushrooms. | We found that 11 mushrooms showed high Aβ aggregation inhibitory activities. | With further purification, the ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extract fraction 5 (f5) of Elfvingia applanata (t037) showed the highest inhibitory activity. | In summary, we hope that f5 can be developed into an effective inhibitor for preventing AD in the future. | The most active fraction, f5, was further fractionated, but inhibitory activity decreased. | To verify the MSHTS results of fraction 5 (f5) and fraction 3 of f5 (f5f3), we further evaluated the inhibitory activity of f5 and f5f3 on Aβ aggregation using ThT assay. | Results 3.1. Evaluation of the Aβ Aggregation Inhibitory Activity of 210 Mushroom Species An automated MSHTS system was used to assess the Aβ aggregation inhibitory activity of crude extracts of 210 mushroom species (Supplementary Table S1) collected in Hokkaido, Japan. | Based on the evaluation results, 11 mushrooms with inhibitory activity were selected from among the 210 mushrooms (Figure 1). | In our previous study, we evaluated the Aβ aggregation inhibitory activity of more than 500 plants, of which more than 50 plants, accounting for about 10 of the total, had EC50 values below 0.05 mgmL (50 µgmL), so we decided to use a value below 50 µgmL as the high activity standard . | According to the EC50 values, the values of 11 mushroom extracts were less than 50 µgmL, which showed high Aβ aggregation inhibitory activity (Figure 1B). | We tested the 11 mushroom extracts with Aβ inhibitory activity, using the MTT assay, to verify whether they could inhibit Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells (Figure 2). | The t100 and t020 mushroom extracts significantly increased PC12 cell viability at 50 μgmL, increasing it to 59.98 and 65.26, respectively, indicating that they had the best inhibitory effect on Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells. | Some mushroom extracts presumably contain cytotoxic substances, and even if they have high Aβ aggregation inhibitory activity, cell viability may not necessarily be high. | Therefore, in this study, which also considers functional food applications, we focused on mushroom extracts with high Aβ aggregation inhibitory activity and cell viability enhancing activity. | In order to purify the active ingredients in the extracts, these two crude extracts were dissolved in five different solvents to re-evaluate Aβ aggregation inhibitory activity. | All of them showed high inhibitory activity (Figure 3C). | On the other hand, the activity of the hexane and water fractions was relatively low (Figure 3C), suggesting that the aggregation inhibitors have properties intermediate between hydrophobic and hydrophilic. | 3.4. Evaluation of the Inhibitory Activity of the EtOAc Extract of t037 The t037 and t100 extracts showed high inhibitory activities in Et2O and EtOAc solvents, and the EtOAc extract of t037 had the smallest EC50 value among the 10 samples. | MSHTS analysis showed that f5 had the highest inhibitory activity with an EC50 of 2.30 0.859 µgmL. | MSHTS analysis found that f5f3 had the highest inhibitory activity with an EC50 of 7.26 6.24 µgmL. | However, compared with f5, f5f3s inhibitory activity was reduced (Figure 4A,C,D). | To further verify the inhibitory activity of f5 and f5f3, a ThT assay was also performed on them (Supplementary Figure S1). | Compared with the Aβ group only, f5 and f5f3 reduced the fluorescence intensity in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that f5 and f5f3 have high inhibitory activity against Aβ aggregation toxicity. | This result also suggests that f5 has a higher aggregation inhibitory activity than f5f3, similar to the result of MSHTS (Figure 4A). | These results suggest that some of the compounds of f5 act synergistically through currently unknown mechanisms. | In this study, we analyzed the inhibitory effects of f5 and f5f3 on extracellular Aβ deposition in SH-SY5Y cells, human neuroblastoma cells, to evaluate the effect on human neurons. | These results indicate that both f5 and f5f3 effectively inhibited the deposition of extracellular Aβ in SH-SY5Y cells and that the inhibitory effect of f5f3 was similar to that of f5. | Discussion In this study, the EC50 values of 210 mushrooms were screened, and approximately 5 of them (i.e., 11 species) were found to have high Aβ42 aggregation inhibitory activity. | Next, based on the EC50 results, the EtOAc extract of t037 was selected and further purified through silica gel column chromatography and thin layer chromatography to evaluate the Aβ42 inhibitory activity of the extract. | After the first separation by silica gel column chromatography, f5 had the best inhibitory activity, which was 10 times higher than the crude extract (Figure 4A). | We further separated the compounds with high inhibitory activity in f5 using a second separation step by silica gel column chromatography, but the inhibitory activity of the extracts that were separated decreased (Figure 4A). | To verify the accuracy of this result, ThT was used to verify the Aβ inhibitory activities of the two extracts, f5 and f5f3, and the results were consistent with the MSHTS results (Supplementary Figure S1). | This shows that f5 has multiple active substances with Aβ inhibitory activity, and there is a synergistic effect between them. | Therefore, the Aβ inhibitory activity of f5 was higher than that of f5f3. | Currently, mushroom compounds with anti-AD potential are divided into several categories, including polysaccharides, steroid compounds, triterpenes, alkaloids, and phenols . | In this study, the inhibitory activity of 210 mushrooms collected in Hokkaido was evaluated against Aβ aggregation by using an automated MSHTS system. | We developed this system many years ago to label amyloid proteins with QD fluorescent probes, successfully elucidated the aggregation process of Aβ, tau, α-syn, and other proteins by recording images with real-time fluorescence microscopy, and depicted 3D models of aggregates in 3D images and to screen inhibitors . | In this study, as well as in actual screening results reported in our previous reports, the system can accurately and efficiently evaluate the inhibitory activity, even of crude extracts derived from natural products (plants, mushrooms), as well as various commercial dressings . | In summary, we believe that the MSHTS system will become an important method for detecting amyloid aggregation and screening amyloid aggregation inhibitors. | We will explore the ability of this system to screen amyloid inhibitors to develop therapeutic drugs for amyloid diseases and functional foods for the prevention of AD. | The EC50 of RA is 10.7 µgmL , a well-known Aβ aggregation inhibitor. | However, the activity decreased with further purification, so there may be a synergistic effect of multiple compounds that have not yet been elucidated. | It is also necessary to understand the interactions between the compounds in the fractions and the mechanisms of action on the organism, which will be the subject of the next phase of research. | Conclusions We successfully evaluated the Aβ aggregation inhibitory activity of 210 crude extracts of Hokkaido mushrooms using an automated MSHTS system. | Among them, 11 mushroom extracts had Aβ inhibitory activity, while 6 of them had neuroprotective effects and significantly increased PC12 cell viability. | After solvent separation and purification of two extracts, t037 and t100, the obtained extracts still had good inhibitory activity and neuroprotective properties. | In conclusion, our automated MSHTS system has great potential for screening AD inhibitors. | The Aβ inhibitory activity of f5 was higher than that of other mushrooms. | We hope that f5 may be used as a dietary supplement and Aβ inhibitor for the prevention of AD after multiple experiments.","Alzheimers (MISC), AD (MISC), A (MISC), AD (MISC), MS (MISC), A (MISC), Hokkaido (LOC), Japan (LOC), El (MISC), ##f (ORG), ##ving (PER), Fu (MISC), ##scopor (ORG), A (MISC), E (MISC), E

NO and sGC NO is important messaging molecule in almost all biological species and is the main physiological and pharmacological activator of cGMP synthesis by sGC. | In addition to NOS, NO can be generated in various redox reactions of certain nitrogen-containing compounds that are normally consumed or present in the body. | NO is readily interconverted in the body into nitrosonium (NO)-containing species, nitroxyl (NONHO), various complexes with transition metals, S-nitrosothiols (RSNO), and other compounds generally known as reactive nitrogen species (RNS) . | The synthesis of cGMP by apo-sGC can be activated NO-independently by protoporphyrin IX or various pharmacologically active compounds . | Pharmacological Agents Targeting the cGMP and NO Pathway Numerous classes of pharmacologically active compounds were developed to target multiple components of the cGMP and NO pathway and have been reviewed in recent publications (see and references therein). | The whole array of the compounds represents a good example of mechanism-based drug development. | Additional experimental compounds include RSNO that have their own biological effects or release NO enzymatically or in reaction with cysteine , diazenium compounds that are spontaneously decomposing to form NO , heterocyclic synthetic compounds that form NO in reactions with thiols or transition metals in the cells , and other types of compounds including hybrid drugs . | The suppression of NOS activity may be due to the lack of oxygen in hypoxia, excessive production of endogenous inhibitors similar to asymmetric dimethyl arginine , or oxidative stress associated with enzyme uncoupling. | These compounds preferentially activate heme-deficient apo-sGC and are thus useful to counteract the disruption of the NO and cGMP pathway caused by oxidative stress with an associated lack of NO and deficiency in heme-containing holo-sGC. | Non-specific inhibitors suppress the stimulation of cGMP synthesis by all guanylyl cyclases . | The membrane-bound enzyme neprilysin is the main protease responsible for the degradation of natriuretic peptides, and neprilysin inhibitors, e.g., sacubitril, may be used to increase the circulating levels of endogenous ANP and BNP and enhance cGMP production by GC-A . | Analogs of intestinal peptide hormones include linaclotide and plecanatide, which are efficient activators of GC-C . | Some of the effects of inhibitors of PDE3 (milrinone and cilostazol) and PDE1 (vinpocetine) are mediated by suppression of cGMP hydrolysis in addition to cAMP degradation . | The critical role of the pathway in early blastocyst development was initially established in mice by treatment of two-cell embryos in vitro with an inhibitor of NOS, an NO donor, an inhibitor of sGC, and a cell-permeable cGMP analog . | Treatment with NOS inhibitors was shown to markedly reduce the differentiation of stem cells into neurons, and this effect was blocked by the co-administration of the PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil. | In the case of the peripheral nervous system, a study in rats demonstrated that intrauterine exposure to a NOS inhibitor results in the abnormal development of sympathetic innervation and arteries in newborn animals . | Typically, mammalian ES cells are maintained on a supportive layer of feeder cells, and the cultures have to include some factors to prevent spontaneous differentiation, such as leukemia inhibitor factor for mouse ES cells or basic fibroblast growth factor for human ES cells . | The treatment of undifferentiated ES cells with low concentrations of an NO donor protects mouse ES cells from apoptosis induced by the removal of leukemia inhibitory factor, which is required for their normal growth in culture. | Moreover, the overexpression of eNOS in mouse ES cells represses the expression of differentiation genes induced by growth factor removal, while treatment with a NOS inhibitor reverses the effects of eNOS overexpression. | Moreover, at least some of the effects of ANP are suppressed by treatment of the cells with an inhibitor of PKGI . | The treatment of EB-derived outgrowth cultures with NO donors, activators of sGC, including BAY 41-2272, and their combinations significantly increases the expression levels of cardiac-specific progenitor markers and myocardial proteins . | The production of endogenous NO is essential for the commitment of ES cells because NOS inhibitors block this differentiation pathway, while the activation of endogenous NO production by stimulation of AMP-dependent protein kinase and the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway promotes the formation of cardiomyocyte precursors . | These effects were associated with an increase in the expression of eNOS and were blocked by an inhibitor of NOS and by scavengers of free radicals . | A comprehensive study in mouse stem cells without EB formation demonstrated that their release from pluripotency by the removal of leukemia inhibitory factor results in a subpopulation of cells that expresses various mesodermal markers and eventually serves as a source of cardiac progenitor cells. | In this case, the molecular mechanism includes an increase in the synthesis of NO by endogenous NOS, since the formation of the vascular structures induced by a mechanical stimulus is blocked by an inhibitor of NOS . | For example, the later stages of the differentiation of mouse ES cells into endothelial precursor cells are significantly inhibited by the treatment of ES cells with a non-specific NOS inhibitor, L-NAME . | For example, experimental and clinical data indicate that NO donors and inhibitors of PDE5 promote restorative processes in an ischemic brain after stroke by modulating the regenerative capacity of neuronal stem cells and other cell types involved in angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and oligodendrogenesis to improve the neurological function during subacute recovery from stroke . | Treatment with an NO donor protected the cells in a concentration-dependent manner, while this protective effect was blocked by co-treatment with an inhibitor of PKG. | It appears that the effects are sGC-specific because neither NOS inhibitors nor the activation of pGC with BNP had an effect on the cell viability . | A similar human model of ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes was used to study the inhibitory effects of NO, cGMP, and PKGI on hypertrophy induced by the treatment of fully differentiated cells with an α-adrenoreceptor agonist. | Interestingly, the treatment of obese cells with pravastatin, an inhibitor of isoprenoid and cholesterol biosynthesis, normalized the functional properties of the cells, and this effect was blocked by an inhibitor of NOS . | Treatment with an inhibitor of cGMP phosphodiesterase protects endothelial precursor cells formed during EB phase of mouse ES cell differentiation from damage induced by hyperoxic conditions, while an inhibitor of sGC activation by NO decreases vasculogenesis. | In a model of differentiation of cultured rat neural stem cells, chronic treatment with an nNOS-specific inhibitor significantly reduces the differentiation of stem cells into neurons while increasing the number of progenitor cells. | In this case, the mechanisms of NO effects are associated with metabolism of L-arginine and signaling by brain-derived neurotrophic factor . | It appears that the migration depends on NO signaling because inhibitors of nNOS, sGC, and PKG block this process while the treatment with an NO donor and a cell-permeable cGMP analog enhances the migration . | NO-stimulated synthesis of cGMP in adipose tissue-derived SCs has been shown to be the main mechanism of valproic acid-induced neuronal differentiation of these cells , which may be linked to the effects of histone deacetylase inhibitors that stimulate the expression of sGC . | The effects of irariin are significantly suppressed by the co-administration of the inhibitors of NOS and sGC . | In another system of cultured human skeletal stem cells, the inhibition of PKGI with the non-specific protein kinase inhibitor H-8 causes their differentiation to osteoblasts while having no effect on the differentiation into osteoclasts or adipocytes. | The treatment of these cells with a NOS inhibitor reverses the induction of stem cell markers and reduces anchorage-independent growth, thus promoting apoptosis . | A blockade of endogenous production of NO by iNOS in colon CSL cells by treatment with iNOS inhibitors or by knocking down iNOS expression was shown to reduce tumorigenicity of the cells in vitro and in vivo and to lower the expression of stem cell markers . | Recent in-depth analysis of colorectal CSL cells with highly tumorigenic self-renewing phenotype resistant to apoptosis suggested that various activators of intestinal guanylyl cyclase C, including the peptides linaclotide and plecanatide, may be considered an approach to elevate the intracellular levels of cGMP in CSL cells because of the known antitumor effects of this second messenger molecule . | The treatment of stem-like cells isolated from the prostate cancer cell line PC3 with inhibitors of PDE5 attenuates various factors contributing to the CSL properties of the cells apparently through the activation of PKG . | The treatment of these CSL cells with a combination of PDE5 inhibitor tadalafil and cisplatin produced stronger cytotoxic effect than that obtained by treatment with cisplatin alone, indicating that cGMP appears to interfere with the stemness and chemoresistance of CSL cells . | The inclusion of unstable S-nitrosoglutathione, an NO donor and sGC activator, in a hydrogel was shown to produce a more stable formulation that enhances cutaneous wound repair and re-epithelization and healing of ischemic wounds in the corresponding rat models .","GM (MISC)"

11640089.xml,JRM-28, a Novel HDAC2 Inhibitor, Upregulates Plasticity-Associated Proteins in Hippocampal Neurons and Enhances Morphological Plasticity via Activation of CREB: Implications for Alzheimer’s Disease,"One such compound, a novel histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) inhibitor named JRM-28, was shown here to enhance dendritic strength, augment spine density, and upregulate post-synaptic neurotransmission in hippocampal neurons. | By this mechanism, HDAC2 has been reported to suppress expressions of many neuroprotective molecules , including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the cellular homolog of v-FOS (c-FOS) proteins . | Structurally, macrocyclic HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) share common structural determinants, including a cap group, a linker, and a zinc-binding group (ZBG). | The inhibition of other HDAC isoforms by MJM-1 warranted the development of more selective and potent HDAC2 inhibitors. | The SDF (structure-data format) structure of compound JRM-28 for docking was generated by ChemDraw Professional (Version 16.0, PerkinElmer Informatics, Inc., 710 Bridgeport Avenue, Shelton, CT, USA). | Briefly, the test inhibitor solution in DMSO was made in such a way that the final DMSO concentration did not exceed 1. | Therefore, the application of selective HDAC2 inhibitors could have strong therapeutic implications in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. | However, due to the remarkable structural similarity of all class-I HDACs (HDAC123 and 8), a major drawback of currently available HDAC2 inhibitors is the limited specificity, as these pharmacophores target all class-I HDACs with variable efficiency . | Briefly, JRM-28 was synthesized by reacting triphenylmethyl mercaptan with acrolein via a conjugate addition reaction followed by a Witting reaction to afford compound 5 (Figure 1A). | As depicted previously , romidepsin, a potent HDAC inhibitor, displayed a strong HDAC inhibitory effect once its disulfide bond was reduced with DTT . | While analyzing the effect of JRM-28 on HDAC2 inhibition, we observed that the addition of DTT markedly increased the inhibitory effect of JRM-28 by almost 200-fold (Figure 2F). | Since, upon reduction, JRM-28 breaks down to JRM-28a and 28b, the HDAC2-inhibitory effect of each monomer is warranted. | We monitored the dose-dependent inhibitory effect of JRM-28b by reducing JRM-20 (Figure 2G). | Thus, it can be concluded that JRM-28a, but not 28b, is the most potent isoform that displays a strong HDAC2 inhibitory effect. | Collectively, our results suggest that JRM-28a, the active component of JRM-28, serves as a strong inhibitor of HDAC2 while showing relatively weaker inhibition of other HDACs. Next, JRM-28 in the presence of DTT was evaluated by cytotoxicity assays. | Taken together, our current study highlights the discovery of a novel HDAC2 inhibitor, JRM-28, and its potential role in inducing neuronal plasticity via activation of CREB. | However, the major challenge is the highly overlapping structural similarities of all class-I HDACs, which makes it difficult to identify a selective inhibitor of HDAC2. | In our current manuscript, we report the synthesis and characterization of a novel HDAC2 inhibitor termed JRM-28, followed by evaluating its effect in promoting morphological plasticity in hippocampal neurons. | JRM-28 is a macrocyclic compound, which is designed and synthesized to satisfy the structural determinants of a classical HDAC inhibitor with an N-methyl acetalide cap group, a lipophilic linker, and a sulfur-containing ZBG. | Both JRM-28a and 28b were evaluated for HDAC2 inhibition by luminescence and fluorimetric inhibitor screening strategies. | A dose-responsive ligand binding assay with purified HDAC2 revealed that JRM-28a was a stronger inhibitor (IC50 0.28 µM) of HDAC2 than JRM-28b (IC50 2.713 µM). | Moreover, a fluorimetric binding assay with purified HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC6, followed by the comparative analyses of IC50 values and Hill slopes of sigmoidal binding curves, further indicated that JRM-28a could be a selective inhibitor only for HDAC2, but not other HDACs. An in silico docking simulation study once more indicated that JRM-28a was strongly docked in the catalytic pocket of HDAC2, whereas weaker docking was observed while analyzing the interaction between JRM-28a and HDAC4, a class-II HDAC. | 4.2. JRM-28 Displays a Strong Neuroprotective Response by Inducing Morphological Plasticity in Neurons Before exploring the neuroprotective properties of JRM-28, different cellular assays confirmed that a 5 μM dose of JRM-28 significantly attenuated the activation of HDAC2 without causing any cell death. | In summary, the current literature highlights the discovery of a novel small molecular compound that selectively inhibits HDAC2 but not other HDACs. By inhibiting HDAC2, JRM-28 stimulated the transcriptional activity of CREB and subsequently augmented the downstream events of structural plasticity, including dendritic morphogenesis, spine maturation, and neurotransmission through ionotropic glutamate receptors.","Alzheimers (MISC), AD (MISC), 2 (MISC), HDAC2 (MISC), JRM (MISC), JRM (MISC), CR (MISC), NMDA (MISC), AM (MISC), G (MISC), JRM (MISC), NMDA (MISC), AMPA (MISC), JRM (MISC), NMDA (MISC), AM (MISC), CRE (ORG), JRM (MISC), JRM (MISC), i (MISC), AD (MISC)"

Hepatoprotective The liver hosts various physiological processes, including the breakdown of foreign compounds. | The metabolism of xenobiotics in the liver occurs in three phases intended to convert the molecules into more hydrophilic compounds facilitating their excretion. | A study compared the hepatoprotective effect of Opuntia robusta fruit extract (OR, rich in betacyanins, betaxanthins, flavonoids, and other phenolic compounds), betanin, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which is the currently used treatment, against diclofenac-induced acute liver injury. | SIRT1 activators significantly reduced oxidative stress and inflammation by inhibiting the NF-κB and enhancing the Nrf2 pathway, contributing to cytoprotective effects . | Because betalains are widely recognized for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, they have been studied as compounds with great potential in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (Table 7). | In a study using enhanced atomistic simulations to investigate the effects of astaxanthin, betanin, and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on Aβ peptide oligomers (dimer, trimer, tetramer), all three natural compounds inhibit Aβ aggregation by reducing aggregation-prone conformations. | The neuroprotective effects of indicaxanthin seem to derive primarily from its ability to regulate the redox-sensitive activation of the NF-κB and Nrf2 pathways and their associated downstream signaling mechanisms . | Preclinical studies highlight their neuroprotective potential in PD by improving dopaminergic neuron survival and in AD by reducing Aβ aggregation and associated toxicity. | These findings suggest that betalains and related natural compounds could serve as valuable adjunctive treatments in managing neurodegenerative diseases, warranting further investigation in clinical settings. | foods-13-03909-t007_Table 7 Table 7 Summary of neuroprotective mechanisms of betalains in various studies. | Betalains Source Major Compound Disease Model Mechanisms Reference Betanin (isolated compound) Betanin PD model: 6-OHDA and H2O2induced oxidative damage and apoptosis in PC12 cells ROS levels; modulation of SAPKJNK and PI3K pathways to cell survival Betanin (isolated compound) Betanin Rotenone-induced Parkinson-like mice model TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6; MDA; GSH; expression of TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB Betanin (isolated compounds) Betanin REMD simulations and Molecular Docking amyloid-beta aggregation Hylocereus polyrhizus betacyanins Anti-A β aggregation activity and citotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cell culture amyloid-beta aggregation and no citotoxicity Indicaxanthin (isolated compound) Indicaxan-thin High-fat diet-induced neuronal damage in mice expression of proapoptotic genes; expression of antiapoptotic genes; expression of neuroinflammatory genes and proteins; high-fat diet-induced oxidative stress : decreased, : increased. | The anticancer effects of betavulgarin, a compound isolated from beetroot, was explored specifically targeting breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), a subpopulation known for drug resistance, self-renewal, recurrence, and metastasis. | Juice from young shoots showed a stronger inhibitory effect on cancer cell proliferation, particularly in estrogen-dependent cells, and promoted both antiproliferative and apoptotic responses, pointing to the involvement of the internal apoptosis pathway . | Researchers tested betalain-rich extracts and purified compounds, finding that tryptophan-betaxanthin reduced tumor size by 56.4 and increased lifespan by 9.3. The antitumor activity was linked to the modulation of the DAF-16 transcription factor and the insulin signaling pathway . | Betalain Source Major Compound Disease Model Mechanisms Reference Betanin (isolated compound) Betanin Cancer cells Induction of apoptosis through mitochondria, activation of caspases, promotion of DNA fragmentation in cancer cells without affecting normal cells Beta vulgaris Betavulgarin Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) proliferation, migration, colony formation, mammosphere formation, CD44CD24- subpopulation, and self-renewal proteins (C-Myc, Nanog, Oct4) Beta vulgaris (young shootsroot) Betalains Breast cancer cells (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231) cancer cell proliferation, promoted antiproliferative and apoptotic responses, particularly in estrogen-dependent cells Betalain-rich extracts and compounds Tryptophan-betaxanthin Caenorhabditis elegans JK1466 mutants tumor size by 56.4, lifespan by 9.3, modulated DAF-16 transcription factor and insulin signaling pathway Beta vulgaris Chitosan nanoparticles Betalains and chitosan Human lung (A549), breast (T-47D), colorectal (Caco-2) carcinomas 8389 of cancer cells, induced apoptosis and necrosis, expression of apoptotic markers (Caspase 3, P53) Beta vulgaris (hydroalcoholic extract) Betanin Colorectal cancer (Caco-2, HT-29) cancer cell growth (IC50 64107 μgmL), expression of pro-apoptotic genes (BAD, Caspase-3, Caspase-8, Caspase-9, Fas-R), Bcl-2 Beta vulgaris (encapsulated in liposomes) Betanin Photodynamic therapy for cancer Enhanced photosynthetic effect, improved stability and effectiveness, interaction with Bcl-2 proteins to induce apoptosis : decreased, : increased, C-Myc: c-myelocytomatosis, Oct4: octamer-binding transcription factor 4. | After ingesting 500 g of cactus pear pulp, both compounds peaked in plasma concentration after 3 h. | Both compounds were undetectable in plasma after 12 h . | The long-term intake (6 weeks) of fermented beetroot juice by human volunteers showed that during juice consumption, native compounds and twelve betalain metabolites (decarboxylated and dehydrogenated) were found in the blood and urine of volunteers. | Encapsulation and adsorption techniques are promising alternatives to overcome these limitations and improve the stability of bioactive compounds . | Our review emphasizes several studies demonstrating the substantial capacity of these pigments through pharmacologicalnutraceutical mechanisms involved in the antioxidant response, anti-inflammatory, the control of dyslipidemia, glycemic regulation, the maintenance of cardiovascular health, liver protection, neuroprotection, and antitumor and antimicrobial activities (Figure 3). | Investigating synergistic effects with other bioactive compounds and elucidating precise mechanisms of action in humans is also critical.","Beta (MISC), H (MISC), ##oc (MISC), Amarant (ORG), Op (MISC), ##unt (ORG), Caryop (ORG), ##es (MISC)"
11640333.xml,The Emerging Roles of the Stress Epigenetic Reader LEDGF/p75 in Cancer Biology and Therapy Resistance: Mechanisms and Targeting Opportunities,"This has been particularly documented in cancer cells, where interactions between RNAPII and transcription factors, co-activators, co-repressors, epigenetic readers, and chromatin remodelers orchestrate changes in gene expression during cancer initiation, progression, and response to therapy . | The lens epithelium-derived growth factor protein of 75 kD (LEDGFp75) is a transcriptional co-activator of RNAPII . | LEDGFp75 Discovery LEDGFp75 was discovered in 1998 by Roeders group and during the process of characterizing the general transcription co-activator PC4, two novel human transcriptional co-activators derived from alternative splicing, p75 and p52, were identified which interacted with the PC4 and RNAPII subunits . | Around the same time, Tans group reported that the sequence of transcription co-activator p75 corresponded to the sequence of their recently identified DFS70 autoantigen . | They subsequently showed that the gene encoding the LEDGFp75 protein (aa 1530) also encodes a smaller alternative splice variant called LEDGFp52 (aa 1333), and sequence analysis revealed identity to the transcription co-activators p75 and p52 . | LEDGFp75 depletion leads to accumulation of R-loops and DNA damage at gene promoters or transcription start sites, increasing the sensitivity of PCa cells to the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor Olaparib and DNA damaging chemotherapeutic drugs such as etoposide . | Another transcription co-activator, TOX4, also interacts with the PWWP domain in the chromatin of cancer cells , although it remains to be established if this interaction modulates oncogenic gene expression. | Interestingly, LEDGFp75 depletion also led to reduced protein levels of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13 and nuclear proteasome activator PA28γ, suggesting a role in protein degradation events involved in the regulation of DDR signaling molecules . | LEDGFp75 Potential as Oncotherapeutic Target As discussed above, multiple studies using pre-clinical cancer cellular models have shown that genetic silencing of LEDGFp75 sensitizes cells to various classes of chemotherapeutic drugs including DNA damaging agents, PARP inhibitors, antimetabolites, and microtubule-stabilizing taxanes . | Currently, there are no specific LEDGFp75 small molecule inhibitors available that could be evaluated for their potential in cancer treatment. | However, recent intense efforts in identifying or designing inhibitors that interfere with the interaction between HIV-IN and the LEDGFp75 IBD promises to yield novel LEDGFp75-targeting compounds that could potentially be repurposed for cancer treatment. | Early work in this area from the groups of Neamati and Debyser identified N-acylhydrazones and hydrazines as potential compounds using LEDGFp75 IBD-pharmacophore models . | Some of these compounds inhibited the interaction between the LEDGFp75 IBD and the HIV-IN at low μM concentrations and showed significant cytotoxicity in human colon cancer cells , highlighting their potential as anti-cancer agents. | The development of LEDGINs (inhibitors of LEDGFp75IN interaction) began with structure-based drug design targeting this interaction, resulting in the identification of 2-(quinolin-3-yl) acetic acid compounds that inhibited HIV replication . | Several derivatives were designed based on this structure such as the LEDGINS-1,2,3, CX series compounds, and BI-series compounds that displayed varying IC50 values in their inhibition of the LEDGFp75IN interaction in vitro or viral replication . | The lead compound from these studies, 6d, inhibited the interaction efficiently by binding to the catalytic core domain of HIV-IN, which is critical for binding to the IBD. | In another study, cyclic peptide inhibitors that bind to the LEDGFp75 IBD were identified by phage display and showed the ability to inhibit the LEDGFp75 IBD-IN interaction in vitro. | These compounds were found to interact with HIV-IN at the IBD binding pocket and showed potent antiviral effects mediated by their competition with LEDGFp75, which would disrupt chromatin tethering of IN, and induction of conformational change in the IN dimer, which inhibits proper assembly of host DNA-IN complex . | conducted a rational-based design study to identify compounds that can bind to the PWWP domain of LEDGFp75 and inhibit its interaction with the epigenetic marker H3K36me23. | Further development of these compounds could yield compounds with high affinity and specificity that may prevent the binding of LEDGFp75 and its paralog HRP-2 to active chromatin in the context of treatment of HIVAIDS and cancer. | While none of these studies have yielded LEDGINs with specific binding to LEDGFp75 and ability to inhibit the biological functions of this protein, it is imperative to continue designing and characterizing next generation LEDGINs and other specific-LEDGFp75 PWWP or IBD inhibitors. | These inhibitors should be evaluated for their competition with PWWP interacting partners (e.g., H3K36me23, splicing factors, DNA repair proteins) or IBD partners (e.g., Menin, MLL1, JPO2) and their anti-cancer activities (e.g., inhibition of cell proliferation, survival, clonogenicity, migration, invasion, tumor growth, DNA repair, and resistance to therapy) in pre-clinical models of human cancers. | The goal will be to attenuate LEDGFp75-mediated tumor aggressiveness by using specific small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) of this protein, either alone or in combination with SMIs targeting other members of its transcriptional network (e.g., Menin, MLL1KMT2A, c-MYC, HRP-2) and standard chemotherapeutic drugs or radiation to circumvent therapy resistance (Figure 4). | Pre-clinical studies using patient-derived xenografts and organoids would be essential to provide critical insights beyond those obtained using cancer cell line models on the therapeutic effectiveness of these inhibitors prior to the initiation of clinical trials. | This will be critical to circumvent any potential adverse effects of these inhibitors.","LED (ORG), LED (ORG), LED (ORG), RNA polymerase II (MISC), RNAPII

Preparation of Reaction Flavor Solution (RFS) for the Processing of Green Laver Chip Products In this experiment, to mask the off-flavor of the green laver itself and improve the flavor, free amino acids and monosaccharides were selected as reaction flavor-inducing precursors, and their content ranges were selected through preliminary experiments to generate pyrazines with nutty odors and sulfur-containing compounds with meat-like odors . | In total, 58 volatile flavor components were detected and identified as the following groups: 19 aldehydes, 18 N-containing compounds, 13 ketones, 4 S-containing compounds, 2 alcohols, and 2 aromatic hydrocarbons. | However, N-containing compounds in RFS were the most numerous with 5 compounds, followed by aldehydes (4), S-containing compounds (3), and ketones (3), while in GLC, there were 16 aldehydes, 8 ketones, and 3 alcohols. | These carbonyl compounds accounted for most of the identified compounds (29). | On the other hand, in GLCR, N-containing compounds were detected the most, with 15 compounds, followed by aldehydes and ketones, with 5 compounds each. | These compounds are known to be produced by lipid oxidation or autoxidation of unsaturated fatty acids and are mainly associated with food odors such as green, painty, beany, and rancid . | While only 2-isoamyl-6-methylpyrazine was detected in GLC, 15 N-containing compounds were detected in GLCR, most of which were alkylpyrazines with sweet, corn-like, and nutty odors, and 2-acetylpyrrole with popcorn-like odors were identified . | These compounds, like aldehydes, are a type of fatty acid oxidation decomposition product that contributes to floral and fruity odors in crustaceans . | Instead, α- and β-ionone compounds (violet odor), known to be thermally decomposed from carotenoid pigments , and geranylacetone, a monoterpene substance (rose, floral odor) , were detected. | In S-containing compounds, two straight-chain alkyl sulfides (dimethyl disulfide and dimethyl trisulfide), with soy sauce, fresh garlic, and cooked cabbage-like odors, and a heterocyclic compound, benzothiazole (nutty, popcorn odor), were detected only in RFS . | These alkyl sulfides are thought to be generated from methionine, a reaction flavor-inducing precursor, via methional, and are believed to be key flavor compounds in green laver chips because their thresholds are very low at 12 ngg and 0.01 ngg, respectively . | Based on the results above, it is thought that the alkylpyrazines produced in large amounts in GLCR were formed when the reaction flavor compounds of RFS interacted with the aldehydes abundant in GLC during the heating process with the air fryer, ultimately reducing aldehydes and producing relatively large amounts of pyrazines. | It is also believed that these compounds play a significant role in the flavor of GLCR. | The analysis revealed that the reaction flavor compounds in RFS interacted with existing aldehydes in green laver chips (GLC) during air-frying, reducing aldehydes and increasing pyrazine production, significantly influencing the flavor profile of GLCR.","C (MISC), C (MISC)"

Network Pharmacology-Based Analysis All identified compounds were converted to SMILES structures using the PubChem database (https:pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov (accessed on 28 November 2024)). | The Swiss Target Prediction database was employed to retrieve potential targets for these compounds. | 2.8. Molecular Docking Based on the selected optimal targets, the active compounds most related to these targets were identified, and molecular docking analysis was conducted to assess the binding ability of the active compounds to the key targets. | Similarly, small molecules were preprocessed in AutoDockTools 1.5.7, involving operations such as Choose Root, Detect Root, Show Root Expansion, and Choose Torsions, and were saved in PDBQT format. | 2.9. Western Blot Assay Proteins were extracted from cells using RIPA lysis buffer containing a protease inhibitor cocktail and 0.1 Triton X-100. | When the processing concentration is 0.25 mgmL, the pericarp extract exhibits notable inhibitory effects on breast cancer cells. | Consequently, identifying the distinct compounds present in each extract may enhance the anti-tumor activity of pericarp extracts. | The analytical process, supported by Compound Discoverer 3.3, GNPS database consultation, and existing literature, identified 122 compounds across the pericarp and seeds. | These compounds include 39 alkaloids, 23 flavonoids, 19 organic acids, 7 coumarins, 8 esters, 6 phenols, 4 phenylpropanoids, 5 sugars, 2 ketones, 5 terpenoids, 2 ethers, 1 alcohol, and 1 aldehyde. | Detailed compound information is presented in Tables S1 and S2, and the ion current diagrams are shown in Figure 2A,B. | A comparative analysis revealed 85 compounds in the pericarp, with alkaloids (20) and flavonoids (20) being notably prevalent, along with organic acids (13), esters (7), and a miscellaneous group of 25 other types. | In contrast, the seeds contained 69 compounds, primarily alkaloids (31), followed by organic acids (12), flavonoids (7), coumarins (4), and a group of 15 other types. | This comparison highlights a shared chemical signature of 32 compounds across both tissues, including a significant overlap in alkaloids (13) and organic acids (6), suggesting a potential common biosynthetic pathway or functional role. | The shared compounds also include flavonoids (4), esters (3), sugars (2), alcohol, phenol, coumarin, and a terpenoid, indicating a complex interplay of biochemical processes within Wampee. | A total of 32 shared compounds, accounting for approximately 26.23 of the total identified components (as shown in Figure 2C), suggest a degree of biochemical unity between the pericarp and seeds. | However, as indicated in Figure 2D, there are significant differences in the major metabolites of the pericarp and seeds of Wampee, with the distinct distribution of certain compounds highlighting their specific functional roles. | 3.3. The Fragmentation Pattern of the Identified Compounds The mass spectrometry fragmentation patterns obtained through collision-induced dissociation (CID) provide accurate identification of compound structures and offer insights into their potential cleavage pathways. | This approach serves as a valuable reference for the mass spectrometric identification of compounds in the Wampee pericarp. | By analyzing the fragmentation behavior of key compounds, we can identify characteristic fragment ions that not only assist in structural elucidation but also provide molecular signatures for differentiating various compounds. | 3.3.1. Alkaloids Compounds Alkaloids are one of the main classes of compounds found in Wampee. | A total of 39 alkaloids were identified in the pericarp and seeds, with nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds constituting a significant portion. | The quasi-molecular ion peak of compound 38 was observed at mz 231.11293 , corresponding to the molecular formula C13H14N2O2, as determined using Xcalibur 4.0 software. | Therefore, compound 38 was identified as 1,2,3,4-Tetrahydro-3-carboxyharmane. | The fragment ion at mz 130.06506, due to its potential stability from rearrangement, may serve as a characteristic ion for identifying this compound. | For compound 67, the quasi-molecular ion peak was detected at mz 240.06677 , with a molecular formula of C14H11NO3, as fitted by Xcalibur 4.0 software. | Comparing these results with the reference , the data are consistent with the known compound 1,3-dihydroxy-N-methylacridone. | 3.3.2. Flavonoid Compounds Flavonoids are one of the main classes of compounds found in Wampee, with 23 flavonoids identified. | The fragmentation of flavonoids often occurs through the Retro-Diels-Alder (RDA) reaction on the C ring or by the loss of neutral small molecules or groups, such as H2O, CH3, and CO, producing various secondary fragments. | The quasi-molecular ion peak of compound 59 was detected at mz 317.06570 , corresponding to the molecular formula C16H12O7, as determined by Xcalibur 4.0 software. | Thus, compound 59 was identified as Isorhamnetin. | Additionally, the secondary fragments generated at different positions of the C ring, such as mz 274.04837 and mz 245.04790, may serve as characteristic ions for identifying this compound. | For compound 65, the quasi-molecular ion peak was observed at mz 361.09155 , corresponding to the molecular formula C18H16O8, as determined by Xcalibur 4.0 software. | According to the reference , the quasi-molecular ion peak of Centaureidin was observed at mz 361.091, with secondary fragments at mz 345.063, 328.058, 303.051, and 285.039, consistent with the identified compound. | Furthermore, the secondary fragments generated at different positions of the C ring, such as mz 165.05428 and mz 183.02888, may serve as characteristic ions for identifying this compound. | 3.3.3.

11640457.xml,Construction, structural modification, and bioactivity evaluation of pentacyclic triterpenoid privileged scaffolds in active natural products,"In recent years, researchers have developed a series of derivatives with enhanced biological activities and improved drug properties through structural modifications of these compounds, particularly achieving notable progress in the field of antitumor therapy. | Terpenoids are a class of compounds and their derivatives with a molecular scaffold based on isoprene units, which are widely distributed in nature. | Oleanane-type triterpenoids exhibit extensive pharmacological activity; OA is commonly used clinically for its hepatoprotective effects,13 while glycyrrhizin-based formulations have been marketed for the treatment of hepatitis.4 The oleanane-type, also known as the β-amyrane-type, includes compounds such as β-amyrin, germanicol, OA, and GA. | Lupane-type compounds mainly include lupeol, betulin, BA, and their derivatives. | The ursane-type, also known as the α-amyrane-type, includes compounds such as α-amyrin, UA, and taraxasterol. | These scaffolds undergo chemical modifications, such as oxidation, substitution, and glycosylation, through the action of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases and glycosyltransferases, with uridine diphosphate (UDP) as the glycosyl donor, ultimately forming various pentacyclic triterpenoid compounds. | 2 Structural modification of pentacyclic triterpenoid compounds In the structure of pentacyclic triterpenoids, the modifications of OA, BA, and UA primarily occur at the hydroxyl group on the A-ring, the carboxyl group at the C-28 position, and the double bond on the C-ring. | Rational structural modifications of these active groups can significantly enhance the antitumor activity of these compounds. | 2.1 Salt formation modification Based on the structural characteristics of pentacyclic triterpenoid compounds, there are three direct methods of salt formation: carboxyl groups

both carboxyl and hydroxyl polar groups in their structure, coupling amino acids with pentacyclic triterpenoid compounds can enhance the water solubility of the drug and improve its bioavailability. | Zhang et al.19 introduced amino acids at the C-28 position of OA, and the resulting OA derivatives exhibited significantly higher antitumor activity compared to the parent compound. | 2.3

induced higher levels of NO and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in paclitaxel-resistant A549Taxol cells with overexpression of glutathione S-transferase π (GSTπ), significantly inhibiting cell proliferation (IC50 0.349 0.051 μmol L1). | Moreover, compound 44 showed stronger inhibition of Lon protease expression, as well as more pronounced induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in A549Taxol cells, compared to CDDO-Me.

results, the structureactivity relationship of the compounds was discussed. | Hemagglutination inhibition and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis suggested that compound 52 may interfere with viral invasion by interacting with the HA protein of the influenza virus. | The most active derivative (compound 53, Fig. | Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays and docking studies suggested that these derivatives likely share the same mechanism as their parent compound, blocking viral entry by binding to hemagglutinin (HA) and preventing the interaction between the viral HA protein and the sialic acid receptors on host cells. | In the same year, Medina-ODonnell et al.54 esterified one or two amino acids at the C-28 position and substituted phthaloyl groups at the C-3 position to obtain

revealed that compounds 80a, 80c, and 80e exhibited significant inhibitory effects on human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) and lung cancer cells (A549). | Notably, compound 80a demonstrated a significantly enhanced inhibitory capacity against breast cancer cells compared to glycyrrhetinic acid, with an IC50 of 4.29 0.07 μmol L1. | The activity testing results of compounds 80a, 80c, and 80e

of the ursane-type pentacyclic triterpenoids. | Young et al.75 reported that UA can induce the differentiation of teratoma stem cells, demonstrating its anti-carcinogenic properties, and has been recognized as one of the most promising natural compounds for cancer prevention. | 6.1 Structural modifications of ursolic acid and antitumor activity 6.1.1 Structural modifications of ursolic acid at the C-3 and C-28 positions Zhang Dajun et al.77 synthesized benzyl phosphonic acid diethyl ester acetamide derivatives of UA (compounds 111115, Fig. | The in vitro anti-hepatocellular activity of the target compounds was evaluated using the MTT assay. | All target compounds exhibited low cytotoxicity against normal human liver cells (L02), while compound 115 demonstrated significant antiproliferative activity against HepG2 cells, with an IC50 value of 2.69 μmol L1, showing good selectivity between tumor cells and normal cells. | Spivak et al.33 designed and synthesized guanidine-containing UA derivatives (compound 118, Fig. | The derivatives with the highest activity (compounds 120 and 122, Fig. | UA-4a and UA-8a showed significant inhibitory activity against all

introduction of diamine compounds at the C-3 and C-28 positions, both displaying strong antitumor properties. | Furthermore, analysis of the synthesized series suggested that the carbon chain length of the diamine compounds had little impact on antitumor activity, and no linear correlation was observed. | Considering factors such as ease of isolation, purification, yield, and activity during synthesis, the diamine compounds with a two-carbon chain were deemed the most valuable for further research. | These compounds were characterized by low synthesis cost, easy purification, simple synthetic steps, and high cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines, making them promising candidates for further study as novel antitumor drugs. | For example, compound 123 (Fig. | Zhao et al.82 carried out structural modifications on the A and C rings of UA, as exemplified by compound 125 (Fig. | The resulting compounds exhibited cytotoxicity against cancer cells such as KB and PC-3, comparable to cisplatin, and demonstrated an inhibitory effect on α-glucosidase that was an order of magnitude stronger than that of acarbose. | Modifications in these positions have been shown to impact the compounds pharmacological properties, particularly its anticancer effects. | Wu et al.83 designed and synthesized a series of UA derivatives containing an aminoguanidine structure and evaluated their activity as HIF-1α inhibitors and anticancer agents. | Using a luciferase reporter gene assay based on Hep3B cells, most compounds exhibited good HIF-1α inhibitory activity. | Among them, the most active derivative (compound 128, Fig. | Wang et al.84 synthesized derivatives of UA with a furan moiety at the C-2 and C-3 positions based on the method of Khan (compound 130, Fig. | These derivatives were further modified by conjugation with ethyl-piperazine to obtain piperidine-containing derivatives (compound 131, Fig. | The anti-proliferative activities of the target compounds against the HeLa and MKN45 cancer cell lines were evaluated using the MTT assay, with cisplatin and UA used as positive controls. | Min et al.85 reported that the 3-O-acyl derivatives of ursolic acid (compounds 132142, Fig. | 40) exhibited significant inhibitory effects on HIV replication in human T lymphocytes (H9 cells), with IC50 values of 0.31 and 2.1 μmol L1, respectively. | Compared to the lead compound ursolic acid (IC50 value of 4.4 μmol L1), these two compounds demonstrated improved anti-HIV activity and safety profiles. | Analysis of the IC50 values revealed that, when introducing anhydride chains containing up to six carbons, the anti-HIV activity of the compounds increased with the number of carbon atoms. | Additionally, when the carboxyl groups of the anhydride formed carboxylic acid methyl esters, the anti-HIV activity of the compounds decreased, and in some cases, was completely lost. | Activity assays indicated that compounds 143a and 143b, which contain phthalate esters or isophthalate esters, exhibited moderate inhibitory effects on cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), while the inhibitory effect of derivative 143c, containing terephthalate esters, was completely lost. | Further comparison of derivatives 143b, 143d, and 143e revealed that the carboxyl group on the backbone chain is essential for enhancing inhibitory activity. | In contrast to derivative 143g, the derivatives containing succinate esters (143j and 143k) lost their inhibitory effects on CETP, possibly due to steric hindrance from the methyl group. | Derivative 143l, which contains 1,2-cyclopropanedicarboxylate esters, exhibited the strongest CETP inhibitory activity, with an IC50 of 2.4 μmol L1. | The presence of a carboxyl group at the end of the backbone chain and the length of the backbone chain are critical factors for maintaining or enhancing CETP inhibitory activity. | These types of 3-β ester triterpenoid derivatives (e.g., derivative 143l) hold promise as lead compounds with potent CETP enzyme inhibitory activity. | Xu et al.87 found that glycosylated corosolic acid derivatives possess certain α-glucosidase inhibitory activity and improved water solubility, which is associated with the presence of hydroxyl groups at the C-2 and C-3 positions. | 7 Structural modifications and pharmacological activities of celastrol Celastrol, also known as tripterine, is a triterpenoid compound belonging to the oleanane-type pentacyclic triterpenoids. | It was first extracted from the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Tripterygium wilfordii by the renowned organic chemist Zhao Chenggu in 1936.90 As the first active compound isolated from the root bark of Tripterygium wilfordii, celastrol is the most abundant bioactive component in this plant and has been demonstrated to exhibit potent anticancer activity.91 Compared to some conventional chemotherapeutic agents, celastrol shows similar or even superior anticancer effects, particularly against multidrug-resistant cancer cells. | In 2007, it was listed by Cell magazine as one of the five natural products most likely to be developed into modern pharmaceuticals.92 Despite extensive research into its potential anticancer properties, its further application remains limited due to challenges such as poor water solubility, low bioavailability, and high toxicity.93 7.1 Structural modifications of celastrol at the C-29 position and its anticancer activity Feng et al.94 modified the hydroxyl group at C-3 and the carboxyl group at C-29 of celastrol to synthesize a series of 1,2,3-triazole derivatives of celastrol (compound 145, Fig. | Among these, compound 145 demonstrated the highest anti-proliferative activity in the U251 cell line, with an IC50 of 0.94 μmol L1. | Ferulic acid (FA) is a type of phenolic acid that has been demonstrated to possess various pharmacological activities, including antioxidant, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. | Among these, the most active derivative (compound 146, Fig. | 43) exhibited the strongest inhibitory capacity. | Mechanistic studies revealed that compound 146 could disrupt the heat shock protein Hsp90Cdc37 complex while also inducing abnormal regulation of heat shock protein (Hsp90) receptors (p-Akt and Cdk4), leading to concentration-dependent cell cycle arrest in the G0G1 phase. | SAR studies revealed that the length of the linker significantly influenced the activity of the compounds. | Among the three-amine substitutions, introducing electron-donating groups onto the phenyl ring enhanced the antiproliferative activity of the compounds. | One particularly active derivative (compound 147, Fig. | Further mechanistic studies indicated that compound 147 could reduce the expression of the Hsp90Cdc37 complex in A549 cells and form a complex with Cdc37 in tumor cells, thereby disrupting the Hsp90Cdc37 interaction. | SAR analysis revealed that most compounds exhibited stronger antiproliferative activity compared to celastrol. | Additionally, no significant differences in activity were observed between the two series of compounds with different linker chains. | However, the celastrol derivative bearing a 3,4,5-trimethoxy cinnamoylamine side chain (compound 148, Fig. | Further pharmacological tests indicated that compound 148 significantly inhibited the colony formation ability of tumor cells, reduced the number of tumor spheres, and decreased the percentage of ovarian CSCs. Fig. | The results showed that the most active derivative (compound 149, Fig. | 46) released the highest levels of NO in vitro and exhibited greater antiproliferative activity compared to other compounds (A549: IC50 0.48 μmol L1). | Additional pharmacological studies revealed that compound 149 could induce dysregulation of the Hsp90 receptor, apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest at the G0G1 phase. | Among these, the most active derivative (compound 150, Fig. | Preliminary studies on its mechanism of action indicated that compound 150 induces apoptosis through the activation of cysteine protease-8 (caspase-8) and cysteine protease-3 (caspase-3), as well as the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) via an extrinsic pathway. | Among these derivatives, compound 152 (Fig. | Further experimental results revealed that, in nude mice bearing human colorectal cancer xenografts, compound 152 effectively inhibited the growth of Colo205 xenografts in vivo and exhibited better safety profiles compared to celastrol. | 8 Conclusion Natural products, as an important source of lead compounds for drug development, play a crucial role in pharmaceutical research. | Among these, pentacyclic triterpenes have garnered growing attention due to their diverse biological activities, with research on these compounds becoming progressively more in-depth in recent years.",""

11640500.xml,Impact of Physical Activity on Cellular Metabolism Across Both Neurodegenerative and General Neurological Conditions: A Narrative Review,"This filtering process ensured that the studies included in this review adhered to high methodological standards and focused on the specific aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular metabolism, and the relevant neuroprotective effects of exercise, focusing on specific neurological diseases impacted by cellular metabolism and physical activity. | Upon activation, AMPK initiates a cascade of events aimed at activating PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha), a pivotal protein in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis . | PGC-1α is a transcriptional coactivator that regulates the expression of several genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis . | This decreased activity results in a reduction in the production of malonyl-CoA, an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I). | This process is driven by the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), a master regulator of mitochondrial gene expression . | This coactivator also plays a crucial role in the regulation of oxidative metabolism, particularly in terms of balancing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and maintaining cellular redox homeostasis . | Furthermore, the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinsons disease extends beyond the direct effects on neuronal survival. | For example, leptin, which is produced by adipose tissue, has neuroprotective effects and can enhance synaptic plasticity. | Additionally, there was an increase in the expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and other synaptic proteins, which improved synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis in the hippocampus . | The researchers observed that exercise increased the density of dopaminergic terminals and ameliorated motor deficits, indicating a neuroprotective effect . | Furthermore, the combination of physical activity with nutritional strategies aimed at improving mitochondrial healthsuch as diets rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compoundsmay offer a more comprehensive approach to managing AD . | For example, compounds that boost the activity of PGC-1α, a transcriptional coactivator that regulates mitochondrial biogenesis, have been shown to protect dopaminergic neurons by promoting the generation of new, healthy mitochondria . | Additionally, combining physical activity with nutritional interventions aimed at supporting mitochondrial health, such as diets rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds, may offer a comprehensive approach to managing PD . | These improvements are thought to be mediated by the neuroprotective effects of exercise, which include not only enhanced mitochondrial function but also improved synaptic plasticity, reduced neuroinflammation, and better myelin repair. | The upregulation of PGC-1α and other exercise-induced signaling pathways contributes to these beneficial outcomes by supporting neuronal survival and function in the face of the metabolic challenges posed by Multiple Sclerosis. | Adipose tissue releases fatty acids into the blood, providing an alternative energy source for muscles and aiding in fat loss and improved body composition; the brain responds to exercise by improving cognition and neuroprotection, enhancing focus, reducing risks of neurodegenerative diseases , and supporting learning and adaptation. | Regular exercise likely safeguards against neurodegenerative diseases through both the enhancement of antioxidative stress defenses and associated advantageous mitochondrial adaptations, as well as indirectly, by modulating neuroprotective factors, such as the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) via reactive oxygen species (ROS) . | Additionally, Cheng and colleagues reported that the BDNF activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1α), leading to enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and a concomitant rise in cellular energy substrates, including ATP and NAD, alongside the preservation and formation of synapses . | also emphasized recently the neuroprotective function of irisin, a myokine derived from the proteolytic cleavage of the fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5) transmembrane protein, showing the evidence that physical exercise may serve as a preventive and therapeutic approach to cognitive decline in Alzheimers disease . | Nonetheless, it is evident that the potentially neuroprotective effects of exercise-induced signals to the brain contribute to the enhanced or sustained brain function, including improved cognitive abilities linked to the hippocampus and the increased resilience of hypothalamic neurons responsible for the hormonal regulation of hunger and satiety against the adverse effects of a high-fat diet . | It has been shown that exercise stimulates the release of neurotrophic factors linked to neuronal plasticity and neurogenesis . | Lactate, a paradigm within the framework of physical exercise, may be responsible for activating the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or abrineurin expression during physical activity, thereby enhancing learning capacity and memory skills . | These programs should not only aim to delay disease progression but also enhance neuroprotective mechanisms through improved mitochondrial dynamics and cellular resilience.","Alzheimers (MISC), Parkinsons (MISC), Multiple Sclerosis (MISC)"

Antimicrobial Activity of Extracts from Seeds The in vitro antimicrobial activity tests of extracts from seeds were performed using a broth microdilution method in 96-well microtitrate plates, according the recommended method of the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) and our previously published method , allowing for the estimation of three parameters: MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) and MBC (minimum bactericidal concentration) or MFC (minimum fungicidal concentration). | Namely, higher temperatures used for SXE increase the diffusion of extractable compounds improving mass transfer . | The choice of solvent significantly impacted the extraction efficiency and composition of the extracts, demonstrating the importance of solvent polarity in targeting specific bioactive compounds. | This suggests that the addition of water likely limited the solubility of certain hydrophobic compounds present in these seeds, reducing the overall yield. | These findings suggest that chamomile seeds contain more water-soluble bioactive compounds, which are more efficiently extracted using a solvent mixture with higher polarity. | This divergence in extract recovery demonstrates that solvent selection plays a critical role in optimizing the extraction of bioactive compounds and highlights the necessity of tailoring extraction methods based on the specific chemical composition of each plant seed. | Additionally, using green solvents like aqueous ethanol aligns with the principles of sustainable chemistry, as it reduces the reliance on pure organic solvents while enhancing the extraction of hydrophilic compounds, further promoting eco-friendly extraction processes. | It can be seen (Figure 1) that after the removal of oil using sc-CO2, the remaining waste seeds contain a significant number of extractable compounds. | The oils isolated from all tested seeds by SFE contained relatively low concentrations of phenolic compounds (up to 37.9 mg GAEg). | This observation can be attributed to the non-polar nature of sc-CO2 that favors the extraction of non-polar substances like oils, but it is limited in its ability to recover more polar bioactive compounds such as phenolics. | These solvents exhibited a greater affinity for polar compounds located in the seed matrices, leading to significantly higher TPC in the resulting extracts compared to oils obtained by sc-CO2. | This demonstrates the importance of selecting appropriate extraction methods and solvents based on the target compounds chemical properties. | Ethanol effectively disrupts the interactions between phenolic compounds and plant matrices, allowing for easier extraction, while water promotes the swelling of plant cells, which in addition facilitates the diffusion of these compounds . | However, pure water is generally ineffective as a solvent for phenolics, as many phenolic compounds exhibit higher solubility in less polar organic solvents . | In contrast, binary solvent systems (such as EtOHH2O) provide a synergistic effect, yielding higher concentrations of phenolic and flavonoid compounds in extracts compared to using mono-solvent systems like absolute ethanol or water alone . | For instance, the substantial increase in phenolic content in milk thistle extracts evident in the TPC spike observed in Figure 2b (regardless of a decrease in extraction yield seen in Figure 1b) is likely a result of the selective solubility of phenolic compounds in the aqueous ethanol used during SXE and USE. | noted, the aqueous ethanol (especially 50 concentration) was optimal for extracting silymarin, a key phenolic compound found in milk thistle. | The elevated temperatures used during SXE can improve the permeability of plant cell walls and break the interactions between phenolic compounds and macromolecules, such as proteins and polysaccharides. | This process facilitates the release and recovery of phenolic compounds into the extracts . | This process enhances solvent penetration into the plant matrix and accelerates the mass transfer of bioactive compounds, which theoretically should result in a more efficient extraction process, especially for thermally sensitive compounds that may degrade under the higher temperatures used in SXE. | The differing results between the current study and previous research underscore the importance of plant material type, specific compound interactions, and process conditions. | While SXE proves effective for phenolic recovery in the seeds studied here, USE offers advantages in cases where milder conditions are necessary for preserving delicate compounds. | Phenolic and flavonoid compounds are well known for their diverse physiological activities, including antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, cardiovascular, and neuroprotective effects . | This suggests that the phenolic and flavonoid compounds in the dandelion

11640963.xml,Non-Categorical Analyses Identify Rotenone-Induced ‘Parkinsonian’ Rats Benefiting from Nano-Emulsified Punicic Acid (Nano-PSO) in a Phenotypically Diverse Population: Implications for Translational Neurodegenerative Therapies,"Introduction An active area of research in neuropharmacology seeks to identify natural compounds that can be used to treat common neurodegenerative diseases. | Despite variations, the analysis of phenotype variance and similarity allowed us to identify ROT-treated rats with varying degrees of benefit from consuming Nano-PSO, whether it was used as a neuroprotective or neurorestorative agent. | Our objective was to identify rats that might benefit from the consumption of Nano-PSO, used as a neuroprotective or neurorestorative agent, when it was administered before or after receiving ROT, even if such benefits were inconsistently observed in a heterogeneous population of rats. | The degree of neuroprotection achieved varied significantly among rats, with only some displaying nearly normal MoPs. Interestingly, while intact rats performed similarly across both tests, some neuro-protected and neuro-restored rats showed better performance in the first test, while others improved in the second test, as indicated by the orientation of the ellipses in the PCA dimensional space. | The degree of neuroprotection varies among rats, with none maintaining MrPs close to normal values. | Additionally, neuroprotection is not homogeneous; in some rats, it progresses better in the left SNpc than in the right, while in others, the opposite occurs. | The relative neuroprotective effect of Nano-PSO was, however, insufficient to reinstate MrP variability in the population of neuro-protected rats. | The combined results suggest that Nano-PSO provides some degree of neuroprotection, although its extent is insufficient to maintain normal dopaminergic neuron numbers. | Overall, these results suggest that Nano-PSO offers neuroprotection and neuro-restoration against α-syn accumulation in the CaNu and SNpc. | In addition, the effects of ROT toxicity, neuroprotection, and neuro-restorationmonitored through α-syn availabilitydemonstrate individual regionalization. | These combined results indicate that while Nano-PSO provides some degree of neuroprotection and neuro-restoration, this is insufficient to maintain normal levels of α-syn availability. | For both SNpc and CaNu DPs, the extent of neuro-restoration and neuroprotection showed individual variability. | Although the results suggest that Nano-PSO provides some degree of neuro-restoration and, to a lesser extent, neuroprotection, the level of improvement achieved is insufficient to maintain DPs within the normal range. | The degree of neuro-restoration and neuroprotection was moderate, although it varied among individuals. | The observation that neuro-protected, neuro-restored, and intact rats cluster distinctly from ROT-administered rats suggests that Nano-PSO exerts neuroprotective and neuro-restorative effects. | While the results suggest that Nano-PSO provides some degree of neuro-restoration and, to a lesser extent, neuroprotection, the overall improvement achieved is insufficient to maintain the TPs within the normal range. | These results support the theory that Nano-PSO provides some degree of neuroprotection and neuro-restoration; the effect, nonetheless, varies notably across specimens individually. | Despite the extensive overlapping of GTCPs, Nano-PSO provides some degree of neuroprotection and neuro-restoration, the effects being remarkably individually variable. | Discussion The search for natural compounds to prevent, slow down, attenuate, or reverse neurodegenerative processes is a constant task in neuropharmacology (e.g., ). | To address the technical limitations of conducting a longitudinal study while enabling inter-individual comparisons, we devised a series of phenotypes and profiles as biomarkers to assess the relative deterioration, neuroprotection, or neuro-restoration effect following ROT administration, with or without Nano-PSO supplementation. | Nevertheless, it was consistently possible to identify ROT-treated rats that benefited from Nano-PSO supplementation, whether it was used as a neuroprotective or neurorestorative agent. | Indeed, Nano-PSO provides neuroprotection or neuro-restoration to varying degrees, depending on each individuals response to the supplementation and the parameters used to monitor their improvement or deterioration. | Considering the phenotypic variability in the neurodegeneration landscape and the individuality that characterizes the natural history of these diseases, the non-categorical interpretation of both basic and clinical studies may expedite the identification of new compounds that could benefit the distinct phenotypes of those patients who are already experiencing neurodegeneration and those susceptible to developing it . | In our experiments, although ROT administration tended to reduce phenotype variation among the rat population, Nano-PSO increased it, whether being employed as a neurorestorative or a neuroprotective agent. | Moreover, the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and pharmaco-(epi)genetics of Nano-PSO (and ROT) must be elucidated to better understand the mechanisms involved in the responses (and their diversity) of the brain and body to both compounds. | Nano-PSO (GranaGardTM, Granalix Bio Technologies, Ltd., Jerusalem, Israel) was administered orally daily (910 a.m.) using a syringe, with the intention to provide either neuroprotection (Nano-PSOROT) or neuro-restoration (ROTNano-PSO). | The samples (25 mg) were sonicated (20 Hz; 3 times1 min each at 4 C) in 100 µL of PBS (0.02 M; pH 7.4), supplemented with the complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Cat. | Then, the CaNu and SNpc samples were dissected under microscopic guidance, rinsed in PBS (0.02 M; pH 7.2), weighed, put into a centrifuge tube, and sonicated (25 mg) in radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer (25 mM TrisHCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 NP-40, 0.25 Na-deoxycholate, 1 mM and SDS 0.1) supplemented with the complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Cat. | Conclusions This study shows that non-categorical methods of data analysis, in particular PCA and HCDA, can be used to identify and select ROT-administered rats that could benefit from the continuous consumption of Nano-PSO, even when the neuroprotective or neuro-restoring response is far from categorical across the population, irrespective of the biomarker used to monitor disease progression.","Nano (MISC), Nano (MISC), Nano (MISC)"
11640972.xml,Redefining Roles: A Paradigm Shift in Tryptophan–Kynurenine Metabolism for Innovative Clinical Applications,"Traditionally, these metabolites have been categorized into distinct, often opposing groups, such as pro-oxidant versus antioxidant, excitotoxicneurotoxic versus neuroprotective. | A molecule that acts as neuroprotective at low concentrations may exhibit neurotoxic effects at elevated levels. | The compounds are under investigation for their possible functions as risk factors for the initiation of diseases, as biomarkers for early detection, or as targets for tentative interventions to slow down the progression . | Notwithstanding these initial findings, the exact biological importance of these compounds, particularly their involvement in metabolic pathways, remained unknown for a considerable period of time. | Further investigation in the mid-20th century revealed that Trp could be enzymatically degraded via the KYN pathway, producing several biologically significant compounds such as KYNA and QUIN (Figure 1). | Specifically, KYNA is thought to have antioxidant and neuroprotective properties, whereas 3-HK and QUIN act as pro-oxidants and neurotoxins . | Furthermore, this divergence has led to the concept of neuroprotective and neurotoxic sub-pathways within KYN metabolism . | Understanding this intricate balance may provide crucial insights into developing therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating KYN pathways for neuroprotection. | Trp is essential for protein synthesis and serves as a precursor to bioactive compounds such as serotonin, melatonin, and NAD, which are crucial for sustaining physiological functions . | These compounds are essential for maintaining physiological processes. | Their dual functionssome neuroprotective, some neurotoxicmake the KYN pathway an important area of research for understanding and potentially treating these diseases. | KYNA has been identified for its neuroprotective effects through antioxidant mechanisms, and historical research has gradually uncovered its contributions to protecting the brain from oxidative damage . | The broad recognition of KYNA as an antioxidant compound likely solidified in the scientific literature around 20052010 as more studies began to explore its multifaceted neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory roles . | However, the pathway also has neuroprotective functions, helping to regulate excitatory neurotransmission and prevent harmful cellular stress (Table 1). | These multiple roles in excitotoxicity, neuroprotection, and immune regulation make the KYN metabolism a critical focus for research into therapies for neurodegenerative and immune-related disorders, as its balance between toxicity and protection can significantly impact disease progression. | The KYN pathway, responsible for the metabolism of Trp into several neuroactive compounds, plays a dual role in neuroprotection and neurotoxicity, with KYNA contributing to the preservation of neuronal health (Table 1). | In research in the early 1990s, researchers further emphasized the neuroprotective effects of KYNA. | The development of the concept that the KYN pathway divides into neurotoxic and neuroprotective branches arose from early studies on the duality between KYN metabolites: KYNA as neuroprotective, and 3-HK and QUIN as neurotoxic . | This understanding of the pathways dual nature has since driven research aimed at developing therapeutic strategies to shift the balance toward neuroprotection by modulating KYNA and QUIN levels. | This complexity underscores the need to reconsider traditional views on how these compounds influence neuroprotection, excitotoxicity, and immune regulation. | This co-antioxidant activity highlighted the compounds nuanced role in modulating oxidative stress, depending on cellular conditions and its interactions with other antioxidant molecules. | This versatility positions 3-HAA as an important factor in physiological processes such as immune regulation and neuroprotection . | KYNA has been widely studied for its neuroprotective antioxidant properties, but recent research indicates it can also act as a pro-oxidant under certain conditions. | These interactions highlight KYNs role in balancing excitatory neurotransmission and immune responses, contributing to its involvement in both neuroprotective and neuroinflammatory processes. | Additionally, KYNA has inhibitory effects on metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), particularly the mGlu2 and mGlu3 subtypes, which are involved in regulating synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release . | Through these interactions, KYNA plays a neuroprotective role by limiting overactive excitatory signaling. | Activation of AhR by KYNA links it to anti-inflammatory processes, contributing to its broader neuroprotective properties . | Through these interactions, XA can regulate glutamate-related excitatory signaling and contribute to neuroprotective effects. | This interaction can modulate neurotransmission and has potential implications for neuroprotective strategies. | It was discovered that exercise-induced upregulation of enzymes in skeletal muscle, such as kynurenine aminotransferases (KATs), converts neurotoxic KYN into KYNA, a neuroprotective metabolite, thereby reducing stress-induced depression . | IAAld, while not a strong direct agonist, plays an important role in the metabolic pathways that lead to the formation of potent AhR activators , emphasizing the selective and context-dependent modulation of AhR by Trp metabolites (Table 2). | It has demonstrated neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects, preventing lipid peroxidation, reducing DNA damage, and inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine synthesis . | Physical activity has been shown to regulate the production and metabolism of KYN, altering the balance between neurotoxic and neuroprotective metabolites . | For example, KYN and its metabolites can act as inhibitors, modulating the activity of key enzymes involved in immune responses. | Pathway analysis allows researchers to map complex signaling networks, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or Janus kinasesignal transducers and activators of transcription (JAKSTAT) pathways, which often involve multiple orders of molecular interactions . | KYN metabolites exhibit dual behavior: some, like KYNA, are neuroprotective and act as antioxidants, while others, such as 3-HK and QUIN, promote oxidative stress and neurotoxicity . | This complexity in KYN metabolism challenges prior binary categorizations and highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of how these metabolites influence neuroprotection, immune regulation, and oxidative stress. | Furthermore, KYNAs neuroprotective and cytoprotective properties make it a promising nutraceutical that may promote cognitive health by scavenging neurotoxic metabolites . | Ultimately, this evolving perspective not only reshapes our understanding of neuroprotection and neurotoxicity but also sets the stage for novel clinical applications targeting metabolic imbalances. | IDO1 inhibitors such as epacadostat have been tested in advanced stages as standalone treatments or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, but some studies, including Phase III trials, have struggled to

Effect of SIRT1 Blockage on PF-Related Improvements of NF-κB, NLRP3 Inflammasome and Pyroptosis In order to further explore the role of SIRT1 signaling in PF-related antidepressants, EX-527, a SIRT1-specific inhibitor, was used in this study. | Then, we verified whether SIRT1 signaling also regulated the inhibitory effect of PF on the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. | Similarly, the immunofluorescence image of GSDMD-N showed that the inhibitory effect of PF on the expression of pyroptosis-related protein GSDMD-N in the CA3 area of mouse hippocampus induced by CUMS was obviously weakened by the treatment of EX-527 (Figure 7B,D). | These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of PF-related inactivation of NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis depended on SIRT1 signal transduction (Figure 7A,B). | In order to further explore the antidepressant mechanism of paeoniflorin, SIRT1 inhibitor EX-527 was used in animal experiment 2 and BV2 cells. | Here, we proved the inhibitory effect of PF on GSDMD-mediated microglia pyroptosis. | Moreover, SIRT1 inhibitor EX-527 hindered the protective effect of paeoniflorin in LPSATP-treated cells and CUMS-induced mice and promoted the expression of NF-κB, NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1, IL-1β and GSDMD-N. | In this study, we found that the activation of SIRT1NF-κB induced by PF significantly reduced the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome complex and its induced pyroptosis in CUMS mice and BV2 cells, while SIRT1 inhibitors blocked these effects. | 4.7.2.

Molecular Docking of Coumarin Derivatives with hMAOs Compounds 112, most of which are 5-hydroxycoumarin derivatives, were also investigated for their inhibitory effects on monoamine oxidase. | This study was conducted through the differential docking of the compounds into the structure of hMAO-A with the 7-methoxy-1-methyl-9H-β-carboline (harmine)-bound ligand (PDB code: 2Z5X) and hMAO-B in complex with 7-(3-chlorobenzyloxy)-4-(methylamino)methylcoumarin (PDB code: 2V61). | Based on the literature data, it was found that residues Tyr-326 (located in the side chain of MAO-B) and Ile-335 (located in the side chain of MAO-A), situated at the junction of the substrate and entrance cavity, play a crucial role in the substrateinhibitor selectivity of the two MAO isoforms. | Specifically, Tyr-326 prevents the binding of MAO-A selective inhibitors to the MAO-B active site, thus contributing to the selectivity toward either MAO-A or MAO-B . | Evaluation of the virtual ligandenzyme complexes of all coumarin derivatives within the catalytic site of MAO-A revealed that all tested compounds occupied the active site of MAO-A. | The best-ranked docking solutions of compounds 112 within the active site of MAO-A indicate that the coumarin moiety of all compounds binds in the polar region of the substrate cavity, near the FAD cofactor site. | The residues Tyr-69, Phe-352, Tyr-407, and Tyr-444 formed the bottom of the aromatic cage, which determined the binding orientation of the compounds and consequently influenced their activity, binding affinity, selectivity, and stability. | All compounds exhibited one or more hydrogen bonding interactions, except for compounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9. | Additionally, all the compounds demonstrated ππ interactions, except for the least active MAO-A inhibitors, i.e., compounds 2, 5, 6, and 9. | Therefore, it can be inferred that the reduced activity of these compounds against MAO-A may be attributed to the absence of hydrogen bonding interactions. | Furthermore, in the active compounds, namely, 11 and 12, hydrogen bonding and ππ interactions were observed to play a significant role in mediating MAO-A inhibition. | The best docking pose of compound 12 involved a hydrogen bond with Gly-110 and ππ interactions with Tyr-407, Ile-180, and Ile-335 of MAO-A. | This arrangement closely resembled the binding sites of the coumarin derivative 7-(3-chlorobenzyloxy)-4-(methylamino)methylcoumarin, which is a reference MAO-B inhibitor (Figure 4A). | Hydrogen-bonding interactions with Gln-206, Tyr-435, and Ile-198 were observed for compounds 5, 10, 11, and 12; interactions with Pro-104, Ile-198, and Leu-171 were observed for compound 3; interactions with Gly-58, Tyr-326, Pro-102, Arg-42, and Ile-199 were observed for compound 4; interactions with Gly-58, Cys-172, Lys-296, and Tyr-398 were observed for compound 7; interactions with Gly-434 and Gln-206 were observed for compound 2; interactions with Pro-104, Ile199, and Gln-206 were observed for compound 1; interactions with residue Ile-198 were observed for compounds 8 and 9; and interactions with residues Leu-171 and Gln-206 were observed for compound 6. | Additionally, all compounds showed ππ interactions, except compounds 8 and 12. | The ππ interactions were observed with Tyr-326 for compounds 1, 2, 3, and 9; interactions with Tyr-398 were observed for compounds 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11; interactions with Tyr-435 were observed for compounds 1, 2, 3, and 7; and interactions with Gly-57 were observed for compounds 4 and 10. | Additionally, πσ interactions have been observed with Ile-199 for compounds 2, 3, 5, and 11; interactions with Tyr-398 have been observed for compounds 3 and 4; and interactions with Gly-58 have been observed for compound 9. | 2.4. Biological Profile of Coumarin Derivatives as Potential Drugs for Treatment of AD 2.4.1. Evaluation of hAChE Inhibitory Activity As shown in Table 1, arylpiperazinyl derivatives of coumarin displayed varied hAChE inhibitory activity compared to the reference compound Ensaculin. | Compounds 19 did not show significant activity, with inhibition values ranging from 46 for compound 7 to 61 for compounds 1 and 2. | Only derivatives of 8-acetyl-7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin exhibited hAChE inhibitory activity. | For the 3-methoxyphenyl moiety, both compounds with a three-carbon and four-carbon linkers were active, with IC50 values of 2.80 μM for 8-acetyl-7-3-propoxy-4-methylchromen-2-one (11) and 4.95 μM for 8-acetyl-7-4-butoxy-4-methylchromen-2-one (12). | Additionally, compound 11, with a three-carbon linker, exhibited better hAChE inhibitory activity than compound 12, with a four-carbon linker. | 2.4.2. Evaluation of hMAOs Inhibitory Activity Compounds 11 and 12 showed a good inhibitor profile against hMAO-A, with IC50 values of 6.97 μM and 7.65 μM, respectively, compared to the reference compound, pargyline (IC50 10.9 μM). | This indicates that in terms of MAO-A inhibitory activity, only derivatives of 8-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin exhibited activity, while derivatives of 5-hydroxy and 6-acetyl-5-hydroxycoumarin had no effect. | Replacing (3-methoxyphenyl)piperazine with (2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine resulted in a drastic decrease in the activity of compounds. | In the case of inhibitory activity against MAO-B, the situation was completely different. | The highest activity was found for compounds 1, 3, 4, and 9 (Table 1), with the following values: 3 (IC50 1.88 μM) 1 (IC50 2.18 μM) 4 (IC50 3.18 μM) 9 (IC50 4.76 μM). | The derivatives of 4,7-dimethyl-5-hydroxycoumarin with the three-carbon linker (3 and 1) were the most active, with compound 3, containing a 3-methoxyphenyl moiety, performing the best. | The introduction of the 2-methoxyphenyl moiety only slightly affected the activity, changing from IC50 1.88 μM for compound 3 to IC50 2.18 μM for compound 1. | Similarly, extending the linker between the coumarin and piperazine moiety from three carbons to four carbons changed the activity from IC50 1.88 μM for compound 3 to IC50 3.18 μM for compound 4. | In the group of 8-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin derivatives, only 8-acetyl-7-3-propoxy-4-methylchromen-2-one (9) showed activity at the level of pargyline (IC50 4.76 μM for compound 9, compared to IC50 2.69 μM for pargyline). | 2.5. Molecular Dynamics Analysis of hAChE Inhibitors 2.5.1. Pose Analysis and Binding Mode of hAChE Inhibitors 1012 As indicated by the biological results, 7-O-arylpiperazinylcoumarins (10, 11, and 12) showed selective hAChE inhibitory activity. | Molecular dynamics were employed to gain insight into the binding modes of these compounds. | The binding free energy values for compounds 1012 that were calculated using the MM-GBSA method are presented in Table 1, together with the experimental values IC50 against hAChE. | Compound 10, which exhibited the lowest binding energy (77.24 kcalmol), emerged as the most potent hAChE inhibitor among the selected coumarin derivatives, which is consistent with the experimental study (IC50 1.52 μM). | Compounds 10 and 12, with a butylene linker, are predicted to be accommodated in the hAChE pocket in extended conformations, whereas compound 11, with a propylene linker, adopted a folded conformation. | Furthermore, it was observed that the coumarin moiety of compounds 10 and 12 is oriented toward the PAS of the enzyme, whereas in compound 11, the coumarin moiety is positioned in the CAS region. | The butoxy derivative 10 with the 2-methoxyphenyl substituent, which is one of the most potent hAChE inhibitors among the tested coumarin series, shows favorable interactions within the binding site. | Moreover, the coumarin moiety of compound 10 occupies the PAS of hAChE and engages in double ππ stacking interactions with the indole ring of Trp-286 (distances of 4.05 and 5.07 Å) and a π-alkyl interaction with Leu-289 (distance of 4.23 Å). | On the other hand, the 3-methoxyphenyl moiety of compound 12 binds to the CAS region, where it engages in a hydrophobic interaction with residues Trp-86 (5.02 Å) and Ile-451 (5.39 Å). | Another interesting case is represented by compound 11, with a propylene linker and a 3-methoxyphenyl substituent. | In this compound, there is an inversion of the binding mode compared to compounds 10 and 12. | In compound 11, the coumarin moiety is bound to the catalytic anionic site (CAS), exhibiting a hydrophobic interaction with the quaternary ammonium binding locus Trp-86 (lengths of 4.84 and 4.92 Å). | Taken together, all these results suggest that compounds 10, 11, and 12 could occupy the entire enzyme active sites, acting as dual-binding site inhibitors of hAChE. | The higher potency of the compounds with 7-O-arylpiperazinylcoumarin could be attributed to more favorable interactions with the target enzyme. | Therefore, to observe the motion of ligands in the enzymes active site, we performed MD simulations to explore different conformations and assess the stability of the inhibitorhAChE complexes. | From the twelve compounds evaluated, three C7-coumarin derivatives (10, 11, and 12) were selected for MD simulation analysis based on the agreement of experimental and computational evidence regarding their conformations with the hAChE enzyme. | It can be observed that the RMSD deviation amplitude for compounds 10 and 11 in the complex with hAChE is greater compared to the stability observed in the compound 12-hAChE complex. | However, after 20 ns, the complexes began to stabilize, indicating the compounds stable behavior through the strong inhibition of the target and explicit binding to the active site. | Afterward, we analyzed the RMSF to investigate the fluctuations of each residue in the enzyme complexed with three compounds, 10, 11, and 12, during the simulations. | The RMSF of the protein showed flexibility within a range of 0.097 to 0.115 nm for all three compounds (Figure 6BD). | The amino acid residues in the protein side chain for compound 10, specifically, Gly-120, Gly-256, Thr-262, and Gly-264 (Figure 6B); compound 11, specifically, Ser-30, Leu-138, Gly-230, Leu-281, Leu-398, and Lys-538 (Figure 6C); and compound 12, specifically, Ser-57, Thr-109, Ala-160, Gly-264, Leu-281, Glu-292, and Ala-542 (Figure 6D), showed fluctuations of more than 0.108 nm due to their positions on the proteins outer exposed surface. | 2.6. Molecular Dynamics Analysis of hMAOs Inhibitors 2.6.1. Pose Analysis and Binding Mode of hMAO-A Inhibitors 11 and 12 Biological results indicate that 7-O-arylpiperazinylcoumarins (compounds 11 and 12) exhibited selective inhibitory effects not only on hAChE but also on hMAO-A. | To gain further insight into their selective hMAO-A inhibitory activity, the binding modes of compounds 11 and 12 in hMAO-A were examined using molecular dynamics. | Compound 11, with the propylene linker and the 3-methoxyphenyl substituent, is a potent hMAO-A inhibitor, with an IC50 value of 6.67 0.76 μM. | It is approximately 1.2-fold more potent than compound 12 (8-acetyl-7-4-butoxy-4-methylchromen-2-one), which shows an IC50 of 7.65 0.32 μM. | The coumarin rings of both compounds were similarly located within the hydrophobic binding pocket of hMAO-A, interacting with the side chains of Ile-180, Ile-335, and Tyr-407. | Additionally, the acetyl group at the 8-position in compound 12 and the methyl group at the 4-position in compound 11 form πsigma interactions with Phe-352 (at distances of 3.94 Å and 3.90 Å, respectively). | The carbonyl group of the coumarin ring in compound 11 formed strong hydrogen bonds with Tyr-444 (2.39 Å) and Asn-181 (2.64 Å). | Compound 11 with a propylene linker is predicted to be accommodated in the MAO-A pocket in an extended conformation, as is compound 12 with a butylene linker. | The piperazine moiety of both compounds exhibited hydrogen-bonding interactions with the residues Ala-111 and Phe-208, with distances ranging from 2.41 to 3.00 Å. | Additional πalkyl interactions were observed between the piperazine moiety of compound 11 and Leu-97, Cys-323, Ala-111, and Val-210, with lengths of 4.51, 5.26, 4.40, and 3.94 Å, respectively. | Moreover, the phenyl substituent of both compounds forms ππ stacking and πalkyl interactions with residues Ala-111, Val-210, and Gly-110. | The methoxy group at the 3-position of the phenyl ring forms a stronger hydrogen bond with Ser-209 (2.09 Å) in compound 11 compared to compound 12, which interacts with residue Gly-110 (2.46 Å). | 2.6.2. Pose Analysis and Binding Mode of hMAO-B Inhibitor 1, 3 and 4 A series of 5-O-arylpiperazinylcoumarin and 7-O-arylpiperazinylcoumarin derivatives were evaluated as monoamine oxidase B inhibitors. | Among these, compounds 1 (IC50 2.18 μM), 3 (IC50 1.88 μM), and 4 (IC50 3.18 μM) exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity and the highest selectivity for MAO-B. | As noted in Table 1, among the studied proteinligand complexes, the C5-substituted coumarin derivatives, specifically compounds 1, 3, and 4, in complex with MAO-B exhibited the most negative binding free energy values, indicating stronger binding affinities, which correlates well with the experimental data. | Figure 8 illustrates the intermolecular interactions of compounds 1, 3, and 4 with the binding site residues of the MAO-B enzyme. | By analyzing the interactions of compounds 1, 3, and 4 with the MAO-B binding site, it can be observed that the coumarin moiety of compound 4, which has a butylene linker, unlike compounds 1 and 3 with propylene linkers, is located in the substrate cavity. | These interactions contribute to the stable binding of compound 4 within the MAO-B active site. | The 3-methoxyphenyl moiety of compound 4 occupied the entrance cavity of MAO-B and interacts with several residues through hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic interactions. | These interactions collectively contribute to the stabilization and binding of compound 4 within the MAO-B enzymes entrance cavity. | The binding mode of compounds 1 and 3 with a propylene linker positions the ligands within the central region of MAO-Bs active site, which is known for effective inhibitor binding. | Specifically, compound 3 with the 3-methoxyphenyl moiety shows a similar energetically favorable orientation as compound 1, which has a 2-methoxyphenyl moiety positioned in the binding pocket. | This orientation suggests that both compounds utilize the same binding interactions within the MAO-B active site, contributing to their inhibitory activity. | Meanwhile, the (2- or 3-methoxyphenyl)piperazine moiety of the compounds is positioned within the substrate pocket and the region between these two cavities. | This arrangement aligns well with the predictions from the docking calculations, highlighting how these compounds interact within the MAO-B binding site to exert their inhibitory effects. | The coumarin ring of both compounds forms πalkyl and πsigma interactions with residues Ile-199 and Ile-316 and hydrogen bonds with Pro-104 (in the range from 2.49 to 2.63 Å). | In compound 3, the arylpiperazinyl chain is further stabilized by hydrogen bonds with Ile-198 (2.56 Å), Leu-171 (2.67 and 2.76 Å), and Gln-206 (2.37 Å). | These interactions contribute to a higher affinity compared to compound 1, enhancing its binding to the MAO-B active site. | Moreover, the folded conformation of compound 3 allowed for favorable interactions of the 3-methoxyphenyl substituents with Tyr-398, Tyr-435, and Gly-434. | The binding modes of the compounds were analyzed in terms of the RMSD deviations of the ligands throughout the simulation time from the starting input structure. | These results suggest that the conformations of the tested compounds in complex with MAO-B varied at different stages of the MD simulation but ultimately stabilized. | To understand the mobility of the MAO-B enzyme in the presence of compounds 1, 3, and 4 within its binding site, RMSF analysis is crucial. | As shown in Figure 9BD, for the complexes of compounds 1, 3, and 4 with protein, fluctuations ranging from 0.12 to 0.14 nm were observed in the RMSF for each residue surrounding the ligand. | Apart from this, the RMSF values of catalytic residues such as Lys-296, orient keeper residues such as Tyr-326, Tyr-398, and Tyr-435, and gate residues such as Ile-199 were found to be very low, suggesting strong intermolecular interactions with the compounds 1, 3, and 4 in the ligandMAO-B complex. | 3.1.2. General Procedure for the Preparation of Compounds 112 The synthesis processes for new compounds 1 and 2 involved two steps. | In the first step, a mixture of 5-hydroxy-4,7-dimethylcoumarin (0.190 g, 1 mmol), 1,3-dibrompropane or 1,4-dibromobutane (0.34 cm3, 3 mmol of 1,3-dibrompropane for compound 1; 0.36 cm3, 3 mmol of 1,4-dibromobutane for compound 2), anhydrous K2CO3 (0.1 g), and a catalytic amount of KI was placed in a microwave flask. | For derivatives 3 and 4, the starting compound in the first step was 5-hydroxy-4,7-dimethylcoumarin (1 mmol) combined with 1,3-dibromopropane or 1,4-dibromobutane (3 mmol), respectively. | In the second step, 3-methoxyphenylpiperazine (2 mmol) was used for both compounds 3 and 4. | In the first step, 1,3-dibromopropane (3 mmol) was used for compounds 5 and 7, while 1,4-dibromobutane (3 mmol) was used for compounds 6 and 8. | To obtain derivatives 912, 8-acetyl-7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (1 mmol) was used as the starting compound in the first step, along with either 1,3-dibromopropane (3 mmol) for compounds 9 and 11 or 1,4-dibromobutane (3 mmol) for compounds 10 and 12. | 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra for compounds 312 are available in the ESI; spectra for compounds 34 and 78 are available in ; spectra for compounds 56 are available in ; spectra for compounds 910 are available in ; and spectra for compounds 1112 are available in . | Briefly, the enzyme was incubated at 25 C with an inhibitor (10 μM for single-point assay and 7 concentrations ranging from 30 to 0.01 μM for IC50 determinations) and chromophoric reagent 5,5-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in phosphate buffer with a pH of 8.0. After the addition of substrate acetylthiocholine, the increase in absorbance was read at 412 nm for 5 min and compared with a control sample devoid of inhibitor. | The structure of MAO-A with the highest resolution (PDB ID: 2Z5Y, resolution 2.1 Å), bound to the known inhibitor harmine was selected . | 3.3.2. Preparation of Ligands Twelve compounds were selected and studied (Figure 1): 4,7-dimethyl-5-coumarin) (1), 4,7-dimethyl-5-coumarin (2), 4,7-dimethyl-5-coumarin) (3), 4,7-dimethyl-5-coumarin (4), 6-acetyl-4,7-dimethyl-5-coumarin (5), 6-acetyl-4,7-dimethyl-5-coumarin (6), 6-acetyl-4,7-dimethyl-5-coumarin (7), 6-acetyl-4,7-dimethyl-5-coumarin (8), 8-acetyl-7-3-propoxy-4-methylchromen-2-one) (9), 8-acetyl-7-4-butoxy-4-methylchromen-2-one) (10), 8-acetyl-7-3-propoxy-4-methylchromen-2-one) (11), and 8-acetyl-7-4-butoxy-4-methylchromen-2-one) (12). | They belong to two groups of coumarin derivatives, which differ in the length of the linker between the coumarin and the piperidine rings: compounds 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 have propylene chains, and compounds 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 have butylene chains. | The geometries of all compounds were optimized using the density functional theory (DFT) with B3LYP6-311G hybrid functional, as implemented in Gaussian 16 . | Arylpiperazinyl derivatives of coumarin exhibited varied hAChE inhibitory activity compared to the reference compound, Ensaculin. | The results showed that most of these compounds exhibited high inhibitory activity and selectivity for hAChE and hMAO-B compared to hMAO-A. | The biological results showed that compound 8-acetyl-7-4-butoxy-4-methylchromen-2-one (10) (IC50 1.52 μM) was the most potent derivative for hAChE, while compounds 8-acetyl-7-3-propoxy-4-methylchromen-2-one (11) and 4,7-dimethyl-5-coumarin (3) exhibited the highest inhibitory activity against hMAOs (IC50 6.97 μM for hMAO-A11 and IC50 1.88 μM for hMAO-B3). | Our results confirmed the peculiar feature of coumarin substitution patterns, particularly that 8-substitution is detrimental to MAO-B activity while leading to selective MAO-A inhibitors . | Among these coumarin derivatives, compounds 11 and 12 exhibited potent and balanced inhibitory activity against both hAChE and hMAO-A. | Enzyme inhibition data and molecular modeling studies revealed that these compounds could bind simultaneously to the PAS and CAS of hAChE as well as occupy the substrate binding site in hMAO. | The simulation analyses of these inhibitors suggest specific prerequisites for the rational or intuitive design of inhibitors. | Based on in silico and in vitro studies, compounds 3 and 10 have been found to exhibit excellent pharmacokinetic properties and strong AChEMAO-B inhibitory activity, making them promising candidates for further investigation.","Alzheimers (MISC), AD (MISC), AD (MISC), AC (MISC), Alzheimer (MISC)"

11641501.xml,Marine Peptides: Potential Basic Structures for the Development of Hybrid Compounds as Multitarget Therapeutics for the Treatment of Multifactorial Diseases,"This diversity of propertiestogether with the peptides efficacy, which has been confirmed in several in vitro and in vivo studiesmake these compounds attractive as functional ingredients in pharmacy, especially in regard to multitarget drugs known as hybrids. | Given the possibilities offered by chimeric structures, it is expected that a hybridization strategy based on a marine-derived compound could result in a long-awaited success in the development of new effective compounds to combat a range of complex diseases. | However, despite the fact that the biological activity of such new hybrids may exceed that of their parent compounds, there is still an urgent need to carefully determine their potential off-targets and thus possible clinically important side effects. | Given the above, the aim of this paper is to provide information on compounds of marine origin with peptide structures and to verify the occurrence and usage of hybrid compounds built from these structures. | In many cases, it turns out that a single drug does not have the necessary effect to combat the cause of the disease, and the use of additional pharmacological substances leads to either inhibitory or reinforcing interactions. | Recently, the hybrid approach has been frequently applied to natural compounds, including endogenous bioactive compounds, such as neurotransmitters andor neuromodulators (e.g., endomorphins, substance P) , plant-derived compounds (e.g., terpenoids, β-triketone, phenols) or even molecules originating from animals (e.g., botulinum toxin, bleomycin, insulin) . | In this context, marine-derived compounds, in particular, have attracted much attention, as they are characterized by a wealth of beneficial effects, such as antimicrobial, cytotoxic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antiparasitic and multiple enzyme inhibitory activities . | Of course, it is extremely important here to distinguish between hybrid and multitarget compounds, whose numbers are constantly increasing in the market. | Structurally, multitarget compounds, except bivalent hybrid molecules, do not have specific building blocks that correspond to original drugs or other known ligands. | In contrast, hybrid compounds, as just mentioned, represent combinations of two or more bioactive structures from a different class or their pharmacophoric subunits in a single molecule, representing the desired properties of original drugs (Figure 1). | Although there are structural features that can distinguish the two types of molecules, the overall distinction is very fluid, as hybrid compounds are also multitargeted in terms of their ability to affect multiple biological targets and, thus, generate a broad spectrum of biological activities. | Regardless of the type of hybridization (i.e., fused, merged or linked), these novel compounds have been shown to offer certain advantages, especially compared to those combination therapy drugs. | Nevertheless, it should be considered that such a new compound is also a known molecule that has the potential to alter the pharmacological spectrum of the chimera (i.e., unexpected new functionalities might be seen) . | Marine PeptidesCharacteristics and Biological Activity of Selected Compounds Peptides are a class of compounds that, in addition to some advantages, have a number of serious limitations, such as conformational instability, a short half-life and inadequate penetration across the bloodbrain barrier (BBB) . | They usually consist of a great number of prolines responsible for the compounds stability . | These form a new subclass of peptide compounds consisting of amino acids with at least one ester bond replacing a peptide bond. | There are a large number of potent peptide compounds that occur naturally in marine organisms. | Of course, there are also reports on the isolation of other peptides from a variety of other marine-derived hydrolysates, such as peptides that inhibit HIV-1 protease and compounds with anti-anemic activity, etc. | Hence, protein hydrolysates should be thoroughly investigated as a new, additional source of potentially biologically active compounds. | 3.1. Fish Peptides Fish appear to be a readily accessible source of biologically active compounds among other marine organisms. | For example, tuna was the source of the first ever reported marine ACE-inhibitory peptide with the amino acid sequence Pro-Thr-His-Ile-Lys-Trp-Gly-Asp, showing efficacy at an IC50 of 2 μM . | Other tuna peptides, such as Leu-Pro-His-Val-Leu-Thr-Pro-Glu-Ala-Gly-Ala-Thr and Pro-Thr-Ala-Glu-Gly-Gly-Val-Tyr-Met-Val-Thr, have also been reported to have an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, with a corresponding IC50 values of 8.1 and 8.8 μM, respectively . | Some of the most potent compounds were isolated and identified by Lee and colleagues , as well as by Suo et al. | Significantly shorter compounds, such as Ile-Cys-Tyr and Leu-Ser-Phe-Arg, were also found to be active (Table 1). | Here, too, the molecular weight of the compound proved to be decisive for its activity. | Furthermore, as presented by the sequence, it was demonstrated that the type of amino acids, either N-terminal or C-terminal, could have an influence on the overall inhibitory activity against ACE. | Indeed, branched aliphatic amino acids at the N-terminus could improve the ACE-inhibitory effect of the peptides, while C-terminal amino acid residues containing a positive charge, such as Arg, could be conducive to elevated inhibition against ACE. | Also, both types of compounds exhibited a broad range of activities not only associated with antifungal, antiparasitic and antiviral properties but also closely related to the inhibition of cancer cells . | Tuna AEPAPAPAPAPEPAPAPA, GEPGPAG, LPGGGPVL, AAAPAPAPAPAPA, AGLYPGA antioxidative LPHVLTPEAGAT and PTAEGGVYMVT anticancer ICY, LSFR, IYSP antihypertensive (ACE-inhibitory) and antioxidative GILTLK antimicrobial WPEAAELMMEVDP antioxidative GDLGKTTTVSNWSPPKYKDTP antihypertensive Mackerel LDIQKEV, TAAIVNTA antioxidative Shark CF, EY, MF, FE antihypertensive (ACE-inhibitory) MLVGPIGAAKVVYEQ-XXXunknown amino acid residues not defined by the authors hepatoprotective, immunomodulatory, antidiabetic, antioxidative Sole GFFALIPKIISSPLFKTLLSAVGSALSSSGGQE (called pardaxin) antimicrobial, antitumor, increase in dopamine release MIFPGAGGPEL antihypertensive Hagfish GWFKKAWRKVKNAGRRVLKGVGIHYGVGLI antimicrobial (including antifungal activity) Cod TGGGNV, TCSP antioxidative, ACE-inhibitory Herring PPVEEP, GPAGDPA, GADPEDVIVS antidiabetic Salmon WA, WM, VW, MW, IW, LW, FL ACE-inhibitory GPAE antidiabetic Sardine LKVGGKGY, LY, YL, GRP, RFH, GWAP ACE-inhibitory 3.2.

Algae and Macroalgae Peptides Micro- and macroalgae peptides, also known as cryptides , are endogenous compounds that also offer health benefits. | This step led to several short peptides with ACE-inhibitory activity. | Another effect of pepsin, but also trypsin and chymotrypsin and that is used in enzymatic hydrolysis and carried out with the microalgae Isochrysis zhanjiangensis, yielded a compound with antioxidant activity in an in vitro alcohol-induced injury model . | revealed the compounds sequence as Asn-Asp-Ala-Glu-Tyr-Gly-Ile-Cys-Gly-Phe and found that this decapeptide acted through direct interaction with glutathione and superoxide dismutase, as the level of these enzymes turned out to be elevated. | The number of hybrid structures composed of marine-derived compounds is dramatically low, althoughas mentioned abovemarine-sourced molecules are recognized as an excellent basis for the discovery and development of new and highly bioactive compounds with a broad spectrum of activity. | Interestingly, such chimeric structures have been shown to be natural components in the secretions of marine organisms, which might explain their unique biological activities and mechanisms of action, which sometimes significantly differ from those of compounds identified in continental organisms. | Marine Peptide-Based Hybrids and Their Efficacy in Preclinical Studies One of the first hybrid compounds consisting of marine peptides was a SNX-202 chimera described by Ramachandran in 1994 . | Since the mechanism of action of conotoxins is mainly based on an interruption of activity of the three main ion channels (i.e., Na, Ca2 and K) involved in pain transmission, among others, the hybridization strategy applied to these snail peptides was shown to produce not only analgesic effects without motor deficits in animalsas demonstrated by original compounds but also to treat other pathological conditions, depending on the structure of the chimeras second pharmacophore. | Some marine organisms were found to have hybrid compounds per se. | , which showed that marine sponges from the family Thorectida, in particular Smenospongia aurea, are rich in chlorinated hybrid peptidepolyketide compounds called smenamides A and B (Figure 2). | Consequently, both compounds were characterized by their cytotoxic activity. | Okeania sp., a marine cyanobacterium, also has natural hybrid compounds. | This compound consists of three substructures: a polyketide unit, a peptide segment (Ala-D-MePhe-Sar-Ile-MeAla) and isoleucic acid . | However, this has also been shown for some of the macrocyclic odoamide analogs prepared by Kaneda and colleagues , such as the D-MeAla6 epimer (compound 1e;

Gly-Phe-Ala-Trp-Asn-Val-Cys-Val-Tyr-Arg-Asn-Gly-Val-Arg-Val-Cys-His-Arg-Arg-Ala-AsnminiPEG). | Remarkably, the compound also showed negligible hemolysis and improved proteolytic stability as compared to that of N6, as confirmed by an inhibition zone assay. | A hybridization strategy was also utilized not only to improve the properties and activity of the mature compound but also to identify its molecular target. | Kahalalide F, a potent anticancer molecule, was conjugated with a biotinylated linker to give compound kahalalide-biotin (Figure 2), for which human ribosomal protein S25 was found to be responsible for its potent anticancer properties in a dose-dependent manner . | Meanwhile, condensation of aplyronine A with a PEG-linked biotin hydrazide yielded compound 4 (Figure 2), a less potent derivative compared to that of aplyronine A (IC50 0.096 nM vs. | 0.010 nM, respectively, against the HeLa S3 cell line) and with similar depolymerizing activity to both fiver actin and the parent compound . | It is noteworthy that none of the presented compounds have been described in terms of their off-target side effects. | Furthermore, these molecules can serve as excellent building blocks for chimeric compounds proposed for the treatment of various complex diseases, especially when considering that current drug discovery strategies predominantly emphasize single molecule-based treatments. | Importantly, the sometimes high side effect profile reported for most marine compounds at therapeutic doses can be minimized by the chemical binding of the compound to another biologically active compound, as is the case in hybrids. | Hence, the toxicity of the parent compounds does not always translate into the toxicity of a hybrid composed of such compounds. | In addition, this review focuses on marine peptides, while many other different chemicals have been discovered, including phenolic compounds, fatty acids, polyethers, carbohydrates, etc. | Nevertheless, this review clearly shows that marine-derived compounds can serve as an excellent source of inspiration and as a starting point for drug development, and in this context, should attract much attention as potent, active pharmacophores for very complex molecules of a hybrid nature.",""

inflammatory processes, such as atherosclerosis, a common finding is the upregulation of plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAIs), which aggravate the development of inflammatory sludge. | An important caveat of modern pharmacology is the inadvertent application of MMP inhibitors to delay the spread of chronic inflammatory or metastatic processes. | This way, theoretically, even antihypertensive

kiss-1 overexpression was neuroprotective . | Finally, the QRFP-orexin heterodimer receptor has proven to have strong neuroprotective activity via the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 12 (ERK12) pathway . | The latter is a tyrosine kinase receptor, while the intracellular domain of the GH receptor binds Janus kinase (Jak) 2, which phosphorylates signal transducer and

. | Therefore, BChE hyperactivity can, at the same time, decrease the beneficial neuroprotective tone of ghrelin and block the essential cholinergic input to the hippocampus . | Then, the accumulation of DNA damage drives the upregulation of cell cycle checkpoint protein kinase 1 (CHK1) and of cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2 (CIP2A), leading to Aβ raft formation . | However, as mentioned above, the normal orexinergic tone is definitely neuroprotective and increases hippocampal memory formation confirmed by numerous experiments . | The neuroprotective activity may be exerted through RF-amide receptors, to which the orexins show the highest structural similarity. | The heterodimerization of the orexin and the pyroglutamylated RF-amide receptors (GPR103) apparently confer the highest neuroprotective activity , through the stimulation of ERKMAPK, NF-κB, PI3K-Akt, and Jak-STAT . | In general, apelin has proven to have strong neuroprotective activity . | Moreover, it stimulates the release of a well-known neurotrophic factor, BDNF . | Although very little data are available regarding the involvement of neuromedins in the development of Alzheimers disease, it is noteworthy that mild cognitive impairment can be associated with increased levels of neuromedin activity , despite the fact that neuromedins themselves appear to be intrinsically neuroprotective . | It appears that their effects can be attributed to non-specific neuroprotective or non-causal palliative memory-enhancing effects. | If one or more neuropeptides seem to play a disproportionately significant pathogenetic role in Alzheimers disease, they could be potential targets of pharmaceutical studies and could produce effective modulatory compounds. | It seems that in meno- and

Inhibition of Protein Aggregation A primary approach to neurodegenerative therapy involves small molecules designed to stop proteins from aggregating in the first place. | Researchers have developed small molecules that bind to Aβ monomers, preventing them from joining into toxic oligomers that interfere with synaptic function . | One such compound, tramiprosate, binds to Aβ and stabilizes it in a way that blocks its self-assembly, while EPPS (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid) has been shown to actually break down existing amyloid plaques in preclinical studies, suggesting potential to reduce Aβ burden in the brain . | Similarly, tau aggregation inhibitors focus on preventing tau from detaching from microtubules and forming neurofibrillary tangles. | This stabilization reduces cellular stress, making these inhibitors promising candidates for therapies targeting the root pathology of HD . | Proteasome activators, like 3,4-dimethoxychalcone, show promise in restoring UPS activity in AD models where they promote the degradation of tau and prevent its buildup within neurons. | By enhancing proteasome activity, these compounds can alleviate some of the toxic load within cells, reducing cellular stress and slowing disease progression. | Ambroxol, a compound that promotes lysosomal acidification, restores the activity of lysosomal enzymes like glucocerebrosidase, which is essential for breaking down alpha-synuclein fibrils . | In Parkinsons disease, small molecules like YM-1 help upregulate HSP70 and HSP27, which play key roles in stabilizing alpha-synuclein and preventing it from forming toxic oligomers. | Geldanamycin, an HSP90 inhibitor, promotes HSP70-mediated pathways that guide mutant huntingtin toward degradation. | In ALS, RAGE activation by AGEs and oxidative stress compounds motor neuron degeneration. | Experimental RAGE inhibitors are being studied for their potential to disrupt these harmful interactions and reduce inflammation, representing another promising direction for therapeutic intervention . | M2 microglia release cytokines such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), which help resolve inflammation and support neuroprotection . | PPAR-γ agonists and IL-10 enhancers are being explored to shift microglia toward an M2 phenotype, while agents targeting phagocytic pathways, such as TREM2 activators, aim to enhance the clearance of neurotoxic debris. | Similarly, STAT6 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 6) activation supports M2 differentiation, enhancing the expression of anti-inflammatory molecules like IL-10 . | Encouraging a shift from the pro-inflammatory M1 state to the neuroprotective M2 state is a promising strategy, with the potential to alleviate chronic inflammation and enhance neural repair. | It increases the permeability of the bloodbrain barrier (BBB), allowing peripheral immune cells to enter the brain, thereby compounding inflammation . | Two key anti-inflammatory cytokines with neuroprotective potential are IL-10 and TGF-β . | IL-10s neuroprotective role is evident in its ability to limit excessive immune responses, yet its levels are often insufficient to counteract sustained inflammation in neurodegenerative diseases . | Efforts to restore or enhance TGF-β signaling are underway, with the aim of reinforcing the brains natural anti-inflammatory mechanisms and providing support for neuronal survival . | Small molecule inhibitors targeting IκB kinase (IKK), an activator of NF-κB, aim to reduce cytokine release (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β) linked to neuronal damage in AD and PD . | These inhibitors selectively suppress NF-κB without broadly dampening immune response, showing potential in

help control inflammation and prevent neurodegeneration . | HDAC Inhibitors: HDAC inhibitors reduce inflammation by modulating gene expression. | By altering chromatin structure, these inhibitors selectively suppress pro-inflammatory genes while promoting protective responses. | In preclinical studies, HDAC inhibitors have improved mitochondrial function and enhanced neuronal resilience, positioning themselves as a promising approach to managing neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases . | For instance, gamma-secretase modulators and beta-secretase inhibitors target the enzymes

clearance of mHTT aggregates, alleviating some of the cellular stress induced by protein accumulation . | CRISPRa enhances the expression of neuroprotective genes, while CRISPRi selectively suppresses pathogenic genes . | In neurodegenerative diseases, synthetic mRNA can be used to produce neuroprotective factors like brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), supporting neuronal health and survival. | DNA methyltransferase inhibitors are being explored to reverse these harmful patterns, dynamically restoring gene activity associated with neuron protection . | HDAC inhibitors, which increase histone acetylation, are being developed to enhance the expression of genes vital for neuronal defense and repair. | In HD, HDAC inhibitors have shown potential in reactivating pathways for protein degradation, helping to clear toxic protein aggregates that are otherwise devastating to neurons . | By fine-tuning histone acetylation, DNA methylation, and non-coding RNA activity, these therapies provide a new way to enhance neuroprotection and resilience . | 4.4.1. HDAC Inhibitors: Unlocking Protective Genes One of the most compelling aspects of HDAC inhibitors is their ability to unlock protective genes by promoting histone acetylation, which makes DNA more accessible for gene expression. | DNMT inhibitors offer a way to reactivate these genes by removing methyl groups that silence them . | In diseases where aberrant methylation restricts essential cell functions, DNMT inhibitors could offer a controlled reset of gene expression, restoring pathways critical for neuronal health and repair . | To counteract this, scientists are exploring ways to enhance GPx production through gene editing and by introducing GPx-mimetic compounds that perform similar functions within neurons . | 5.3.2. Molecular Therapeutic Agents Alongside natural antioxidants, novel compounds are being developed to amplify or mimic their effects, offering neurons added protection against oxidative stress. | These compounds neutralize ROS directly at its source. | In addition to direct antioxidants, small molecules that mimic the action of key antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD, catalase, and GPx, offer an alternative therapeutic route. | Similarly, Ebselen, which mimics GPx function, neutralizes hydrogen peroxide and has demonstrated neuroprotective effects in preclinical studies of AD and ALS. | By boosting natural antioxidants, activating key protective pathways, and employing targeted synthetic compounds, these approaches aim to address oxidative stress at its roots . | Targeting these early post-translational modifications, such as through kinase inhibitors that block tau phosphorylation or enzymes that modulate SUMOylation, could help maintain synaptic architecture and function . | Current therapeutic developments are exploring small molecules like nicotinamide riboside and other mitochondrial enhancers that increase ATP production and improve calcium handling specifically within synapses, aiming to support the energy-intensive demands of neuronal communication . | Additionally, advanced acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are being designed to specifically enhance ACh signaling in the most affected brain areas, offering a more precise approach to preserving memory and cognitive function in AD . | For instance, small molecules that prevent alpha-synuclein from forming harmful aggregates could help protect dopamine production. | VMAT2 activators are also being explored to improve dopamine packaging within neurons, ensuring more dopamine is available for release . | Recent advancements in synaptic plasticity modulation, neurotrophic factor support, and direct synapse-targeted therapeutics are paving the way for innovative treatments . | 6.3.2. Neurotrophic Factors Advanced delivery methods for neurotrophic factors are improving synaptic resilience. | These implants bypass the bloodbrain barrier, ensuring targeted, continuous delivery to preserve neurons over time, offering a lasting neuroprotective effect . | By targeting receptor function, sustaining neurotrophic support, and directly bolstering synaptic structure, these approaches offer the potential for meaningful restoration of cognitive and motor function . | 7.1.2. Metabolomic Profiling Metabolomics analyzes small molecules within body fluids, uncovering metabolic disruptions that are distinctive to neurodegenerative diseases. | This approach helps identify high-risk individuals long before motor symptoms appear, supporting neuroprotective measures aimed at preserving brain health . | For example, patients with LRRK2 mutations may respond to LRRK2 kinase inhibitors, which directly address the cellular effects of this mutation. | This approach presents the potential to address not just cognitive symptoms but also mood-related symptoms, with microbiome adjustments providing a new avenue for neuroprotection . | In cases of gut dysbiosis where butyrate levels drop, BBB function can weaken, potentially letting harmful compounds into the brain. | Certain gut bacteria produce neuroactive compounds, including serotonin precursors, which activate the vagus nerve and influence brain regions involved in emotional regulation and stress. | In neurodegenerative conditions, promoting bacteria that produce serotonin and related compounds is being explored as a way to enhance mood and cognitive function through this gutbrain pathway . | Moreover, the vagus nerve plays a role in immune modulation, carrying signals from gut bacteria that produce anti-inflammatory compounds. | Clinical trials are currently evaluating whether prebiotic-rich diets can boost butyrate levels in the gut, potentially reinforcing BBB stability and providing neuroprotective benefits in conditions marked by neuroinflammation . | These treatments aim to reshape microbial populations in ways that bolster BBB function, reduce inflammation, and support neuroprotective signaling . | These systems use ligandssmall molecules designed to bind selectively to receptors found only on certain brain cellsensuring that treatments focus directly on affected areas, preserving healthy cells from exposure . | In ALS where motor neurons progressively deteriorate, researchers are developing targeted nanoparticles to deliver neuroprotective treatments right to these cells. | For instance, a single nanoparticle might be designed to carry both an anti-inflammatory agent and a neuroprotective compound, offering a dual approach for treating diseases like Alzheimers and Parkinsons where inflammation and neurodegeneration occur hand in hand . | For instance, patients with predominant amyloid pathology may benefit from anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies, whereas those with tau-related dysfunction might respond better to tau aggregation inhibitors or kinase inhibitors targeting tau hyperphosphorylation . | Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), for example, naturally secrete neurotrophic factors like BDNF and GDNF, which help neurons survive, form connections, and resist stress . | In Alzheimers, where neuronal support is critical, these neurotrophic factors could help protect brain cells from the effects of the disease . | Because exosomes can cross the bloodbrain barrier, they can deliver neuroprotective factors directly to the brain. | In Alzheimers disease, for example, specific CYP2D6 variants affect how patients metabolize cholinesterase inhibitors, a commonly prescribed class of drugs . | Studies on dual-inhibitor compoundsdesigned to disrupt tau or amyloid-beta accumulation while dampening neuroinflammationdemonstrate early promise in animal models. | These approaches reflect a novel shift toward multi-target treatments that consider the cascading effects of protein pathology on cellular inflammation, energy dysregulation, and neuronal survival, aiming for a broader therapeutic impact. | Beyond replacing lost neurons, stem cells are now engineered to release neurotrophic factors or anti-inflammatory molecules, creating a more supportive environment for remaining brain cells.","N (MISC), Alzheimers (MISC), Parkinsons (MISC), ALS (MISC), Huntingtons (MISC), CRISPR (MISC), N (MISC), N (MISC), Alzheimer (MISC), AD (MISC), Parkinson (MISC), PD (MISC), ALS (MISC), Huntington (MISC), HD (MISC), Alzheimer (MISC), Parkinson (MISC)"

11642200.xml,Variations in BDNF and Their Role in the Neurotrophic Antidepressant Mechanisms of Ketamine and Esketamine: A Review,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is critical for neuroplasticity, synaptic transmission, and neuronal survival. | BDNF plays a pivotal role in neuroplasticity and neurotrophic mechanisms that can be enhanced by traditional antidepressants, which have been shown to increase BDNF levels both peripherally and in targeted brain regions. | Ketamine and its S-enantiomer, esketamine, exert both rapid and sustained antidepressant effects through activation of glutamate-related pathways, with neurotrophic effects involving BDNF, as demonstrated in experimental studies. | Among these, the neurotrophic hypothesis has received considerable attention, focusing in particular on the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein essential for neuroplasticity, synaptic transmission, and neuronal survival . | The neurotrophic hypothesis proposes that downregulation of BDNF and subsequent impairment of neuroplasticity are central to the pathophysiology of MDD, linking the disorder to broader mechanisms of neuronal atrophy and synaptic loss . | Conventional antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have been shown to gradually increase BDNF levels with chronic treatment, which correlates with their delayed therapeutic onset . | Approximately 30 of patients fail to respond adequately to first-line therapies, including SSRIs or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). | BDNF: Functions, Distribution, and Implications BDNF is a critical neurotrophic factor that contributes significantly to the development, maintenance, and plasticity of neurons in the central nervous system . | BDNF is particularly known for its role in promoting neurogenesis, enhancing synaptic plasticity, and supporting neuronal survival . | This cleavage can occur intracellularly, within the trans-Golgi network by enzymes such as furin, or extracellularly, after the release of proBDNF into the synaptic cleft, by matrix metalloproteinases or the tissue plasminogen activatorplasmin system . | BDNF, Depression, and Antidepressants BDNF plays a critical role in synapse formation, plasticity, and neuronal survival, making it an important focus in studies of MDD. | This finding supports the neurotrophic hypothesis of depression, which suggests that reduced BDNF levels in individuals with MDD are associated with impaired neurogenesis, particularly in regions involved in emotion and memory . | Antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), have been shown to increase BDNF levels both in peripheral blood and in specific brain regions such as the hippocampus, which is critical for mood regulation and neurogenesis . | The rapid onset of these effects, often evident within hours, and their persistence for weeks after a single dose suggest that ketamines action involves more complex processes than simple NMDA receptor blockade, particularly those related to synaptic plasticity and neurotrophic signaling, including BDNF pathways . | The importance of BDNF and its interaction with TrkB in ketamines mechanism of action is highlighted by studies showing that ketamines antidepressant effects are blocked by the infusion of an anti-BDNF neutralizing antibody into the mPFC , by BDNF or TrkB knockout models, and by the systemic administration of a selective TrkB inhibitor (Figure 2). | Studies using pharmacological inhibitors or genetic ablation models of microglia have demonstrated that the absence or inhibition of these cells completely abolishes the antidepressant effects of ketamine, emphasizing their essential role in the drugs mechanism of action . | The importance of BDNF and its interaction with TrkB in ketamines mechanism of action is highlighted by studies showing that ketamines antidepressant effects are blocked by the infusion of an anti-BDNF neutralizing antibody into the mPFC , by BDNF or TrkB knockout models, and by the systemic administration of a selective TrkB inhibitor (Figure 2). | This is supported by clinical findings indicating that rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, does not reduce the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine and may actually enhance them . | The neurotrophic potential of ketamine has even led to studies exploring its application in patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers . | In fact, recent clinical findings suggest that ketamine may provide neuroprotection and alleviate neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with Alzheimers disease, due to its ability to act as an NMDA receptor antagonist and modulate brain inflammation and glutamate-related neurotoxicity . | BDNF is critical for synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, and neuronal survival, and its altered expression has been implicated in the development of depressive symptom . | The neurotrophic hypothesis of depression suggests that reduced BDNF levels in key brain regions, such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, contribute to the neuronal atrophy and synaptic dysfunction observed in MDD, which in turn leads to the manifestation of depressive symptoms . | In addition, it is important to note that the central neurotrophic mechanisms involving BDNF are studied experimentally with ketamine, whereas human studies typically focus on plasma BDNF levels.","##D (MISC), ##D

Differential Effects of DMF, MMF, and CBD on the Activation of Nrf2 in Neurons and Microglia Activation of the Nrf2 transcription factor has been proposed as one of the main mechanisms of action of DMF, with this pathway being of special relevance in neuroprotection as it promotes the upregulation of antioxidant target genes, conferring cells with resistance to oxidative damage . | Finally, we aimed to directly study the neuroprotective effects of DMF, MMF, and CBD by comparing the ability of the three drugs to protect neurons from apoptosis. | All of these results confirm that our murine microglia cell line responds to LPS treatment and is a suitable model to study neuroprotection by DMF, MMF, and CBD. | In order to examine the neuroprotective effect of the drugs, we checked the expression of general inflammatory genes. | Discussion In this study, we examined the potential use of DMF as a neuroprotective agent by analyzing its ability to activate the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway and protect neurons against apoptosis. | Furthermore, we compared the effects of DMF with its bioactive metabolite, MMF, and the potential use of CBD as an adjuvant therapy in neuroprotection. | However, the control of neurodegeneration is still an unmet need in MS, highlighting the necessity of developing drugs with demonstrated neuroprotective properties. | In this respect, DMF could be relevant beyond its immunomodulatory effects on the peripheral immune system due to its ability to cross the BBB and because it has demonstrated neuroprotective properties in vitro . | Nevertheless, several studies have suggested that DMF and MMF exert differential effects in vitro in neurons and glial cells, highlighting the necessity of comparing both compounds to evaluate their potential as neuroprotective therapies . | Nevertheless, activation of the transcription factor Nrf2 could still be relevant for neuroprotection, as the beneficial effects achieved by DMF related to neurodegeneration and oxidative stress in preclinical models appear to be mediated by this pathway . | Our results confirm, at the protein and transcriptomic level, that DMF is able to activate the Nrf2 pathway in neurons, in line with the published literature, demonstrating the neuroprotective potential of DMF due to the antioxidant properties conferred by this pathway that could protect neurons against the oxidative stress that is produced in inflammatory conditions . | However, we also found that the biologically active compound MMF did not produce the activation of Nrf2 at the protein level and only produced a slight upregulation of the expression of two Nrf2-related genes at the transcription level, suggesting that, although DMF and MMF are structurally related compounds, they present different abilities to modulate the Nrf2 pathway. | In addition, we observed that CBD also produced the activation of the Nrf2 pathway in neurons and to a higher magnitude than DMF, highlighting its potential as an adjuvant therapy for the achievement of antioxidant properties and neuroprotection. | In this regard, it has been shown that in keratinocytes, CBD can activate the Nrf2 pathway by both increasing the level of activators such as p21 and p62 and by reducing level inhibitors such as Keap1 and Bach1 . | In addition to the antioxidant effects attributed to DMF in neurons, it has been suggested that DMF could exert indirect neuroprotective properties through the immunomodulation of microglia and astrocytes . | NF-kB p65 negatively regulates the transcriptional activity of Nrf2 by competing with the transcriptional co-activator CREB binding protein, resulting in Nrf2 inactivation . | The inhibition of the NF-kB pathway by DMF and CBD was supported by the inhibition of NO production, which is produced by microglia in proinflammatory states, as its production was reduced by both compounds. | The three compounds showed the protection of neurons against apoptosis, confirming the potential of DMF as a neuroprotective agent; MMF also presented neuroprotective potential despite presenting differential molecular effects with DMF; and CBD also presented potential as an adjuvant neuroprotective drug in MS. | In these experiments, as neurons and microglia were both drug-treated, we could not discern whether the neuroprotection was achieved due to the antioxidant effects in neurons, the immunomodulation of microglia, or both. | Although both DMF and CBD activated Nrf2 at the protein level in neurons, the transcriptomic results suggest that DMF activates the Nrf2 pathway more extensively, modulating a higher number of genes compared to CBD, thus highlighting the potential of DMF in neuroprotection through the activation of antioxidant responses. | Although MMF could be responsible for the immunomodulatory effects observed in MS patients, our results suggest that DMF could be more relevant than MMF for the achievement of neuroprotection. | This could be translated into the improvement of clinical benefits, approaching, on the one hand, the immunomodulation of the peripheral immune system, and on the other hand, neuroprotection in the CNS. | In addition, our results highlight that CBD has the potential for use as a neuroprotective therapy in MS due to the observed antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects in neurons together with the immunomodulatory benefits in microglia. | The combination of CBD with other approved MS therapies such as DMF, with which it shares signaling pathways including Nrf2 and NF-kB, could be a relevant strategy to achieve neuroprotection in MS patients. | CBD also engages the Nrf2 pathway, with evidence showing that its activation surpasses DMF in magnitude in neuronal cells, further supporting the antioxidant and neuroprotective effects. | MMF, while less active on the Nrf2 and NF-kB pathways compared to DMF and CBD, contributes to anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects through distinct mechanisms, which remain to be elucidated. | The shared and complementary actions of these compounds (DMFs strong Nrf2 activation and NF-kB inhibition, MMFs distinct anti-inflammatory pathways, and CBDs potent antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties) create a theoretical framework for their synergistic potential in reducing neurodegeneration and inflammation while promoting neuronal survival. | While the present study provides significant insights into the individual therapeutic effects of DMF, MMF, and CBD, a limitation lies in the lack of in vitro experiments testing the combination of these compounds. | Although the mechanisms of action we describe in this manuscript for DMFMMF and CBD suggest potential synergistic interactions, direct experimental validation of this synergy should focus on systematically evaluating the combination of the three compounds to better understand their potential interactions. | In vitro experiments examining the combined effects of these compounds on pathways such as Nrf2 activation, NF-kB inhibition, and neuronal apoptosis will be crucial. | Such studies would provide critical insights into whether their interactions enhance neuroprotection and anti-inflammatory effects, supporting the hypothesis of synergy in vivo. | All of the compounds were titrated in their respective vehicle and diluted into the culture media for cell treatments. | Conclusions Our study highlights that DMF and MMF present different molecular mechanisms of action, suggesting a higher potential of DMF in neuroprotection due to its ability to activate the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway and inhibit the inflammatory NF-kB pathway. | DMF and CBD share common mechanisms of action, with similar antioxidant properties in neurons and anti-inflammatory effects in microglia, highlighting the potential of exploiting CBD as an additional therapy in neuroprotection.","Di (MISC), D (MISC), MS (MISC), D (MISC), D (MISC), Nr (MISC), D (MISC), LPS (MISC), Nr (MISC), D (MISC), MS (MISC), D (MISC), Fu (MISC), Germany (LOC), Cambridge (LOC), USA (LOC), Europe (LOC), Cambridge (LOC), USA (LOC)"

Natural Compounds Many natural compounds have anti-inflammatory properties and are able to influence the aberrant inflammation due to their ability to interfere with several steps leading to inflammasomes activation, assembly, and the resulting signaling pathways (Table 2). | Formononetin and Genistein are two isoflavone compounds that have protective effects on DSS-induced acute colitis, attenuating colon epithelial damage and reducing protein levels of the NLRP3 pathway by inhibiting NF-κB . | These natural compounds improved inflammatory conditions and colon tissue damage in a DSS-induced colitis mouse model by regulating the NF-κB signal and NLRP3 inflammasome, as well as the damage to the colon epithelial barrier, restoring the tight junction (TJ) architecture. | The Nrf2-activating compounds, Cardamonin, Dimethyl fumarate (DMF), and Coptisine, are able to inhibit inflammasome activation. | Andrographolide (Andro) is a natural diterpenoid with antibacterial, anti-asthmatic, antiviral, and neuroprotective activities that attenuates the progression of colitis and tumor burden. | VI-16, a synthetic flavonoid compound, shows powerful anti-inflammatory effects, demonstrating its potential use for the treatment of IBD. | To date, several pharmacological drugs, as well as natural compound inhibitors, have been documented. | However, inflammasome inhibitors are not yet applicable in clinical practice. | There is a need for highly selective and potent inhibitors that target specific inflammasome components.","##D (MISC), NL (MISC), Irritable Bowel Syndrome (MISC), IBS (MISC), Inflammatory Bowel Disease (MISC), IBD (MISC), c (MISC), ##ac (MISC), Colorectal Cancer (MISC), CRC (MISC)"

11642712.xml,Retinal Ganglion Cell Replacement in Glaucoma Therapy: A Narrative Review,"The successful treatment in glaucoma patients is a direct neuroprotection by decreasing the intraocular pressure, which enables RGC protection but does not revive the lost ones. | It is believed that at this stage of glaucoma, possible neuroprotective strategies may concentrate on restoring the normal homeostasis between injured RGCs and their environment. | At this early stage, possible neuroprotective therapies are thought to repair the damage, which probably remains still reversible at the cellular and molecular level and aim to decrease the level of inflammation to prevent additional damage. | In some cases, neuroprotective treatment may protect RGCs before the occurrence of apoptosis. | The strategy of having a neuroprotective potential has been broadly proven in a plethora of multicenter studies focused on decreasing the IOP. | However, RGC regenerative or enhancing strategies with IOP decline or the possible application of direct neurotrophic factors cannot be a viable solution for many patients with advanced glaucoma. | However, every part of this strategy meets obstacles when preservingrestoring RGCs and regenerating their axons are considered using the following approaches: (1) increase the RGC survival or supplement the retina with new RGCs, (2) overcome the inhibitory potential of the optic nerve environment for neurogenesis, (3) enhancecreate RGC axon growth, and (4) create the right RGC connections with their typical targets in the brain . | The latest research showed that astrocytes straightaway take action to deliver neuroprotection during stress by using alternative metabolic resources . | On the other hand, neuroprotective strategies with the application of transplanted cells which defend the endogenous neural tissue have demonstrated encouraging outcomes in animal models of some retinal disorders (reviewed in ). | The possible neuroprotective pathway of action may involve the secretion of trophic factors andor the modulation of inflammatory processes. | Moreover, cell transplantation may improve the endogenous repair mechanisms via the enhancement of inhibitory signals to encourage axonal regeneration and neuritic growth . | Unfortunately, nowadays, there are neither neuroprotective nor axogenic therapies capable of restoring lost visual pathway connectivity in degenerative retinal disease nor translatable techniques to replace the lost RGCs and photoreceptors . | Moreover, NPCECs secretome may induce RGC differentiation in vitro, and TGF-beta 1 is one of the neurotrophic factors pivotal in this process . | Additionally, the studies identified various neurotrophic pathways and the differentiation of stem cells into RGCs consisting of fibroblast growth factor, insulin-like growth factor , bone morphogenetic protein, nodal, and Wnt signaling pathways . | Other studies showed that the addition of small molecules, such as valproic acid, butyrate, AZA5-aza-cytidine, vitamin C, MEK inhibitor, transforming growth factor-β receptor inhibitor, ROCK inhibitor, and GSK3β inhibitor could increase the reprogramming efficacy and finally replace the application of certain transcription factors in the methods of obtaining iPSCs . | Unfortunately, the studies regarding subretinal application described both cellular factors and ECM molecules as inhibitory to graft migration. | They also change the immune response and the inflammatory process, and the major hypothesis explaining the neuroprotective effects of hMSC focuses on their involvement in the modulation of neuroinflammation, a key process initializing RGC regeneration . | The intravitreal application of MSCs in mice models of different ocular disorders, e.g., retinal degeneration, retinal ischemia, retinitis pigmentosa, and also glaucoma, show that the agents produced by the MSCs have beneficial neuroprotective effects. | Bone MSCs constitute an optimal source of cells for the therapy of retinal degenerative disorders and can be obtained in response to tissue injury and repair to strive for paracrine neurotrophic influence . | The other paracrine factor with a suggested neurotrophic and neuroprotective role is VEGF. | Additionally, Müller glia have been reported to produce different trophic agents with the capacity to influence the various stages of the formation of retinal neuronal connection during the differentiation, synaptogenesis, and neuroprotection of photoreceptors and RGCs in the retina . | Finally, donor RGCs may be genetically modified to produce neuroprotective factors and change the recipient microenvironment to improve the endogenous cell vitality and decrease ongoing functional and structural injury. | Unfortunately, the delivery of NTF has no proven efficacy in enhancing the long-term neuroprotection, which is probably caused by the need for regular administration, and additionally, it applies in combination which may cause the receptor down-regulation after therapy. | On the contrary, the resolution of this down-regulation problem may be achieved via the application of a virus to enhance the expression of BDNF and its receptor TrkB in RGCs which have been proved to have a neuroprotective action in the case of laser-induced glaucoma . | The capacity of miRNA to decrease the level and action of a plethora of mRNA makes them a probable candidate for RGC neuroprotective therapy, especially in that they can be easily applied to the vitreous cavity to achieve a rapid and focused influence on RGCs .","R (MISC), R (MISC), R (MISC), R (MISC), R (MISC), R (MISC), G (MISC)"

significantly higher twitch and tetanus forces in response to electrical field stimulation after one and two weeks of differentiation compared to non-innervated muscle bundles cultured with or without neurotrophic factors. | Non-innervated muscle bundles also experienced a decline in rise and fall times as the culture progressed, whereas innervated muscle bundles and non-innervated muscle bundles with neurotrophic factors maintained more consistent rise and fall times. | Interestingly, neurotrophic factors alone, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), have also been shown to rescue denervation-induced muscle atrophy8, 9, demonstrating the functional importance of neuron-associated paracrine signaling on muscle growth. | To determine any impacts of neurotrophic factors on muscle differentiation, we also cultured non-innervated muscle bundles with or without neurotrophic factors. | Then, a small molecule cocktail that included CHIR99021, DMH1, and SB431542 was incorporated into the differentiation media formulation described in the previous section without ACA to generate OLIG2-positive

1.5 mgmL ACA and 10 ngmL of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and glial cell derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) were added to submerge bundles. | Media was exchanged after 2 days, and after 4 days in growth media with ACA and neurotrophic factors, media was switched to differentiation medium with ACA and neurotrophic factors and cultured on a rocker, as described above. | Media was then exchanged every other day, with neurotrophic factors removed after one week of differentiation. | Select muscle bundles without motor neurons were also cultured in

variability in the primary harvest of chick myoblasts. | The presence of neurotrophic factors had no impact on the normalized magnitude of contraction force (Figure 4B, C). | Innervation and neurotrophic factors also impacted the dynamics of twitch contractions. | In non-innervated muscle bundles without neurotrophic factors, the rise time (Figure 4E) and fall time (Figure 4F) decreased close to significantly and significantly, respectively, from one to two weeks of differentiation, which is consistent with a loss of slow fibers andor gain of fast fibers. | In contrast, bundles cultured with neurotrophic factors, with or without motor neurons, maintained more consistent rise and fall times from one to two weeks of differentiation (Figure 4 E,F), possibly indicating less remodeling towards a fast, glycolytic phenotype. | At the one-week timepoint, non-innervated muscle bundles without neurotrophic factors expressed higher levels of the fast twitch gene myosin heavy chain (MYH1A) compared to muscle bundles with neurotrophic factors and motor neurons (Figure 5A). | Slow myosin light chain 3 (MYL3) was also downregulated in non-innervated bundles with neurotrophic

similarly increased stepwise from non-innervated bundles, to non-innervated bundles with neurotrophic factors, to innervated bundles (Figure 5B). | A-FTM, encoding alpha-tropomyosin, a gene associated with fast twitch fibers32, was also downregulated in non-innervated bundles cultured with neurotrophic factors compared to the other two conditions (Figure 5B). | Neurotrophic factors alone also

experienced a significant decline in rise and fall time from one to two weeks, consistent with a transition from slow to fast fibers. | By contrast, innervated muscle bundles and muscle bundles with neurotrophic factors maintained a more constant rise and fall time, suggesting that more slow fibers were maintained. | Paracrine crosstalk between motor neurons and skeletal muscle involves a complex

11642846.xml,Expanding GABAergic Neuronal Diversity in iPSC-Derived Disease Models,"Conventional methods for neuronal differentiation sought to mimic embryonic developmental cues, employing small molecule-based patterning strategies to neuralize PSCs before steering their differentiation toward specific neuronal cell types.5 Despite their utility, these approaches face several limitations, including partial induction of neural identities, protracted timelines required to generate mature neuronal cultures and variability in differentiation efficacies across different PSC lines. | These GABAergic induced neurons (iNs) exhibit high efficiency in adopting GABAergic neurotransmitter phenotypes and express various subtype-specific markers, indicating the generation of potentially diverse sub-populations through this protocol.7 Despite this cellular heterogeneity, we and others have shown that GABAergic iNs are valuable for investigating inhibitory synapse-specific phenotypes linked to human neurological disorders.7,13,14 However, the characterization of GABAergic iNs has predominantly relied on functional assays such as electrophysiology, limited analysis of a small panel of GABAergic markers by immunofluorescence, and bulk transcriptomic profiling. | Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we comprehensively characterized GABAergic iNs generated from small molecule-patterned PSCs (patterned-iNs) and compared them with PSC-derived ASCL1DLX2-iNs (PSC-iNs), revealing that each method produces a variety of GABAergic neuronal subtypes with a composite of brain regional identities. | These observations prompted us to investigate whether extrinsic small molecules could synergize with ASCL1 and DLX2 to rapidly generate diverse inhibitory neurons associated with specific brain regions. | We first induced central nervous system neuroectoderm from human PSCs by inhibiting TGF-β and BMP signaling using SB431542 and LDN193189 and blocking WNT signaling with the tankyrase inhibitor XAV939.20 After this patterning phase, DOX was applied to induce ASCL1 and DLX2 expression in these neural progenitor cells, alongside DAPT, a γ-secretase inhibitor, to eliminate dividing progenitors and synchronize maturation.21 The cells were then dissociated and co-cultured with mouse astrocytes to promote neuronal maturation and synapse formation. | Consistent with our findings from immunofluorescent staining7, these clusters exhibited variable enrichment for inhibitory neuron subtype markers, such as SST, CALB1, CALB2, VIP, and NPY (Figures 1C and S3A). | The gene expression signature of 7D-patterned-iGABAs (cluster 2) reflected spatial origins and subtypes associated with the caudal and lateral ganglionic eminences (GE), marked by NR2F2 (COUP-TFII), PAX6, and ISL1.22,23 ISL1 was also strongly expressed in cluster 0, which consisted of PSC-iGABAs, whereas PSC-iGABAs in cluster 1 robustly expressed FOXA2 and NKX22, markers typically associated with inhibitory neurons in the hypothalamus.24,25 In addition to TFs, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to ion channel proteins, neurotransmitter receptors, and calcium-binding proteins across the molecularly distinct clusters, further underscoring the molecular diversity of GABAergic neurons generated by different methods (Figure 1C and Table S2). | Interestingly, the expression levels of NMDAR subunits GRIN2A and GRIN2B were notably higher in neurons produced with the small molecules (Figure S3B). | In contrast, neurons generated in the absence of small molecule patterning factors (PSC-iGABAs) aligned more with the hypothalamic and thalamic regions. | Notably, NR2F1, NR2F2, and PAX6 are expressed in GE and play pivotal roles in the development of cortical interneurons and inhibitory neurons in the ventromedial forebrain. | This method, akin to the direct conversion of PSCs to GABAergic neurons driven by ASCL1 and DLX2, results in a homogeneous population of cells with an inhibitory identity. | SMAD and WNT inhibitors can induce forebrain lineages from human PSCs, including excitatory and inhibitory neurons15,18. | When ASCL1 and DLX2 were induced in hPSCs exposed to SMAD and WNT inhibitors, homogenous GABAergic neurons could be derived without the need for SHH or its agonist. | This difference highlights the distinct developmental trajectories and functional specializations of the two types of iNs. Notably, recent work utilizing barcoding tools for lineage tracing suggested that individual human cortical progenitors can produce both excitatory and inhibitory neurons.61 Cortically-derived inhibitory neurons share transcriptional similarities with CGE-derived interneurons but lack definitive marker genes. | Given the expression of SP8 and NR2F2 in the patterned iNs, it is possible that some of these neurons represent cortically-derived inhibitory neurons. | It interacts with several proteins, including the chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 4 (CHD4), a key component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex.62,63 Together with CHD4 and HP1γ, ADNP forms the ChAHP complex, which inhibits gene transcription.62 In Adnp knockout embryonic stem (ES) cells and mouse embryos, defects in neuronal fate specification have been observed.62 Additionally, impaired excitatory and inhibitory synapses have been reported in juvenile Adnp haploinsufficient mice.60 Consistent with these findings, our data suggest that the p.Tyr719 variant not only alters the specification of neuronal subtypes within the GABAergic lineage but may also disrupt synaptic transmission in differentiated cells. | Small molecule-mediated GABAergic neuron generation Human PSCs were differentiated into cortical inhibitory neurons using an established protocol based on dual SMAD inhibition, WNT inhibition, and SHH activation,18,19 with the following modifications. | Prepare the Inhibitor Stock Solution (0.46 D() Glucose and 25 mM NaHCO3 in1 EBSS), Low Ovo (10X) solution (3 g BSA (Sigma A8806), and 3 g Trypsin inhibitor (Worthington LS003086) in 200 mL D-PBS, adjusting the pH to 7.4) and High Ovo (5X) solution (6 g BSA and 6 g Trypsin inhibitor in 200 mL D-PBS, pH 7.4). | The single-cell suspension was washed four times, alternating between low Ovo solution (9 mL inhibitor stock solution and 1 mL Low Ovo (10X)) and high Ovo solution (4 mL inhibitor stock solution and 1 mL High Ovo (5X)). | To assess the similarity of PSC-derived GABAergic neurons to inhibitory neurons from the developing fetal brain, we utilized previously published scRNA-seq data from Bhaduri et al.23 encompassing weeks 18, 19, 20, and 25 of gestation across various brain regions (neocortex, striatum, thalamus, hypothalamus, ganglionic eminence, midbrain, and cerebellum). | The combined dataset was first refined to focus on neurons expressing the inhibitory neuron makers GAD12 (log norm counts 0).","GA (MISC), ASCL (ORG), DL (ORG), GA (MISC), GA (MISC), ##C (MISC), GA (MISC), ##C (MISC), AD (MISC), Ty (MISC), GA (MISC), GABA (MISC), GA (MISC), ##C (MISC)"

Citrus Extracts Display Vasorelaxant Activity A preliminary series of experiments was performed to assess whether the citrus extracts, namely, the ethanolic extract and the subsequent n-hexane and dichloromethane phases, contained compounds capable of inducing in vitro vasorelaxation. | In rings stimulated by 60 mM KCl, which causes membrane depolarization and CaV1.2 channel opening, all the compounds assessed caused concentration-dependent relaxation with pIC50 values (estimated for tangeretin and sinensetin) of 4.91 0.35 (scutellarein TME, n 5), 4.40 0.28 (tangeretin, n 5), 4.39 0.11 (nobiletin, n 5), and 4.23 0.26 (sinensetin, n 5) (Figure 5). | All the compounds assessed in endothelium-denuded preparations caused concentration-dependent relaxation of the α1 adrenergic receptor agonist phenylephrine-induced contraction. | None of the pure compounds assessed affected the τ of activation. | As shown in Figure 7, the representative docking poses for the most active compounds, i.e., scutellarein TME and tangeretin, selected based on the most favorable docking score values, were very similar: in both cases, the p-methoxy-phenyl ring was sandwiched between Trp1447 and Tyr1489 and engaged a π-π stacking with the latter. | This difference could explain the lower activity of these compounds compared with their monomethylated counterparts. | To get an insight into the binding modes of the compounds investigated, a docking study was carried out using a homology model of the rat CaV1.2 channel. | In fact, the same arrangement was precluded for the less active dimethoxylate compounds sinensetin and nobiletin due to steric hindrance. | The chemicals used in the biological assays included collagenase (type XI), trypsin inhibitor, bovine serum albumin, TEA chloride, phenylephrine, acetylcholine, nifedipine (Sigma Chimica, Milan, Italy), tangeretin and scutellarein TME (Extrasynthese; Genay Cedex, France), nobiletin and sinensetin (DBA, Segrate, Milan, Italy), and sodium nitroprusside (Riedel-De Haen AG, Seelze Hannover, Germany). | Nifedipine, directly dissolved in ethanol, and the analyzed compounds, directly dissolved in DMSO, were diluted at least 1000 times before use. | Extracts and pure compounds were assessed on rings pre-contracted by either 25 mM or 60 mM KCl and by 0.30.6 µM phenylephrine, respectively. | 4.3.3. Cell Isolation Procedure for Patch-Clamp Experiments Smooth muscle cells were freshly isolated from the tail main artery, at 37 C, using collagenase (type XI, 1.2 mgmL) treatment in the presence of bovine serum albumin (1 mgmL) and trypsin inhibitor (1 mgmL) in 2 mL of 0.1 mM Ca2 external solution containing 20 mM taurine. | 4.6. Multivariate Curve Resolution (MCR) To identify the compounds in the extraction procedure, the raw 1H-NMR spectra of the four standard compounds and fraction M3 (all samples in triplicate) were exported and converted into human-readable files (.csv), ready for direct import into MATLAB R2023a (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). | Molecular modeling studies provided a structural basis to rationalize the in vitro inhibitory effect of the four isolated Citrus peel PMFs on IBa1.2. The resultant SAR will undoubtedly inspire the development of novel CaV1.2 channel blockers based on the flavone backbone.","C (MISC), NMR (MISC), UPLC (MISC), N (MISC)"

cantleyoside, laciniatosides, sylvestrosides, GI-3, GI-5, oleonuezhenide, (Z)-aldosecologanin and centauroside. | Sylvestroside I was the compound with the highest number of biological tests, whereas cantleyoside was the compound with the highest number of specific biological tests. | Actually, these sub-units may be extremely different, and the bond may occur in different positions of both the sub-units, including the glucose moiety but also after conjugation with other classes of natural compounds like phenolics and terpenes to act as a bridge between them . | The literature search was conducted on renowned scientific databases such as PubMed, PubChem, Google Scholar and Reaxys using keywords like bis-iridoid, bis-iridoids, occurrence, biological activities alone or together and specific names of compounds or plant species, as recovered from previous papers. | Indeed, all the papers not concerning plant species, concerning a mixture of plants where the identification of this type of compounds has not been clearly attributed, deriving from cell cultures or from sure enhancement of their production in a botanical or biotechnological manner, were neglected. | The first one regards the real existence of compounds having methyl, ethyl and dimethyl acetal groups, like in abelioside A methyl acetal, abeliforoside C, abeliforoside E, cantleyoside dimethyl acetal, cocculoside, dipsanoside J, saugmaygasoside D, sylvestroside III dimethyl acetal, sylvestroside IV dimethyl acetal, triplostoside A and tripterospermumcin B methyl acetal or having methyl ester, ethyl and butyl groups, like in aldosecolohanin B, atropurpurins AB, pterocesides AC, cornuside K, hookerinoid A, hookerinoid B, pterhookeroside and tricoloroside methyl ester. | Given the methodologies adopted for their extraction and isolation, these compounds are likely to be artifacts , even if they are often found, thus evidencing their extreme ease of formation. | It is not very simple to establish which is correct, but this whole situation can be easily solved by a simple analytical procedure constituted of steps of maceration, separation and identification using non-corresponding solvents, meaning not methanol for methyl acetal, dimethyl acetal and methyl ester compounds and not ethanol and butanol for ethylated and butylated compounds. | The presence of these functional groups in the same compounds obtained following this way will be clear evidence of the fact they are not artifacts. | Indeed, they are often considered as different compounds, but they present the same structure, and thus, they are the same compound. | Another issue is surely the need for major harmonization on the names of these compounds. | This has been widely shown for the compounds named GI-3 and GI-5 in this paper. | One single name for each compound is compulsory in order to avoid confusion and possible identification mistakes. | The choice of giving trivial names to new compounds is always up to the authors, but this should always be encouraged, since it can really diminish the possibility of giving different names to the same structure, considering them to be new when they are not. | The most fitting example of this is the compound named in this review as iridoid glycoside dimer I. | The most present compound in plants is cantleyoside, which has been reported in twenty-one different species belonging to ten different genera and four different families. | Conversely, several compounds have been found in single species. | The presence of specific compounds in different species of the same genus, in different genera of the same family and in different families of the same order is extremely important, since it allows the individuation of chemophenetic markers at these levels. | On the contrary, the presence of specific compounds in single species has no chemophenetic relevance due to their extremely limited distribution. | The compound with the highest number of reports in the same species is centauroside in Lonicera japonica with twenty-three citations. | Centauroside is also the compound with the highest number of studies for different populations of the same species (Lonicera japonica) collected in different countries. | The multiple presence of the same compound at every classification level confirms that this compound is usually biosynthesized here, which is extremely important under the chemophenetic standpoint, potentially considering it as a chemophenetic marker. | For what concerns the other compounds, some have been reported in single species, while others in too many. | The highest number of biological studies has been observed for sylvestroside I, whereas cantleyoside is the compound presenting the highest number of biological studies for the same type. | However, bis-iridoids have mostly shown anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral and enzymatic inhibitory effects, which are in perfect agreement with those reported for simple iridoids . | At the moment, the comparison of the effectiveness values between bis-iridoids and simple iridoids cannot be performed as well, for the same previous reasons but also because some bis-iridoids are unconventionally structured (there is no base structure to compare to), almost all bis-iridoids are constituted by different sub-units (it is impossible to establish the starting compound) and the bond between the sub-units of bis-iridoids transforms the base structure and modifies its geometry (the comparison may not be reliable due to possible different mechanisms of action). | The bis-iridoids reported so far in the literature are mainly characterized by the link between two seco-iridoids sub-units under the structural profile and mostly exert anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral and enzymatic inhibitory activities, both with good and low effectiveness values.",""

11643077.xml,Synthesis of 1,2,4-Oxadiazin-5(6H)-One Derivatives and Their Biological Investigation as Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors,"Monoamine oxidase (MAO) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of central nervous system disorders, and MAO inhibitors have been used in the treatment of depression and Parkinsons disease. | In the search for new classes of MAO inhibitors, the present study investigated a series of 1,2,4-oxadiazin-5(6H)-one derivatives. | The results of the in vitro MAO inhibition studies showed that the 1,2,4-oxadiazin-5(6H)-ones were indeed inhibitors of human MAO with the most potent inhibition observed for 5f (IC50 0.900 µM) and 7c (IC50 0.371 µM). | It was concluded that, with appropriate substitution, 1,2,4-oxadiazin-5(6H)-one derivatives would act as good potency MAO-B inhibitors and lead compounds for the development of antiparkinsonian drugs. | In Parkinsons disease, MAO-B inhibitors enhance central dopamine levels and reduce MAO-mediated production of hydrogen peroxide and resultant oxidative injury. | MAO is expressed in the brain as well as peripheral tissues where it has a key function in the metabolism of neurotransmitter amines while also acting as a metabolic barrier to bioactive amine compounds that are derived from the diet . | Although the MAO isoforms share approximately 70 amino acid sequence identity and have similar three-dimensional structures and active sites, these isoforms display different substrate and inhibitor specificities . | MAO-A specifically metabolizes serotonin, while the arylalkylamine compounds, benzylamine and phenylethylamine, are specific substrates for MAO-B. | Dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, and tyramine are examples of compounds that are metabolized by both isoforms . | Based on the role of MAO-A as a source of oxidative stress in the heart, MAO-A inhibitors may represent a future strategy for the treatment of heart disease. | Based on their physiological roles in the metabolism of neurotransmitters, the MAOs are validated drug targets and inhibitors of these enzymes have been used to treat disorders such as Parkinsons disease and depression . | Besides a potential neuroprotective role in Parkinsons disease, MAO-B inhibitors also reduce central dopamine metabolism and depletion and thereby provide a symptomatic benefit, particularly as an adjuvant to levodopa therapy . | Although both MAO isoforms metabolize dopamine, MAO-B inhibitors are used in Parkinsons disease due to safety concerns over early irreversible MAO-A inhibitors, while with aging, the MAO-B isoform increases in the brain, suggesting a more dominant role in dopamine metabolism for MAO-B versus MAO-A. | In depression, MAO-A inhibitors reduce the central metabolism of serotonin and noradrenaline, while enhanced MAO-A density in several brain regions has been implicated in the depletion of monoamine levels in major depression . | Among the classical neurotransmitters that are metabolized by the MAOs, serotonin and the deficiency thereof has been most closely linked to depression, which underscores a role of MAO-A inhibitors in the treatment of this illness. | MAO inhibitor drugs that have been approved for clinical use include irreversible (e.g., tranylcypromine, phenelzine, rasagiline, selegiline) and reversible (e.g., moclobemide, safinamide) inhibitors . | Numerous heterocyclic compounds have been reported as possessing MAO inhibition activities. | Examples are the nonspecific inhibitor, isatin, and the MAO-A-specific inhibitor, harmine (Figure 1) . | In general, both MAO isoforms have nonpolar active sites; however, regions where polar interactions are possible exist in proximity to the FAD, which is where the heterocyclic moieties of many MAO inhibitors bind . | In the search for new classes of heterocyclic compounds that inhibit the MAO isoform, the present study investigates a series of 1,2,4-oxadiazin-5(6H)-ones as potential MAO inhibitors. | Isomeric 1,3,4-oxadiazin-5(6H)-one derivatives (e.g., compound A) have been reported to inhibit MAO . | These compounds have the potential to form hydrogen bonds, while cyclic amidine structures have been shown to possess a diversity of biological activities . | Several studies to date have investigated synthetic approaches and biological activities of this class of compounds . | Thus, this study had two goals: first, to optimize the conditions of the reaction between 2-halocarboxylates and amidoximes, and second, to evaluate all 1,2,4-oxadiazin-5(6H)-ones (new as well as previously obtained) as MAO inhibitors. | Carbonyl compounds 2, bases, reagent amounts, solvents, and time were varied; in all cases, the reactions were carried out at room temperature. | Surprisingly, changing the carbonyl compound to methyl 2-chloroacetate led to improved yields (Table 1, entries 714). | Thus, entry 9 represents the most optimal conditions (e.g., base, reagent amounts, solvent, and time) when using carbonyl compound 2b as a substrate, producing the target 1,2,4-oxadiazin-5(6H)-one (3a) with a satisfactory yield of 50. | Using the optimized conditions, we applied the reactions of amidoximes 1ai and carbonyl compounds 2bd to synthesize the corresponding 1,2,4-oxadiazin-5(6H)-ones 35 (Scheme 1). | The structures of two compounds (3a and 5b) were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (Scheme 1). | To more systematically evaluate 1,2,4-oxadiazin-5(6H)-one derivatives as potential MAO inhibitors, a series of 15 of our previously synthesized compounds , containing a methoxycarbonyl function (6af), an oxadiazole ring (7ad), and a carboxyl group (8ae) at position 6 (Scheme 2), were included in this study. | 2.2. Biological Studies The 1,2,4-oxadiazin-5(6H)-one derivatives (38, 37 compounds) were investigated as potential inhibitors of MAO by employing the recombinant human MAO-A and MAO-B enzymes and kynuramine as a substrate . | The reference inhibitors, isatin, harmine and safinamide, were selected for this study since they are, similar to the study compounds, reversible MAO inhibitors. | Isatin is a nonspecific inhibitor, while harmine and safinamide represent potent and specific inhibitors of MAO-A and MAO-B, respectively. | While clear structureactivity relationships were not apparent, it was noticeable that five of the most potent MAO-B inhibitors (5a, 5b, 5d, 5e and 5f) were substituted with an ethyl on the C6 position of the 1,2,4-oxadiazin-5(6H)-one ring. | These compounds were more potent inhibitors than the unsubstituted (3) and methyl (4) substituted homologues, which indicated that an ethyl in this position was more advantageous for MAO-B inhibition. | However, not all derivatives with C6 ethyl substituents were potent MAO-B inhibitors (e.g., 5c, 5g, 5h, 5i). | Two other compounds were also found to be good potency MAO-B inhibitors: 3f and 7c. | The good potency of this compound may have been dependent on an ability to better fill the MAO-B active site. | Indeed, many good potency MAO-B inhibitors such as safinamide have larger extended structures. | Although it was not possible to highlight a specific C3 substituent as most optimal for MAO inhibition, among the seven most potent MAO-B inhibitors, two compounds were substituted with the 4-(methoxyphenoxy)phenyl on C3 (3f and 5f). | Compound 5f was the second most potent MAO-B inhibitor of the study, which indicated that this group should be considered in further structure optimization studies. | The large structural diversity of these compounds precluded the possibility to derive meaningful structureactivity relationships. | To investigate the mode of MAO inhibition, LineweaverBurk plots were constructed for the two inhibitors of the respective MAO isoforms, 3f and 5f. | For each inhibitor, six plots were constructed using a range of eight substrate concentrations (15250 µM) for each plot. | The inhibitor concentrations were selected to bracket the IC50 values. | For the inhibition of MAO-A by 3f, the inhibitor concentrations ranged from 1 to 5 µM, while for the inhibition of MAO-B by 5f, the inhibitor concentrations ranged from 0.25 to 1.25 µM. | For each isoform, a plot was also constructed in the absence of the inhibitor. | The LineweaverBurk plots are presented in Figure 3 and are indicative of competitive inhibition since the lines intersect close to the y-axis, while the slopes increase with increasing inhibitor concentration. | From replots of the slopes versus inhibitor concentration, Ki values of 1.3 and 0.35 µM were estimated for the inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B by 3f and 5f, respectively. | For (R)-5f, hydrogen bonding was observed between the carbonyl of the inhibitor and the phenol group of Tyr188, while for (S)-5f, hydrogen bonding was observed between the oxadiazinone NH and the side chain carbonyl of Gln206. | The placement of the ethyl side chain in this space seems to be beneficial for inhibitor stabilization when considering that the unsubstituted compound 3f is a weaker MAO-B inhibitor than 5f. | The preparation and characteriation of compounds 6af, 7ad, 8ae were described previously . | Stock solutions of all compounds were prepared in DMSO and added to the enzyme reactions to yield a final concentration of 4 DMSO. | Visual inspection of the enzyme reactions found no indication that the inhibitors precipitated from the aqueous reaction buffer at higher concentrations (e.g., 100 µM). | Using this approach, the rates of kynuramine oxidation by MAO were measured in the presence of different concentrations of the test inhibitors (0.003100 µM) as well as in the absence of inhibitor. | These data were used to construct sigmoidal curves of the rate versus the logarithm of inhibitor concentration (log), which were subsequently fitted to the one-site competition model of the Prism 5 software package (GraphPad). | A set of six plots were constructed for each test inhibitor using five inhibitor concentrations that bracketed the IC50 value as well as one plot in the absence of inhibitor. | Subsequently, the slopes of the LineweaverBurk plots were plotted versus inhibitor concentration, and the Ki values were estimated from the x-intercept (Ki x-intercept). | The most potent MAO-A inhibitor was 3f with an IC50 value of 3.75 µM. | Two compounds were found to inhibit MAO-B with submicromolar potencies, 5f and 7c, with IC50 values of 0.900 and 0.371 µM, respectively. | An analysis of the structureactivity relationships suggested that ethyl substitution on C6 was in general more optimal for MAO-B inhibition than the corresponding methyl substituted and unsubstituted compounds. | In this regard, five of the most potent MAO-B inhibitors (5a, 5b, 5d, 5e and 5f) were substituted with an ethyl group on C6. | For the C3 position, the 4-(methoxyphenoxy)phenyl substituent was highlighted as being present in two good potency MAO-B inhibitors (3f and 5f) and one good potency MAO-A inhibitor (3f).","Mon (MISC), MA (MISC), MA (MISC), Parkinsons (MISC), MA (MISC), MA (MISC), B

11643108.xml,E-box independent chromatin recruitment turns MYOD into a transcriptional repressor,"MYOD is an E-box sequence-specific basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) transcriptional activator that, when expressed in non-muscle cells, induces nuclear reprogramming toward skeletal myogenesis by promoting chromatin accessibility at previously silent loci. | These results extend MYOD biological properties beyond the current dogma that restricts MYOD function to a monotone transcriptional activator and reveal a previously unrecognized functional versatility arising from an alternative chromatin recruitment through E-box or non-E-box sequences. | Introduction MYOD has a unique property to activate skeletal myogenesis upon ectopic expression in non-muscle cells also known as MYOD-mediated trans-differentiation or myogenic conversion of somatic cells1,2 which reflects its function as endogenous activator of skeletal myogenesis in muscle stem cells (MuSCs) during skeletal muscle regeneration3,4. | Previous studies have identified specific domains that confer on MYOD the property as a DNA sequence-specific transcriptional activator21. | Discussion The results shown here reveal a novel property of MYOD as transcriptional repressor from non-E-box sequences, thereby challenging the existing dogma that has historically restricted MYOD biological property to that of a sequence-specific transcriptional activator from myogenic E-box sequences. | As such, this finding extends, in principle, our knowledge on MYOD from a monotone activator of gene expression to versatile regulator of gene expression. | We show that MYOD exerts its function as a dual activator and repressor of gene expression during the process of cellular trans-differentiation into skeletal muscle, by coordinating two key events within the nuclear reprogramming toward the myogenic lineage - activation of the genes that establish the new cell identity (i.e., skeletal muscle lineage), and erasure of the cell-of-origin lineage genes. | Of note, we identified specific molecular modules used by MYOD to repress gene expression from promoters or enhancers of target genes with dedicated domains, whereby repression of mitogen- and growth factor-responsive genes from promoters requires a highly conserved domain within the first helix, while repression of cell-of-origin and alternative lineage genes from SE requires the AD and CRDs. Our results reveal an interplay between genetic, epigenetic, and molecular determinants that confers on MYOD a dual function of transcriptional activator or repressor. | Specific domains confer on MYOD the property as an E-box-specific transcriptional activator namely, the basic domain that restricts its DNA binding affinity to specific E-box motifs, the HLH domain that promotes interactions with E1247an acidic activation domain (ActDom) at the N-terminus, and two chromatin remodeling domains located at the CH-rich domain and C-terminus21. | Likewise, binding to nucleosomes promotes the chromatin remodeling activity of bHLH TFs and activates the enzymatic activity of transcriptional co-activators, such as acetyltransferases63,64. | In sum, our data extend the biological properties of MYOD beyond our current knowledge, by revealing its dual function as activator and repressor of gene expression, through a multifaceted mechanism. | Nuclei were then extracted in hypotonic buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl, 0.05 NP-40, 1 mM PMSF and 1x protease inhibitor) and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5 SDS, 0.5 NP-40, 1 mM PMSF and 1x protease inhibitor). | 15μg of sonicated chromatin were diluted in 500μl RIPA Dilution Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1 Sodium Deoxycholate, 0.7 NP-40, 1 mM PMSF and 1x protease inhibitor), and precleared for 3 hours at 4C with Protein AG dinabeads.","MY (ORG), E (MISC), He (MISC), Loop (MISC), He (MISC), MY (ORG), E (MISC), M (MISC), M (MISC), CTCF (MISC), M (MISC), MY (ORG), M (ORG), E (MISC), E (MISC)"

Aegypti mosquitoes (23). | Here, we describe the use of an in vitro model to screen for trehalase inhibitors in Ae. aegypti and determine the impact of trehalose metabolism on a mosquito-borne virus. | ValA and novel trehalase inhibitors (5-ThioTre, 6-TreNH2) prevented conversion of cell culture media trehalose to glucose. | Differences in the activity of trehalose analogues seen in vitro and in vivo suggest that there are opportunities to optimize trehalase inhibitors for target species (23). | Previous research suggests that the relationship between autophagy and DENV infection in Aag2 cells is complicated and that conventional autophagy inhibitors may not work as expected in these cells (44). | This manuscript describes an in vitro model that can be used to rapidly screen novel trehalase inhibitors and probes and underscores the importance of trehalose metabolism in Ae. aegypti physiology and the transmission of a mosquito-borne virus.","Aede (MISC), A (MISC), A (MISC), A (MISC), A (MISC), A (MISC), ##ede (ORG), DEN (ORG), Zika (MISC), Z (MISC), ##I (ORG), ##K (MISC), chikungunya (MISC), CHIK (MISC), Americas (LOC), Africa (LOC), Asia (LOC)"

Tannins Tannins are structurally complex polyphenolic compounds found in plants, categorized based on their structure into hydrolyzable tannins, condensed tannins, and complex tannins, with molecular weights typically exceeding 500 Da . | A total of 60 such compounds have so far been reported in CF. | The tannin compounds in CF are predominantly hydrolyzable tannins, which can be divided into three main types based on structural characteristics: gallotannins, ellagitannins, and chebulic ellagitannins. | Gallotannins are formed through ester links between gallic acid (68) and glucose or polyols, including compounds such as 1-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose (1), 6-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose (2), 3,6-di-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose (3), and several dimethyl ester derivatives. | Ellagitannins are produced by esterification involving hexahydroxydiphenic acid (HHDP) or ellagic acid (76) with glucose or rhamnose, for instance, compounds such as eschweilenol C (19), 4-O-(4-O-galloyl-α-L-rhamnosyl) ellagic acid (20), and various dimethyl ester derivatives like gemin D (24) and tellimagrandin I (31) and II (34). | isolated nine hydrolyzable tannins from CF, comprising three previously unidentified and six artifact compounds, along with thirty-nine known ones. | The newly identified compounds were characterized by spectroscopic analysis as 1,2,3-tri-O-galloyl-6-O-cinnamoyl-β-D-glucose (17), 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-galloyl-4-O-cinnamoyl-β-D-glucose (18), and 4-O-(2,4-di-O-galloyl-α-L-rhamnosyl) ellagic acid (26). | Additionally, the following artifact compounds were identified: 1-O-methyl neochebulanin (49), methyl chebulagate (52), 6-O-methyl neochebulagate (56), dimethyl neochebulagate (58), dimethyl 4-epi-neochebulagate (59), and dimethyl neochebulinate (60) . | To date, 28 compounds have been reported in CF. | Hydroxybenzoic acids, derivatives of benzoic acid, feature a seven-carbon atom framework conforming to a C6-C1 structure, exemplified by compounds such as protocatechuic acid (63) and gallic acid (68). | The study meticulously adjusted variables such as solvent concentration, temperature, and extraction time to maximize the yield of these specific phenolic compounds . | To date, 15 such compounds have so far been reported in CF. | 3.4. Triterpenoids The triterpenoid compounds in CF primarily consist of pentacyclic triterpenes and their glycosides. | Triterpenoids are a class of terpenoid compounds fundamentally comprising a carbon skeleton of 30 carbon atoms, existing in plants either in free form or conjugated with sugars as glycosides or esters. | These compounds exhibit a wide range of biological activities. | To date, 20 triterpene compounds have been reported in CF. | 3.5. Flavonoids Flavonoid compounds are widely distributed in nature, with the majority being hydroxy-substituted flavonoid derivatives. | To date, 6 such compounds have been reported in CF. | 3.6. Volatiles Volatiles are a class of small, volatile compounds that act as secondary metabolites. | It also features carboxylic acid compounds like shikimic acid (144) and methyl shikimate (145). | molecules-29-05547-t001_Table 1Table 1Information regarding compounds from Chebulae Fructus.NO.ClassificationCompoundMolecular FormulaRef. | Pharmacological Properties Many modern pharmacological studies have proven antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, anticancer, antibacterial, hepatoprotective, nephroprotective, neuroprotective, anti-diabetic, and other activities of CF (Figure 9 and Table 2). | The antioxidant activity of a compound can typically be attributed to its electron-donating nature, as seen in functional groups like OH and COOH. | Therefore, the high content of phenolics in the CF extract suggests that a significant number of OH groups in the phenolic compounds from CF may be responsible for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities . | The findings further indicate a correlation between the concentration of polyphenolic compounds and the enhancement of antioxidant activity . | These compounds are highly effective in preventing oxidative stress and inhibiting oxygen- or peroxide-induced reactions . | Chebulagic acid (50) and chebulinic acid (51), two of the effective compounds identified in CF, are widely recognized for their substantial antioxidant capabilities. | To sum up, the extracts and compounds of CF showed excellent potential with respect to antioxidant effects and had broad application prospects. | CF and its chemical compounds exhibit anti-inflammatory properties. | These compounds mediate their effects by disrupting arachidonic acid metabolism, suppressing nitric oxide (NO) release, and modulating various signaling pathways. | Moreover, CF aqueous extract and its compounds actively inhibit these mediators by dampening the STAT13 and NF-κB signaling pathways . | In addition, CF and its chemical compounds manifest anti-inflammatory properties by modulating pertinent signaling pathways. | Specifically, compounds such as corilagin (22), chebulanin (44), chebulagic acid (50), and chebulinic acid (51) are cited for their efficacious impact in mitigating arthritis symptoms . | Furthermore, the compound effectively downregulated the phosphorylation of NF-κB and IκBα. | 4.3. Antiviral Activity Numerous studies have reported the inhibitory effects of CF on viral infections caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), influenza A virus (IAV), herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). | One study observed inhibitory effects of two broad-spectrum antiviral natural products, chebulagic acid (50) and punicalagin (38), on the replication of SARS-CoV-2. | These compounds appear to function as allosteric regulators, targeting the enzymatic activity of the viral 3CLpro . | The inhibitory activities of 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose (14) against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro demonstrate its potential for impeding viral protease activity, thereby underscoring its therapeutic potential for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections . | However, the efficacy of nucleoside analog inhibitors against RdRp is frequently undermined by the proofreading capabilities inherent to coronaviruses. | Recent studies have identified corilagin, a non-nucleoside inhibitor, as an effective agent targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Corilagin (22) binds directly to RdRp, robustly inhibiting its polymerase activity, as evidenced by both cell-free and cell-based assays . | The compounds containing CF exhibit potential as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and RdRp, thereby impeding viral replication. | This interaction underscores the therapeutic potential of these compounds in managing H1N1 infections . | Recent research has highlighted chebulagic acid (50) and chebulinic acid (51) as novel inhibitors capable of thwarting IAV replication. | These compounds emerge as promising NA inhibitors, with potential for development into effective antiviral agents targeting IAV . | Previous studies have reported that CF extract or its active compounds had a good inhibitory effect on viruses such as HSV-1, HSV-2, and HIV-1. | These compounds effectively inhibit the entry of HSV-1 into A549 cells by targeting and neutralizing key viral components. | These compounds effectively inhibit the attachment and penetration of the virus into host cells, surpassing the efficacy of acyclovir, the conventional drug used for managing HSV infections . | The study reported that CF contains four inhibitors of HIV-1 integrase, specifically gallic acid (68) and three derivatives of galloyl glucose. | This significant inhibition suggests the extracts potential as a source for novel anticancer compounds. | Furthermore, this compound effectively downregulated the PI3KAkt signaling pathway and reduced the nuclear localization of β-catenin, both of which were upregulated in the MCF7-6.412w cells. | In an analysis of ellagic acids (76) therapeutic potential, it has been observed that this compound effectively diminishes the colonization of cancer cells and promotes apoptosis. | This investigation underscored ellagic acids capability as a significant inhibitor of CDK6, warranting further exploration within the realm of CDK6-targeted anticancer strategies. | The research findings indicate that ethyl acetate, methanol, and aqueous extracts from CF all possess inhibitory effects on Porphyromonas gingivalis. | Additional research is needed to identify the specific compounds responsible for its antibacterial activity . | The half-maximal inhibitory concentrations for the extract and corilagin (22) were found to be 0.13 µgmL and 3.18 µgmL, respectively. | 4.8. Neuroprotective Activity Extract from CF demonstrates promising neuroprotective properties, offering protection against neuronal damage in experimental ischemic stroke models and reducing toxicity induced by Aβ aggregation. | The neuroprotective effects of CF appear to derive from several mechanisms. | Furthermore, CF provides neuroprotection by activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway, which in turn suppresses apoptosis . | The results suggest that chebulinic acid acts as a dual allosteric inhibitor, exhibiting strong binding affinities with IC50 values of 34 nM for PTPN9 and 37 nM for PTPN11. | The inhibitor showed a slow but synergistic interaction when binding to both enzymes. | molecules-29-05547-t002_Table 2Table 2Pharmacological activities of extracts and compounds from

11643381.xml,Raspberry Pomace as a Good Additive to Apple Freeze-Dried Fruit Bars: Biological Properties and Sensory Evaluation,"The bars were prepared by replacing apple puree with raspberry pomace (550), and their phenolic compounds were assessed using ethanol and buffer extracts. | This work also explored the potential bioaccessibility of phenolic compounds in enriched bars through a simulated digestion process (digest). | They are easy to store, and are also an excellent base for the production of healthy snacks, especially since they contain significant amounts of fiber, vitamins, and phenolic compounds . | On the other hand, they are very rich in biologically active compounds, especially ellagitannins and flavonoids, including anthocyanins . | An additional advantage in the production of such snacks may be the use of the freeze-drying technique, as low temperature prevents the degradation of labile compounds, especially anthocyanins. | The key parameters of the technique are temperature and time, which affect the content of bioactive compounds and the taste properties of the products. | The biological activity of polyphenols depends mainly on the changes in the human digestive system after consumption of products containing these compounds, along with the structure of the resulting metabolites. | The biological activity of phenolic compounds also includes properties resulting indirectly from anti-free radical activity, i.e., anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, or anticancer properties . | The anti-inflammatory activity of natural phenolic compounds may be explained by several mechanisms, including neutralizing free radicals, regulating the activity of cells associated with inflammation, influencing the activity of enzymes involved in the metabolism of arachidonic acid (phospholipase A2, lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenase) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), regulating the production of pro-inflammatory compounds (transcription factors, e.g., NF-κB, pro-inflammatory cytokines), or modulating the expression of pro-inflammatory genes . | The anticancer effects of phenolic compounds include, among others, protection against excess free radicals and DNA damage, promotion of apoptosis, or inhibition of growth and proliferation of cancer cells. | It is significant that these compounds have a selective proapoptotic effect on cancer cells, but do not affect the growth and division of normal cells . | Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the addition of raspberry pomace on the content of phenolic compounds and the broadly understood biologicalpro-health activity of freeze-dried appleraspberry bars. | This goal was achieved by determining the content of phenolic compounds, antioxidant activity, the impact on enzymes involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation (LOX (lipoxygenase) and COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2)), and potential antihypertensive activity (inhibition of ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme)) of ethanolic and buffer extracts obtained from bars, in which apple mousse used as a bar base was partially replaced with raspberry pomace in the amounts of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 50. | This work also attempted to determine the potential bioaccessibility of phenolic compounds from bars enriched with raspberry pomace by using a simulated digestion process. | The content of total phenolic compounds in the tested extracts of freeze-dried apple bars with the addition of raspberry pomace expressed as gallic acid equivalent increased with increasing pomace addition. | The use of different solvents for extraction can affect the content of phenolic compounds. | In turn, buffer extraction is mainly used to isolate hydrophilic compounds, which can lead to an underestimation of the amount of phenolic compounds, but can simulate the situation before digestion. | The most interesting seems to be the determination of the content of polyphenols and their antioxidant potential of samples subjected to simulated digestion, which allows the determination of the content of potentially bioavailable compounds. | Some phenolic compounds were difficult to extract from hydrophilic conditions (buffer extract); only water-soluble compounds passed into the solution. | A slightly higher content of phenolic compounds was recorded in the ethanol extracts. | The increase in the content of total phenols in digest compared with ethanolic and buffer extracts proved the release of these compounds from the food matrix. | Changes in pH and the activity of digestive enzymes may cause the release of phenolic compounds bonded to carbohydrates, increasing their potential bioaccessibility. | However, this did not change the fact that, after in vitro digestion, the concentration of phenolic compounds was about 2 to 4 times higher than before. | BAC values below 1 are intended to indicate the high efficiency of digestion in releasing phenolic compounds from the food matrix. | This group of phenolic compounds is sensitive to the changing of pH, as occurs during digestion. | The identification of polyphenolic compounds in the control bars and the bars fortified with raspberry pomace is presented in Table 1. | The identification of polyphenolic compounds in freeze-dried apple bars enriched with raspberry pomace was made based on the analysis of characteristic spectral data. | Twelve polyphenolic compounds were identified in the bars, the spectral properties of which are presented in Table 1. | UPLC-PDA-MS-MS analysis showed that five polyphenolic compounds were identified in the control bars without additives, four of which were representatives of phenolic acids: caffeic acid glucoside, chlorogenic acid, coumaric acid glucoside, coumaryl-quinic acid (compounds 912), and one belonging to the group of flavonolskaempferol pentoside-rhamnoside (compound 8). | Among the analyzed compounds, chlorogenic acid had the highest concentration (7.48 0.24 mgL). | In the fortified bars, the concentration of these compounds gradually decreased as part of the apple mousse was replaced with raspberry pomace. | In the enriched bars, among the phenolic acids, the presence of ellagic acid pentoside (compound 7) was also found, the concentration of which increased from 1.46 0.02 mgL in BP5 to 12.73 0.09 mgL in BP50. | In the fortified bars, the two main groups of compounds, characteristic of raspberries, were ellagitannins and anthocyanins. | Among the ellagitannins identified were bis-HHDP-glucose, dimer of galloyl-bis-HHDP-glucose (sanguiin H-6), galloyl-bis-HHDP-glucose (compounds 46), of which the dominant one was galloyl-bis-HHDP- glucose (from 39.64 0.70 mgL in BP5 to 286.15 9.47 mgL in BP50). | Among the group of anthocyanin dyes, three cyanidin derivatives (compounds 13) were identified, i.e., cyanidin 3-O-glucoside-5-O-glucoside, cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, and cyanidin 3-O-rutinoside. | Such low values indicate a very high bioaccessibility of compounds with the ability to neutralize free radicals. | The REF(BD) coefficients were close to 1, which meant that compounds previously associated with cellular structures may have been released during digestion, but they did not exhibit very strong chelating properties. | Changes in pH and enzymatic hydrolysis during in vitro digestion may cause changes in the structure of phenolic compounds, modifying their ability to chelate Fe2. | This may mean that the compounds released after simulated digestion from raspberry pomace do not increase the chelating activity of the active ingredients found in apples. | Cyclooxygenase-2 generates pro-inflammatory compounds; hence, natural food products with the ability to inhibit its activity are still in demand. | In the case of this enzyme, the weakest inhibitory properties were demonstrated by the buffer extracts; however, no linear relationship was found between the EC50 value and the amount of pomace added to the bars. | During digestion, phenolic compounds may be released from the food matrix, along with glycosidic bond hydrolysis and the formation of flavonoid and anthocyanin aglycones, whose inhibitory activity towards COX-2 may be stronger. | The BP30 sample showed the strongest inhibitory properties. | Probably, in the BP50 sample, the extractability of phenolic compounds could have been lower due to the higher share of raspberry seeds. | This may have been the reason for the limited release of polyphenols or the saturated ACE-inhibitory effect. | Biologically active compounds present in the analyzed extracts showed diversified antiproliferative activity. | The inhibitory concentration (EC50) values were calculated from semi-logarithmic doseresponse curves by linear interpolation. | Analysis of ethanol extracts showed that a 5 addition of pomace was too small to improve or enhance the antiproliferative activity of biologically active compounds from apples. | 2.5. Correlation Analysis In the case of ABTS radical neutralization capacity, a high positive correlation was observed for all the determined groups of phenolic compounds in all extracts (r 0.84), except for phenolic acids in the buffer extract, where r 0.159. | High and medium correlation coefficients were determined in all extracts between the content of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, phenolic acids, and anthocyanins and the ability to inhibit the activity of enzymes involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation, i.e., LOX and COX-2. | Negative values resulted from the inhibitory activity being expressed as an EC50 value, i.e., the lower the value, the higher the ability to inhibit the enzyme. | In the case of the relationship between the content of individual groups of phenolic compounds and antiproliferative activity, high and very high correlations were noted in the ethanol extracts. | Attention was also paid to the effectiveness of enriching food products in the context of the potential bioavailability of phenolic compounds. | By analyzing the content of total phenolic compounds, it was found that enriching freeze-dried apple bars with raspberry pomace significantly increased the content of these compounds in all the extracts tested (ethanolic, buffer, and digest). | The content of phenolic compounds in the control product resulted solely from their presence in the apple pulp. | The use of waste products (such as fruit pomace), which are a source of bioactive compounds with significant nutritional and pro-health values, as natural additives in the food industry fits perfectly into the idea of sustainable development in food production. | The addition of raspberry pomace significantly enriched the pool and diversity of phenolic compounds. | The health-promoting activity of phytochemical compounds depends not only on their content in the raw material but also on their chemical structure, interactions with other compounds, and, above all, on their bioavailability, i.e., the possibility of their release from the food matrix in the human digestive tract. | The results we obtained indicated that both the concentration of total phenolic compounds, flavonoids, phenolic acids, and antioxidant activity increased after simulated digestion. | As suggested by other authors, bioaccessibility values greater than 100 may be evidence that phenolic compounds are released from the food matrix andor more complex structures are metabolized to simpler forms . | In addition, the pH of the intestinal environment and the action of bile salts can cause changes in phenolic structures, which leads to the formation of new compounds differing from the initial ones in activity and bioavailability . | Polyphenols from pomace undergo hydrolysis during digestion, which can lead to the formation of compounds with a significantly higher antioxidant potential. | The results of our studies indicated that the bar samples were potential inhibitors of both COX and LOX. | It was found that there was a strong correlation between the content of phenolic compounds and the inhibitory activity against LOX and COX. | Natural and safe inhibitors of these enzymes are sought to help reduce the effects of chronic inflammation. | Dual COXLOX inhibitors are believed to be promising novel anti-inflammatory agents . | Numerous data from the literature confirm the inhibitory activity of phenolic compounds towards COX-2 . | Also, much research indicates that phenolic compounds may inhibit both lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase simultaneously . | In our study, the greatest COXLOX inhibitory impact among the tested extracts was on the digested samples. | Probably, the gastrointestinal digestion process increased the release of phenolic compounds with anti-inflammatory activity. | These results aligned with findings from other studies that indicated an increase in LOX inhibitory capacities of in vitro digested samples compared with samples before digestion . | In our research, by using the UPLC-PDA-MSMS method, we identified and named 12 polyphenolic compounds contained in pomace bars. | Moreover, dual COX-215-LOX inhibitors can play an important role not only in the anti-inflammatory process but also in cancer prevention . | In this study, the fortified bars showed generally higher ACE inhibitory activity than the control bars. | ACE inhibition may be related to some specific phenolic compounds included in fruit additives. | In the study by Erkaya-Kotan (2020), it was observed that the ACE inhibitory activity values obtained for yoghurt with a 1 addition of orange fibers (OF) were higher than those for yoghurts with 1.5 and 2 OF (p 0.05). | This was interpreted as a binding interaction between phenolic compounds and milk proteins, which led to a decrease in the bioavailability of polyphenols in yoghurt as ACE inhibitors . | In this study, we also observed that the extraction method affected ACE inhibitory activity. | The higher anti-ACE activity of the digested samples could be attributed to the phenolic composition and synergistic effect of several bioactive compounds present in the hydrolysates (proteins, peptides, unsaturated fatty acids) . | Numerous scientific studies indicate the anticancer potential of biologically active compounds, both from whole fruit and from pomace obtained from apples and different berries . | COX colorimetric inhibitor screening assay kit was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). | 4.4. Preparation of Extracts Ethanol extracts were prepared to obtain the maximum amount of phenolic compounds and their identification. | 4.5. Phenolics Analysis 4.5.1. Determination of Total Phenolic Compounds (TPCs) In the determination of total phenolic compounds by the FolinCiocalteau method, the phenolic compounds present in the sample were oxidized, while the salts of phosphomolybdic and phosphotungstic acids, which are components of the Folin reagent, were reduced in an alkaline environment. | This method used the ability of phenolic compounds to react in color with the Folin reagent, and the resulting product was blue. | The concentrations of total phenolic compounds were read from a standard curve prepared for gallic acid, and the obtained results were converted to gallic acid equivalent (GAE mg GAmL) . | 4.5.2. Determination of Individual Polyphenols from AppleRaspberry Bars A Waters ACQUITY UPLC-PDA-MSMS system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) with a BEH C18 column (100 mm 2.1 mm i.d., 1.7 μm, kept at 50 OC, Waters) was used to analyze the polyphenolic compounds. | The separation was carried out using the following solvent system: for the anthocyanin2 formic acid in water (mobile phase A) and 2 formic acid in 40 ACN in water (mobile phase B); for other polyphenolic compounds, a lower concentration of 0.1 formic acid was used. | 4.6. Antioxidant Activity 4.6.1. Determination of the Ability to Neutralize Free Radicals ABTS The spectrophotometric measurement of the ability to neutralize free radicals is based on the ability of antioxidant compounds to neutralize the cation radical generated by ABTS (2,2-azobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonate) diammonium salt) under the influence of sodium persulfate, which is manifested by a decrease in the absorbance of the analyzed solution . | 4.7. Theoretical Calculations of Potentially Bioaccessible Phenolic Compounds The relative extractability factor (REF) was calculated for the content of individual groups of phenolic compounds and their antioxidant activities. | 4.8. Enzyme Inhibition 4.8.1. Potential Anti-Inflammatory Properties Lipoxygenase (LOXI) inhibitory assay and cyclooxygenase-2 (COXI-2) inhibitory assay was performed by the procedure described earlier . | The ability to inhibit cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) was determined with the use of the COX colorimetric inhibitor screening assay kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). | 4.8.2. Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitory (ACEI) Assay ACE inhibitory activity was measured using the o-phthalaldehyde spectrophotometric assay according to the method of Jakubczyk et al. | The Pearson correlation analysis, performed using Microsoft Excel 2010, was used to indicate a relationship between the content of phenolic compounds and the biological activity of bars enriched with freeze-dried raspberry pomace. | Conclusions Results from this study indicate the importance of the apple food matrix, which may also contain bioactive compounds other than phenolics present in the apple extract. | Hence, such multidirectional actions of phenolic compounds seem to be promising in the prevention of, or even supporting the therapy of, various diseases.","EC (MISC)"

fragmentation pathways and retention time. | Thus, compound 4 could be tentatively identified as kaempferol-hexose-deoxyhexose. | Thus, according MS analysis and literature data the compounds 715 could be identified as withanolides reported in Table 1. | The optimization of UHPLC conditions achieved maximal chromatographic resolution and MS signal was crucial for accurately identify the bioactive compounds present in the in the ashwagandha-bacopa formulation. | Withanolides are marker compounds of the Solanaceae, especially in the Withania genus . | Withanolides are known for their adaptogenic properties, and their presence may explain some of the formulations effects on stress and cognitive function, this compounds may help alleviate these conditions mainly by modulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and sympathetic-adrenal medullary axes, as well as through the GABAergic and serotonergic pathways . | Bacopa monnieri is traditionally used for enhancing cognitive function, and its saponins are believed to be responsible for its neuroprotective effects, the neuroprotective activity of bacosides is linked to their role in regulating mRNA translation and the surface expression of neuroreceptors, including AMPAR, NMDAR, and GABAR, in different regions of the brain . | CoA plays a pivotal role in neuroprotection by enabling ATP synthesis essential for neuronal function, mitigating oxidative stress through ROS management, enhancing mitochondrial dynamics (e.g., fission, fusion, and biogenesis), and facilitating the clearance of damaged mitochondria to maintain cellular health . | Additionally, CoA influences gene expression via acetylation, regulates neuroinflammation, and supports neurosteroid synthesis, all of which are critical for neuronal survival . | This aligns with existing theories on the importance of mitochondrial function in neuroprotection, particularly in diseases such as Alzheimers and Huntingtons, and reinforces prior experimental evidence on bioenergetic pathways in cellular resilience. | Recent research suggests that acylcarnitines play multifaceted roles in neuroprotection. | The results provide compelling evidence for the synergistic effects of these two herbs, particularly in stress management, cognitive enhancement, and neuroprotection. | Related to neuroprotection mechanisms, the metabolomic analysis revealed that ST-65 modulates amino acid pathways, including increases in glutamate and reductions in aspartate and tryptophan use. | Glutamates role in cellular energy and neurotransmis-sion, combined with its regulated activity in the TCA cycle, supports neuronal resilience and plasticity, both crucial for neuroprotection.","ST (MISC), With (MISC), Ba (MISC), monnier (PER), SH (MISC), N (MISC), ST (MISC), ST (MISC), SH (MISC), ST (MISC)"

(2) the cyclization of amino alcohols or amino ketones, such as the cyclization of 1,4-amino alcohols under acidic or basic conditions ; and (3) the Mannich reaction, followed by cyclization and reduction . | This article highlights glycine-based decarboxylative 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition for making pyrrolidine-containing heterocyclic compounds. | The rigid yet versatile structure of indolizidine is a valuable scaffold in natural products and drug molecules as neurotransmitter modulators, enzyme inhibitors, and other therapeutic compounds 2124 . | Dong group discovered that compounds 39 and 40 could upregulate eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) to enhance the Akt and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, thereby promoting glucose uptake . | Habermanns lab reported pentacyclic decahydropyrroloazepines 41 and 42 as hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B polymerase inhibitors . | The authors then performed double annulations of these three intermediates by decarboxylative intramolecular cycloaddition to obtain compounds 40af in 3553 yields (Scheme 7). | The Habermann group initially reported benzimidazole 50 and then tetracyclic indole carboxylic acid derivatives 51 and 52 as potent and high-selectivity inhibitors for HCV NS5B polymerase (Figure 5) . | The inclusion of a cyclohexyl ring and an aromatic ring bonded to a heterocyclic core is a consistent and defining characteristic of these compounds. | Habermanns group developed synthetic routes for the synthesis of both cis-pentacyclic compounds 41 and trans-pentacyclic compounds 42 by conducting the intramolecular cycloaddition of glycine to form the pyrrolidine ring . | As shown in Scheme 8, intermediates 55 were generated by the Suzuki coupling of compounds 53 and 54, followed by N-allylation with allyl bromide to form intermediates 56. | After deprotection and the Swern oxidation of 56, compounds 57 were used for intramolecular cycloaddition with glycine or N-substituted glycine 28 to form cis-pentacyclic system 58, and then products 41ab after hydrolysis of the ester group (Scheme 8);

(2) the extension of the scope of application of active components of known drugs; (3) the evaluation of the side effects and toxicity of potential drugs and new bioactive compounds; and (4) the molecular design of new potentially low-toxicity bioactive compounds based on the structures of known drugs and hit compounds. | The calculation of descriptors in these methods is based on the structural formulae and molecular diagrams of chemical compounds (2D-QSAR) and on potentially bioactive conformations of chemical structures (3D-QSAR) . | These 2D-QSAR methods, together with 3D- to 6D-QSAR methods, can be used to model biological activity where there is a need to find compounds that can either increase or decrease the enzymatic specificity of certain proteins. | The lack of reliable crystallographic data on potentially biologically active conformations of organic compounds in the active centers of proteins, such as in the case of 15-LOX inhibitors, increases the demand for 2D-QSAR methods over all other methods for modeling enzyme specificity. | These methods can be successfully applied to model the physicochemical properties of organic compounds, as noted in our previous work and in the work of others. | Regardless of the version, this program has proved its worth in modeling different types of biological activity and a number of physicochemical properties (lipophilicity, biotransformation factor, antioxidant activity) in a number of heterogeneous organic compounds, as reported both by its developers and by us in previous works . | The purpose of the present work was to study the quantitative structureactivity relationship of 15-LOX inhibitors in a series of homo- and heterocyclic compounds with common structural formulae IXVI (Figure 1) using the GUSAR 2019 program and to build statistically significant valid prediction models for the pIC50 parameter designed to search for new potentially efficient 15-LOX inhibitors in virtual libraries and databases. | All of these models are designed to predict the numerical values of the pIC50 parameter for LOX inhibitors. | They were automatically calculated in GUSAR 2019 software based on a comparison of the experimental values of the pIC50 parameter for the LOX inhibitors and the values predicted by these models. | In addition, metrics designed to evaluate the prediction errors of the pIC50 values (RMSE, MAE, SD) were used to determine the true prediction quality index of the pIC50 parameter based on the M1M18 models for the test sets TS1TS2 of the compounds . | In addition, the predictive ability of the M10M18 models was evaluated using the structures of the LOX inhibitors contained in the internal test set TS2. | In addition, the predictive ability of the M3, M6, M9, M12, M15 and M18 models was evaluated by comparing the experimentally determined (see Section 2.2) and calculated values of the pIC50 parameter for the structures of LOX inhibitors 18 (see Figure 2) contained in the test set TS3. | These were calculated using Xternal Validation Plus 1.2 software for 100 and 95 of the structures of the 15-LOX inhibitors contained in the training sets TrS1TrS2 and test sets TS1TS2, respectively. | Tables S2S6 in the Supplementary Materials present the full set of criteria calculated using Xternal Validation Plus 1.2 software for the TrS1TrS2 and TS1TS2 sets, considering both 100 and 95 of the 15-LOX inhibitor structures contained therein. | Figure 3 shows correlations between the experimental and calculated values of the pIC50 parameter for the 15-LOX inhibitors contained in the TrS1 set, as an example of the high predictive power of our QSAR models M1M9. | The same model, based on the data in the tables, is characterized by minimum values of error and standard deviation in the prediction of the pIC50 parameter for the structures of the 15-LOX inhibitors included in the TrS2 set. | The data of Table 3 and Tables S4S6 in the Supplementary Materials allow us to conclude that almost all the QSAR models built by us are characterized by a moderate predictive ability and the absence of systematic errors in predicting the target property for the structures of 15-LOX inhibitors contained in test sets TS1TS2. | The highest numerical values of different types of coefficients of determination in predicting the pIC50 parameter for 100 of the 15-LOX inhibitor structures contained in TS1 were demonstrated by the M14 model. | The minimum values of the determination coefficients in combination with the maximum values of the prediction errors of the pIC50 parameter for the 15-LOX inhibitors corresponded to the M11 model. | In this case, like in the case of 100 data in TS2, the M13 model provided the largest numerical values of different types of coefficients of determination and the smallest values of pIC50 prediction errors for the 15-LOX inhibitors, with the exception of SD, whose numerical value was the smallest for the M17 model. | 2.2. Experimental Determination of the IC50 Parameter Against 15-LOX for Compounds 18 The results of the in vitro analysis of the inhibitory activity of a series of 2H-(benzo)pyran-2-one derivatives, 18, against 15-LOX are presented in Table 4 and Figure 4. | The inhibitory activity against 15-LOX was experimentally determined for compounds 18. | The values of semi-efficient inhibitory concentration are in the range of 2473 μmolL, which allows us to classify these compounds as moderate inhibitors of the enzyme. | As can be seen from the plot (Figure 4), a sharp change in inhibitory activity was observed in a narrow concentration range for compounds 7, 8, which can serve as a basis for the assumption that the enzyme is highly sensitive to these inhibitors. | 2.3. Evaluation of the Predictive Ability of the M3, M6, M9, M12, M15 and M18 Models Based on Compounds 18 in the Test Set TS3 Subsequently, the consensus models M3, M6, M9, M12, M15 and M18 were used to predict the numerical values of the pIC50 parameter for compounds 18 from the TS3 set. | The results of these calculations in comparison with the experimental values of the pIC50exp parameter and the 2RMSEP criterion, which corresponded to 100 and 95 of the data from the TS1 and TS2 sets, respectively, for these compounds are shown in Table 5 and Table 6. | It should be noted that all the tested compounds were within the range of applicability of the M3, M6, M9, M12, M15 and M18 models. | These models were selected for the prediction of the pIC50 parameter for 15-LOX inhibitors 18 because each of these consensus models included 320 partial regression relationships, which makes it possible to take into account the structural characteristics of each of the tested compounds in the most objective and complete way. | In addition, it was of scientific interest to explore the applicability of these models with a satisfactory and worst case predictive performance, judging by the statistical criteria derived from TS1TS2, to predict the target property for new compounds not included in the modeling. | The data in Table 5 and Table 6 allow us to conclude that almost all numerical values of pIC50 for compounds 18 predicted by the M3, M6, M9, M12, M15 and M18 models fall within the 95 confidence interval equal to 2RMSE, i.e., the difference between the predicted and experimentally determined values of the pIC50 parameter for 15-LOX inhibitors 18 does not numerically exceed the minimum value of the 2RMSEP criterion for each of the models (see Table 5 and Table 6). | The M3 model showed the highest prediction error by this criterion when the pIC50 parameter was predicted for compound 4, but even in this case the difference between the experimental and theoretically predicted values of the pIC50 parameter fell within the 2RMSEP range. | However, the same model (M3) showed the smallest prediction error of the pIC50 parameter for compound 8. | This demonstrates the good predictive ability and correctness of our constructed models, as well as the applicability of the GUSAR 2019 program for modeling 15-LOX inhibitors. | Thus, all the QSAR consensus models M1M18 are characterized by a high descriptive and moderate predictive power when comparing experimental and predicted values of pIC50 based on TrS1 and TrS2 training set structures, external and internal test sets TS1 and TS2, and compounds 18. | These models can be used for the virtual screening of virtual libraries and databases to search for new 15-LOX inhibitors in the series of homo- and heterocyclic compounds with common structural formulae I-XVI. | Research Methods The simulation procedure was performed for the compounds whose formulas are shown in Figure 1. | 3.1. The Methodology of the Computational Experiment QSAR modeling of 15-LOX inhibitors with general structural formulae IXVI (Figure 1) was performed using the GUSAR 2019 (General Unrestricted StructureActivity Relationships) computer program . | The structure set S1 contained 100 15-LOX inhibitors with their corresponding pIC50 values. | The pIC50 parameter for each compound included in the data set S1 (and the training TrS1TrS2 and test sets TS1TS2 generated from it) was calculated as the negative decimal logarithm of its corresponding IC50 value (in molL). | Numerical IC50 values for the 15-LOX inhibitors being modeled were measured experimentally and are given in . | The complete list of organic compounds from which the data set S1 was generated, with their corresponding pIC50 characteristics, is presented in Table S8 in the Supplementary Materials. | QSAR models M1M9 were built using the TrS1 training set, which contained 84 structures of 15-LOX inhibitors with their corresponding values of the pIC50 parameter. | To test the predictive ability of the M1M9 models, a test set TS1 containing 16 15-LOX inhibitors with their corresponding values of the pIC50 parameter was used. | Both sets were obtained by partitioning the data set S1, in which all compounds were previously ranked in ascending order of the pIC50 parameter, in a 5:1 ratio. | The structures were partitioned into the training set TrS1 and the test set TS1 by transferring every sixth compound from the data set S1 to TS1. | The remaining 84 structures of the 15-LOX inhibitors were used to form the training set TrS1. | The TrS2 set contained 70 15-LOX inhibitors with their corresponding values of the pIC50 parameter. | The data in these tables indicate that the compounds of the training and test sets are fairly evenly distributed over the entire range of pIC50 variation. | At the same time, the range of variation of the pIC50 parameter for the 15-LOX inhibitors included in training sets TrS1TrS2 and test sets TS1TS2 exceeds the ΔpIC50 value of 3 (i.e., ΔpIC50 3), which determines the correctness of the further QSAR modeling process . | The structures of the compounds in the training and test sets TrS1TrS2 and TS1TS2 were plotted in Marvin Sketch 23.4 software and then converted to SDF format using Discovery Studio Visualizer v24.1 software . | These descriptors are generated based on the structural formulae of the chemical compounds without using any pre-compiled list of structural fragments . | The stability of the models was tested by using a sliding control procedure, with a 20-fold randomized release of 20 of the compounds from the training samples TS1 and TS2. | At the same time, the M1, M4, M7, M10, M13 and M16 models were based on QNA descriptors and three additional descriptors that describe the topological length, topological volume and lipophilicity of the modeled 15-LOX inhibitors. | The internal verification of the M1M6 models was performed using LMO cross-validation (QLMO2), with 20 of the compounds excluded from the training sets. | Thus, the permissible range of variation for the MAE parameter was estimated considering the range of variability in the pIC50 parameter for the compounds in training sets TrS1 and TrS2, using the following formulas: MAE 0.1 pIC50if the criterion is met, then the models are characterized by a high predictive ability. | Additionally, the predictive ability of the QSAR M1M18 models was evaluated by comparing the predicted pIC50 values with the experimental values of the same parameter for the new promising 15-LOX inhibitors 18 contained in the TS3 test set (Figure 2). | These compounds were missing in the S1 data set and, accordingly, did not participate in the consensus models. | Biological tests of the inhibitors of 15-LOX 18 (Figure 2) were performed at the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics under the supervision of M.V. Kanevsky, PhD., at the Saratov State University. | Quercetin, a well-known inhibitor of 15-LOX, was employed as the positive control. | The activity of 15-LOX in the presence of the compounds studied was evaluated by a spectrophotometric recording of changes in the concentration of 13-hydroperoxylinoleic acid, the product of oxidative transformation of linoleic acid , using a LEKI SS2110UV two-beam scanning spectrophotometer (CJSC LOIP, Saint-Petersburg, Russia). | In order to study the inhibitory activity of the compounds, they were added to the sample as solutions in DMSO. | The percentage of activity inhibition by compounds 18 was determined as a relative decrease in the optical density of the solution, using Formula (1):(1)IDcDtDc100, where Dc is the optical density index of the control sample 90 s after the start of the reaction and Dt is the optical density index of the sample containing the test compound 90 s after the start of the reaction. | The range of working concentrations of compounds 18 was 1100 µM. | The IC50 values of compounds 18 were determined using linear interpolation between the points closest to 50 inhibition by means of Microsoft Excel 2016. | Conclusions Using the QSAR methodology implemented in the GUSAR 2019 program, a quantitative structureinhibitory activity relationship has been found for a series of 100 15-LOX inhibitors based on a series of derivatives of phenol, resorcinol, anacardic acid, dimethoxybenzene, alkyl ester of 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid, 1,3-diarylprop-2-yn-1-one, proline, pyrrole, alkyl ester of 2-methylfuran-3-carbonyl acid, ketoprofen, naphthalene, 1,4-di-N-oxide of quinoxaline, isoflavone, 4-hydroxy-2-(phenylmethyl)benzofuran and coumarin with the general structural formulas IXIV. | These compounds showed various degrees of inhibition of the catalytic activity of 15-LOX. | The reliability of the prediction of the pIC50 parameter based on the evaluation of this parameter for compounds of two test samples and ten subsequently experimentally studied compounds showed the moderate predictive ability of the QSAR M1M18 models. | The satisfactory match of the theoretically calculated pIC50pred values with the experimental pIC50exp values for the compounds of test sets TS1TS2 and compounds 18 opens up prospects for the application of the M1M18 models in the virtual screening of virtual libraries and databases in the search for new potentially efficient 15-LOX inhibitors in these sources.","L (MISC), G (MISC), ##USAR (ORG), 2019 (MISC), L (MISC), L (MISC), EC (MISC), L (ORG)"

11643845.xml,Characterization of Walnut Oil and Evaluation of Its Neuroprotective Effects in an In Vitro Model of Parkinson’s Disease,"This study examines the neuroprotective and antioxidant effects of walnut oil (WO), extracted from Juglans regia L., in an in vitro PD model using the neurotoxin rotenone (ROT). | WO, rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including linoleic acid (LA) and α-linolenic acid (ALA), together with minor bioactive components, is known for its neuroprotective properties. | Among these, natural antioxidant compounds have gained attention for their potential benefits. | In this regard, WO is of particular interest, as it is well known for being rich in natural antioxidant compounds due to its high percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), contributing to approximately 70 of the percentage (ww) of the entire oil composition, together with the presence of micro-components such as tocopherols, phytosterols, squalene, and polyphenols which correspond to enhanced antioxidant activity. | All the compounds found in WO contribute to significant health benefits in humans . | Rotenone (ROT) is a lipophilic compound derived from tropical plants that can cross the bloodbrain barrier (BBB). | This makes ROT an ideal model for studying neuroprotection in PD. | Given these properties, the focus of our study was to investigate the potential role of Juglans regia (walnut oil), a phytochemical extract that is abundant in PUFAs and other antioxidant components and known for its powerful neuroprotective effects. | Our research aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective and antioxidant effects of WO in an in vitro PD model using the neurotoxin ROT to induce neurodegeneration. | Moreover, to explore whether microglial cells could provide neuroprotection to neurons, we used conditioned media (CM) from ROT-treated HMC3 cells and applied them to SH-SY5Y cells. | Cell viability was measured at multiple time points to track the effects over time and to obtain pharmacokinetic data regarding WO for the assessment of better conditions for neuroprotective recovery from damage. | These findings guide the selection of optimal conditionsROT concentration, WO concentration, and treatment durationfor evaluating the neuroprotective effects of WO in this PD model with HMC3 cells. | 2.8. Combined Effects of Rotenone and Walnut Oil Treatment on SH-SY5Y Cells To evaluate the potential neuroprotective effect of WO against rotenone-induced toxicity, the SH-SY5Y cells were treated with 20 µM rotenone, a concentration known to significantly decrease cell viability, in combination with 125 μgmL of WO. | Given this context, plant-based compounds like WO are being explored for their potential neuroprotective effects as novel therapeutic strategies for preventing and treating PD. | This research utilizes both in vivo and in vitro models to assess the efficacy of these compounds in mitigating disease progression. | Notably, immunoreactivity for glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) was elevated in dopaminergic neurons treated with DHA in an MPTP model compared to those treated with MPTP alone . | At the cellular level, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) was shown to enhance brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in SH-SY5Y cells exposed to MPP . | ROT, a commonly used neurotoxin for PD modeling, allows the observation of key PD features, including motor deficits, catecholamine depletion, and α-synuclein inclusions, making it valuable for neuroprotection studies. | In previous in vivo studies using Drosophila melanogaster, we examined the neuroprotective effects of WO, chosen for its high PUFA content. | We also treated SH-SY5Y cells with conditioned media from HMC3 cells exposed to ROT andor WO to investigate the microglial influence on neuronal survival in a non-contact co-culture environment. | While these results were obtained under different conditions, they suggest that higher omega-3 PUFA intake may confer neuroprotection against oxidative damage . | Other studies have investigated the neuroprotective effects of PUFAs on SH-SY5Y cells, such as Alarcon-Gil et al. | , who pretreated SH-SY5Y cells with linoleic acid and found neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects following exposure to 6-OHDA. | Our results align with previous studies examining the impact of BV-2 cell conditioned media on SH-SY5Y cells for other protective compound classes . | Our findings also indicate that in this in vitro model, supplementation with PUFAs from WO exhibits a neuroprotective effect against ROT-induced neurotoxicity. | The antioxidant and neuroprotective properties of WO, which is rich in PUFAs, were evaluated, demonstrating efficacy at the cellular level in reducing cytotoxicity and intracellular ROS production in both HMC3 and SH-SY5Y cell lines following exposure to the neurotoxin ROT. | However, the unsaponifiable fraction, comprising less than 1 of the oil, contains a diverse array of bioactive minor constituents, including tocopherols, phytosterols, and phenolic compounds. | Evidence on the neuroprotective action of the lipid component of WO comes from our previous research on a PD model on Drosophila in which it was highlighted that a WO supplementation in the diet was able to change the profile of lipids and, in particular, of PUFAs in the heads of flies. | However, to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying WOs neuroprotective action, future experiments should focus on the specific contributions of its omega-3 fatty acids, such as alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), in PD models. | Furthermore, research on the role of tocopherols and other minor bioactive compounds present in WO is necessary to clarify their relative contributions to its overall effects. | Such studies will be crucial for distinguishing the specific roles of fatty acids in neuroprotection. | Our focus was addressed mainly on fatty acids contribution to WOs neuroprotective role.","Parkinsons (MISC), PD (MISC), Juglan (MISC), L (MISC), PD (MISC), PD (MISC), PD (MISC), Parkinsons (MISC), PD (MISC)"
11643848.xml,Structure-Activity of Plant Growth Bioregulators and Their Effects on Mammals,"It is possible to distinguish between bioregulators and regulators due to the significance of the compounds mentioned above in biochemistry and agrobiology. | As a result, natural chemical compounds derived from biosynthetic processes will be known as plant growth bioregulators (PGBRs). | In low doses, these compounds influence the processes of growth, differentiation, and development known as morphogenesis (for example, germination, sprouting, blooming, fertilization, and ripening). | Initially, it was considered that these compounds lacked protein receptors. | Logically, it is necessary to distinguish between plant growth bioregulators (PGBRs)for compounds formed by biosynthesis in plant cellsand plant growth regulators (PGRs)for compounds synthesized in the laboratory. | So, the designations of PGBRs will be used for biosynthesis compounds present in plants: PGRs for compounds obtained by synthesis and administered in agriculturalhorticultural practice. | 2.1. Abscisic Acid Abscisic acid (ABA) is a classical growth inhibitor found Acer pseudoplatanus buds by Eagles and Wareing in 1963, and named dormin . | Both compounds are often named abscisic acid. | The stems, leaves, fruits, and seeds of plants produce this growth inhibitor. | Semiochemicals are physiologically active compounds that help spread information across organisms. | Witchweed (Striga spp., OrobanchaceaeScrophulariaceae) and broomrape (Orobanche spp., Orobanchaceae) are parasitic weeds that rely solely on allelopathic compounds . | Turgorins Ricca found in 1916 that compounds in plant extracts may cause leaf motion in Mimosa pudica. | Biological Activity of Plant Growth Bioregulators Due to the large number of papers related to the function of PGBRs, it is quite difficult to emphasize all the functions of these compounds. | 3.7. Jasmonates The basic purpose of jasmonic acid and its related compounds is to control plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, in addition to growth and development. | When insects attack plants, they respond by releasing jasmonates, which promote the development of protease inhibitors and other anti-herbivore defensive chemicals. | Effects of Plant Growth Bioregulators on Mammals The interaction between the human body and the many compounds that constitute tissues and cells, also known as chemical xenobiotics, is especially interesting in terms of the evolutionary impact. | ABA has a neurotrophic impact on the mammalian central nervous system and is linked to sleep, melancholy, pain, and memory . | ABA is found in the brains of several animals and has neuroprotective properties. | Activity diagrams were used to compute the inhibitory I50 values of substances. | According to the findings, IAA is an activator as opposed to an inhibitor. | Activity percentage plots were used to calculate the IC50 values of the compounds that produced inhibition. | They also shown neuroprotective properties. | It has been demonstrated that cytokinin ribosides, in addition to cytokinin bases, also exhibit neuroprotective properties. | Trans-, cis-zeatin, kinetin, iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO), and necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin 1 (NEC-1) all markedly decreased the rate of cell death in the Glu-induced model. | Studies using lactate dehydrogenase showed that DFO and NEC-1 had a greater neuroprotective impact on neurons than cytokinins. | The sensitivity of skeletal muscle tissue to insulin is enhanced by SIRT1 activators, particularly plant polyphenols, like resveratrol. | The positive effects of these compounds were mainly highlighted.",""
11643850.xml,Potential Protective Effects of Pungent Flavor Components in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Studies have shown that some plant extracts with pungent flavor components have a certain neuroprotective effect in neurodegenerative diseases, and their mechanisms mainly involve inhibiting neuronal apoptosis, promoting neuronal regeneration, reducing mitochondrial degeneration, and reducing the production of oxides such as reactive oxygen species in cells, which are of great significance for exploring the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. | The approved treatments for AD include two cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine . | There is also a lack of known biomarkers for PD; the diagnostic rate will be greatly improved by the discovery of specific biomarkers, and in the future it should be possible to recognize PD in the prodromal phase and implement neuroprotective interventions before the onset of motor symptoms . | Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitorsnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSRIsSNRIs) and benzodiazepines, on the other hand, are used to treat the psychiatric symptoms of HD, and the dementia associated with HD can be treated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors . | However, it has been found that some plant extracts with special pungent odors have certain neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative diseases, and their mechanisms mainly involve inhibiting neuronal apoptosis, promoting neuronal regeneration to reduce mitochondrial degeneration and inactivation, and decreasing the production of oxidants such as reactive oxygen species in cells, which may offer new hope for protection against these diseases. | Therefore, in this review, we focus on the mechanisms of the neuroprotective effects of stimulating flavor components, such as capsaicin, piperine, curcumin, cannabinoids, and allicin. | Furthermore, we discuss the inhibitory effects of piperine on AKTmTORC1 signaling, the modulatory effects of cannabinoids on the PI3KAKTmTORC 1BDNF and PPARγ pathways, and the activating effects of nicotine on the α7-nAChRErk 12 and Wntβ-catenin pathways . | CAP stimulates TRPV1-ribosomal protein 70S6 kinase (TRPV 1-p70S6K) in astrocytes, which activates the p70S6K signaling pathway and promotes the production of endogenous ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), preventing the persistent degeneration of DA in the nigral corpus striatum of rats, which alleviated motor deficits in a rat model of PD. | The above studies demonstrated the neuroprotective potential of CAP to regulate the normalization of astrocyte functions . | The neuroprotective effect of CAP was also demonstrated in a Drosophila model of PD (Table 1). | Abbreviations: CAP: capsaicin; SD: Sprague Dawley; DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide;

well as neuroprotective effects that can be directly mediated through several different biochemical pathways, enabling them to be developed as new therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative diseases . | It is particularly abundant in brain regions such as the hippocampus, cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, and is expressed in excitatory (dopaminergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) presynaptic terminals. | Many studies have shown that CB1R is neuroprotective against excitotoxicity induced by a variety of stimuli. | CB1R binding inhibits excitotoxic neurotransmission by blunting presynaptic glutamate release, which has been proposed as the main mechanism underlying CB1R-mediated neuroprotection. | Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression was induced by the selective activation of the BDNF gene promoter IV, an effect mediated by a variety of transcription factors . | The study of cannabinoids encompasses three areas of research: endogenous cannabinoids (ECBs), phytocannabinoids, and endogenous cannabinoid-like compounds . | Among the nearly 60 different phytocannabinoids identified, cannabidiol (CBD) and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinoid (Δ9-THC) have been intensively investigated for their neuroprotective effects in models of AD, PD, and HD . | Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (Δ9-THCA) may ameliorate motor deficits and prevent corpus striatum degeneration through the modulation of the PPARγ pathway, resulting in neuroprotection . | In a study using a rat model of AD in which amyloid β (Aβ) injection induced neurotoxicity, CB1R activation was observed to induce a neuroprotective effect on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons via the inhibition of voltage-gated Ca2 channels and Ca2-activated K channels . | In endogenous cannabinoid-related studies, 2-AG has been reported to activate PPAR-γ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ) and induce CB1R-dependent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in response to pro-inflammatory impairments in the neuropathology of Alzheimers disease (Figure 2). | The above findings are not consistent with the conclusion that cannabinoids have neuroprotective effects, but more studies have shown that CB1Rs expression and actions have positive effects in the treatment of PD. | The co-expression of CB1R and GPR55 led to significant neuroprotection against PD-inducing MPP toxins . | In studies on endogenous cannabinoids, the endogenous cannabinoid 2-AG showed neuroprotective effects against PD-inducing neurotoxins, similar to the effects of cannabinoids . | In studies on phytocannabinoid extracts, direct neuroprotective effects were observed in PD-induced SH-SY5Y cell cultures treated with THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) . | Therefore, drugs that modulate ECB (endogenous cannabinoid) levels by blocking their metabolism, such as FAAH and MAGL inhibitors, are therapeutically attractive candidates . | Further studies in HD cell models showed that CB1R activation protects corpus striatum cells from excitotoxicity by increasing BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) expression via the PI3KAKT pathway . | Cannabinoids that selectively activate CB1R were neuroprotective in R62 mice (a classical genetic model of HD) and quinolinic acid-injured mice (a model driven by excitotoxic events). | Cannabinoids that selectively activate CB2R produced the same neuroprotective effect in both models, and they were also active in rats lesioned with malonate, a model with strong glial reactivity and activation of the apoptotic machinery . | Piperine Piperine, a major alkaloid, is widely distributed in nature and can be isolated from the dried fruit extract of pepper; it exhibits pleiotropic effects such as antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, bioavailability-enhancing, and fertility-related activities. | Plant-based compounds, such as curcumin extract, have shown improved bioavailability when administered together with BioPerine . | Piperine is a yellow crystalline solid compound that is biosynthesized from L-lysine and a precursor of cinnamoyl-CoA, a secondary metabolite. | Piperine is highly lipophilic and has low water solubility, and some studies have demonstrated poor pharmacokinetic properties, such as absorption, bioavailability, and bloodbrain barrier permeability; however, recent advances in pharmaceutical technology have overcome several of these limitations, including the issues of bioavailability and bloodbrain barrier permeability, improving the compounds therapeutic efficacy for diseases . | Piperine has a neuroprotective effect in AD, and some studies have shown that microemulsions can be used as piperine nanocarriers for the treatment of AD and enhance the delivery of piperine to the brain. | In addition, piperine exerted neuroprotective effects through antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory mechanisms in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine hydrochloride (MPTP)- or 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced animal models of PD . | A recent experimental study showed that, among 41 derivatives of piperine, 3b exhibited the best neuroprotective effect. | The compound 3b exerted cytoprotective effects by inhibiting ROS accumulation and restoring the mitochondrial membrane potential in PC12 cells; the mechanism may be related to the activation of Nrf2 and the expression of corresponding antioxidant proteins, through promoting the entry of Nrf2 into the nucleus, thereby activating cellular oxidative stress defenses and protecting the PC12 cells . | Tandem mass tag proteomics analysis showed that piperine had a neuroprotective effect in an SNCAα-synuclein-induced PD model, by promoting autophagy through P2RX4 activation and attenuating olfactory deficits and delayed locomotor deficits in Thy1-SNCA transgenic mice (Table 2). | Piperine ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in Lewis rats through its neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects, suggesting that piperine has a beneficial effect on the progression of EAE and can be considered as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). | Finally, piperine was found to have anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective effects in EAE by reducing caspase-3 (an apoptotic marker) and enhancing BDNF and NeuN (neuron-specific nuclear protein) expression . | Piperine, as a potent inhibitor of dihydroorotic acid dehydrogenase (DHODH), demonstrated strong prophylactic and therapeutic effects in MOG (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by restricting the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the CNS and preventing myelin and bloodbrain barrier (BBB) disruption, proving a novel role for piperine in the treatment of MS . | All of the above studies suggest that piperine has neuroprotective effects, suggesting that piperine could be an effective drug for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (Table 2). | Furthermore, it has also been shown that a combination of quercetin and piperine exerted neuroprotective effects in a rat model of PD induced by rotenone and iron supplementation through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms . | Piperine has been reported to enhance the bioavailability of various compounds, including quercetin, by inhibiting glucuronosyltransferases, P-glycoprotein, and drug-metabolizing enzymes . | Studies have shown that curcumin, in combination with piperine, can be neuroprotective in a 3-NP (3-nitropropionic acid)-induced HD model, and that piperine significantly enhances the protective effect of curcumin . | The above studies suggest that piperine can also be used as a bioavailability enhancer in combination with quercetin or curcumin, exhibiting strong neuroprotective effects (Table 2). | Piperine and its derivatives play a neuroprotective role through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, autophagy-regulating, and other mechanisms. | In addition, further exploration of its derivatives to improve the neuroprotective activity and selectivity of piperine will be of great significance for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. | AD Subject (of an Experiment)(AnimalCell) Piperine

in turmeric rhizomes, with the chemical formula C21H20O6, and its main metabolite is 1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) heptane-3,5-dione, tetrahydrocurcumin (THC) . | Meanwhile, it has been shown that AKT can phosphorylate Ser 21 of GSK-3α or Ser 9 of GSK-3β, inactivating them, thereby reducing GSK-3s inhibition of β-cyclin and nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), resulting in certain neuroprotective effects . | Based on the above signaling pathways, CUR is neuroprotective against AD. | These studies also demonstrate that CUR mediates neuroprotection in AD through a wide range of pathways; however, the chemical properties of CUR have made it difficult to conduct clinical trials . | CUR has been shown to be a neuroprotective agent. | In addition to the neuroprotective effects of CUR itself, the metabolites and derivatives of CUR are also effective in AD, and they cross the bloodbrain barrier more efficiently, showing superior protective and therapeutic effects. | The neuroprotective effects of CUR in PD are specifically characterized by the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis, the inhibition of astrocyte activation and inflammatory responses, and a reduction in α-syn synthesis and aggregation . | CUR and cyclohexylcyclohexane CNB-001, a novel pyrazole derivative of CUR and cyclohexylbisphenol A, significantly upregulated the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and attenuated the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, suggesting that CNB-001 may provide neuroprotection by modulating the function of the Bcl-2 family . | In another study, the CUR agonism of human α7-nicotine-acetylcholine receptor (α7-nAChR) decreased the mortality of DA neurons in the substantia nigra and significantly reduced 6-OHDA-induced dyskinesia in mice with PD, suggesting that the activation of α7-nAChR by CUR has neuroprotective effects in PD . | The neuroprotective effects of nicotine have been well documented. | In astrocytes cultured in vitro, nicotine treatment inhibited cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β), downregulated key inflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-8 and BuChE), and exerted neuroprotection through the activation of α7-nAChR, leading to COX-2-dependent PGE2 production, which delayed neurodegeneration . | Some studies have hypothesized an outsidein mechanism of neuroprotection, in which nicotine activates the surface nAChR, leading to Ca2 influx and transcriptional changes, such as the upregulation of FGF-2 mRNA expression (Figure 4). | The FGF-2 gene is involved in the nAChR mechanism mediating neuronal survival and nutrition, and nicotine may also mediate neuronal survival through α7-nAChR activation. | Nicotine also exerts neuroprotective effects through an insideout pharmacology. | In addition, the authors hypothesized that this process reduces the requirement for a general protease-inhibitory mechanism in the ER, thereby altering ER stress (an often-cited mechanism of toxicity in PD) and, ultimately, exerting neuroprotective effects . | It has been shown that nicotine inhibits H2O2-induced fine damage to immortalized hippocampus HT-22 cells through the activation of the α7-nAChRErk 12 signaling pathway, exerting neuroprotection through antioxidant effects . | Nicotine may exert neuroprotective effects in AD. | However, many compounds in tobacco smoke are toxic and oxidative stress inducers, rendering nicotine unable to exert neuroprotective effects. | Nicotine may play a neuroprotective role in PD. | The above data suggest that tobacco may have neuroprotective effects in PD and contain a neuroprotective substance. | Preclinical studies have shown that nicotine metabolites are norcholinergic modulators that produce beneficial effects by stimulating cholinergic neural pathways, displaying pro-cognitive and neuroprotective properties associated with the positive regulation of the cholinergic and dopaminergic systems. | A study showed that SIRT6 plays a pathogenic and pro-inflammatory role in PD, and that nicotine can provide neuroprotection by accelerating its degradation, suggesting that the inhibition of SIRT6 may be a promising strategy for ameliorating PD and other neurodegenerative diseases . | The possible therapeutic effects of nicotine are mediated through the activation of the astrocyte nAChR; astrocyte calcium mobilization decreases pro-inflammatory cytokine release and increases astrocyte glial-derived neurotrophic factor synthesis, suggesting that nAChR expressed on astrocytes may be a better therapeutic target for the treatment of PD . | These findings are consistent with a reduced responsiveness to nicotine during the prodromal phase of PD, and they also suggest that the apparent neuroprotective effect of smoking observed in epidemiological studies is due to reverse causality . | Other Substances In addition to the substances mentioned above, researchers have found that other natural plant extracts with pungent odors or tastes have similar potential neuroprotective effects. | Glucosinolates (GL) are alkaloids found in cruciferous plants that emit a pungent, irritating odor and can be hydrolyzed into neuroprotective isothiocyanates (ITCs), such as sulforaphane (SFN), the main source of the pungent odor in raw radish, and sinapic acid (EA), the source of the choking odor of mustard . | Erucamide, a bioactive fatty acid amide derivative of EA obtained from radish leaves, similarly exhibited potent acetylcholinesterase-inhibitory activity . | In addition to this, EA can be neuroprotective against AD by increasing the expression of PI3K, CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein), and ERK in neuronal cells, elevating the level of catalase, and decreasing the level of cholinesterase. | In addition, EA has been shown to be neuroprotective in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), a demyelinating lesion of the central nervous system . | Meanwhile, other studies have shown that the active ingredient of tea, EGCG, can inhibit the aggregation of α-syn, Aβ, and huntingtin, as well as participating in the regulation of neuronal inflammatory processes and the activation of pro-neuronal survival signaling pathways, which can have a certain therapeutic effect in AD, PD, and HD . | In summary, many kinds of natural plant extracts with specific odors have been found to have therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative diseases, but the evidence mainly comes from laboratory studies, and there is still a lack of sufficient preclinical and clinical studies to elaborate the neuroprotective effects of stimulant extractsa gap that urgently needs to be filled. | Discussion In this review, we describe the nature and mechanisms of action of several stimulating flavor components that protect against neurodegeneration, as well as the laboratory and clinical evidence demonstrating their neuroprotective effects. | A comparison revealed that different stimulating flavor components could exert neuroprotective effects by activating the same signaling pathways: CAP, piperine, CUR, and cannabinoids could all induce cellular autophagy by inhibiting PI3KAKTmTOR pathway activity. | The PPARγ pathway is also widely involved in the regulation of neuroprotective mechanisms. | It is hypothesized that one of the reasons that different stimulating flavor components can exert neuroprotective effects through the same signaling pathway is that certain flavor components have the same metabolites, such as THC, which is extremely efficient in neuroprotection as a metabolite of CUR and piperine. | We also found that different stimulating flavor components can act on common receptors to exert neuroprotection: both CUR and nicotine block α7-AChR, and both CAP and cannabinoids block TRVP1, which is involved in neuroprotective cell signaling . | In addition to the action of different substances on common receptors, nicotine, curcumin, and caffeine have been found to exert neuroprotective effects through intestinal mechanisms, mainly by altering the composition of the gut microbiota . | In addition, the combination of different stimulating flavor components showed synergistic neuroprotective effects: the combination of piperine with CUR and quercetin significantly enhanced the neuroprotective effects of both substances , and there was also a significant relationship between an increased intake of chili peppers and a reduced risk of PD, suggesting that the nicotine in chili peppers may have a synergistic effect with CAP, although the exact mechanism has not yet been clarified . | Currently, the neuroprotective effects of stimulant flavor ingredients have been widely and comprehensively studied, but there has not yet been a single preventive or therapeutic drug containing a stimulant flavor ingredient that has actually been applied in clinical use, mainly because the mechanism underlying the disease itself remains unclear, the mechanisms underlying the stimulant flavor ingredients protective effects have not yet been agreed upon, and there is a lack of clinical trials. | Some studies have found that pungent flavor compounds have potential protective effects in neurodegenerative diseases, which brings new hope for their treatment. | Therefore, this article summarizes the mechanisms of action of several pungent flavor compounds that have potential therapeutic effects in neurodegenerative diseases. | We identified the similarities among these pungent flavor compounds to provide a reference for the further exploration of the efficacy of these substances and the development of new drugs for neurodegenerative diseases.","Alzheimers (MISC), AD (MISC), Parkinsons (MISC), PD (MISC), Huntingtons (MISC), HD (MISC), PubMed

11643852.xml,Synthesis and Structure–Activity Relationship (SAR) Studies on New 4-Aminoquinoline-Hydrazones and Isatin Hybrids as Promising Antibacterial Agents,"The compounds were evaluated against a panel of clinically relevant antibacterial strains including the Gram-positive Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus and a Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterial strain. | Preliminary screenings revealed that several test compounds had significant antimicrobial effects, with HD6 standing out as a promising compound. | Additionally, HD6 demonstrated impressively low minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) in the range of (8128 μgmL) against the strains B. | Despite the recent introduction of several novel antibiotics and antibiotic adjuvants, including advanced β-lactamase inhibitors , these pathogens continue to present significant therapeutic challenges as we progress into the third decade of the twenty-first century. | These compounds consist of cyclic structures with at least one heteroatom. | Various compound classes have played a key role in developing antimicrobial drugs, with heterocyclic derivatives standing out as vital class of therapeutic agents for treating infectious diseases. | Quinoline, also known as 1-aza-naphthalene or benzopyridine, is a highly popular heterocyclic aromatic compound with a wide range of applications in commercial and medicinal chemistry . | Some notable drugs include Lenvatinib, an anticancer drug that acts as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor ; Tipifarnib, used in leukemia treatment as a farnesyl transferase inhibitor ; Bedaquiline, used for TB treatment by inhibiting ATP synthesis ; Saquinavir, an inhibitor targeting proteases for HIV-1 ; Pitavastatin, which lowers cholesterol and prevents heart disease as an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor ; Fluoroquinolones, which works as a DNA replication inhibitor and is used as an antimicrobial agent ; and Chloroquine, a heme polymerization inhibitor used against plasmodium . | The rationale for our study of the synthesized compounds is demonstrated in Figure 1, which provides a visual representation of the structural and functional diversity of various biologically active compounds . | We employed a molecular hybridization strategy to synthesize and evaluate novel antibacterial compounds derived from 4-aminoquinoline and isatin derivatives. | A total of 35 new compounds were synthesized and thoroughly characterized using various spectroscopic techniques. | Among the synthesized compounds, HD6 exhibited potent antibacterial properties. | We conducted comprehensive antimicrobial assessments including minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and zone of inhibition (ZOI) assays. | Additionally, a hemolytic activity assay was performed to evaluate the compounds safety profile on human red blood cells, revealing a favorable toxicity level. | All the final compounds were characterized by multispectroscopic techniques such as 1H, 13C-NMR, FT-IR, and mass spectrometry. | One representative derivative compound, HD2, is discussed here; all other derivative molecules showed a similar trend. | This further indicated the formation of the HD1-23 compounds. | The mass spectra of all the compounds (HD1-23) were found to be in agreement with the calculated values, consequently confirming, through HRMS, the formation of the desired hybrid compound. | The 1H-NMR spectra of compound HS1 was characterized under 400 MHz (δ, ppm) using DMSO-d6 as solvent. | Compound HS1 exhibited a total of 16 protons present in the compound. | Furthermore, 22 peaks were observed in the 13C-NMR (100.6 MHz, δ, ppm) spectra of compound HS1, which included a characteristic peak of -CN of imine, which appeared at 134.76. | Before performing any biological study, the mass spectra of all compounds (HS1-12) were found to be in agreement with the calculated values and were consequently confirmed by HRMS, validating the formation of the desired molecules. | Most of these compounds demonstrated favorable drug-like characteristics (Supplementary Table S1). | 2.2.2. In Vitro Screening All 4-aminoquinoline hydrazones and isatin hybrids, designated as (HD1-23 and HS1-12), respectively, were subjected to in vitro screening to assess their inhibitory efficacy against selected bacterial strains. | The screening commenced with an initial concentration of 10 mgmL as the upper limit for the classification of potent compounds. | The majority of the HD compounds exhibited measurable inhibitory zones against E. | Conversely, these compounds displayed minimal significant antimicrobial activity against B. | Notably, compounds HD1, HD4, HD6, and HD11 demonstrated good to moderate antibacterial activity across various bacterial strains. | Within the HS series, most compounds demonstrated inhibitory effects against E. | Among them, compounds HS7 and HS8 exhibited mild activity against the tested isolates. | 2.2.3. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Based on their zones of inhibition, the selected compounds HD1, HD4, HD6, HD11, HS2, HS7, and HS8 were further assessed as possible antibacterials. | In vitro screening of the compounds identified HD6 and HS8, among others, as having superior antibacterial activity against the tested bacterial strains, as shown in (Table 2). | This study concluded that HD6 and HS8 are selective inhibitors of these selective bacterial strains, warranting further investigation. | To evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of a compound, the ratios of MBC to MIC are compared. | If the MBCMIC ratio is 2, the compound is classified as bactericidal. | Conversely, a ratio between 2 and 16 suggests the compound is bacteriostatic. | (Supplementary Data Table S2) provides the MBC values and the ratios of MIC to MBC, denoted as R for HD and HS compounds against the bacterial strains, with MBC indicating the concentration required to kill 99.9 of bacteria. | In contrast, all HS compounds exhibited MBC values greater than 2 for all bacterial strains, indicating a lack of bactericidal capabilities. | 2.2.5. Disc Diffusion Assay The antibacterial effectiveness of the test compounds HD6 and HS8 were observed using the disc diffusion assay on MuellerHinton agar (MHA) plates at concentrations equivalent to their ½ MIC, MIC, and 2MIC values. | The assay demonstrated that the zones of clearance were dose-dependent, varying with the different concentrations of the two compounds used (Table 3). | Upon treatment with the compound HD6, increasing zones of inhibition were seen of 11 mm, 11 mm, and 12 mm for ½ MIC, MIC, and 2MIC, respectively, around the discs against Gram-positive S. | 2.2.6. Combination Study Table 4 provides a comprehensive in vitro analysis on the synergistic antibacterial activity of compounds HD6 and HS8 in combination with the standard antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) against four bacterial isolates. | These results suggest that the compound HD6 exhibits a strong synergistic effect (i.e., a many-fold decrease in MIC values of the test compounds) with the standard drug CIP, which might be beneficial for treating resistant bacterial strains through combination therapy. | The level of synergy between the examined compounds was assessed using the FICI (fractional inhibitory concentration index). | 2.2.7. Hemolytic Assay The in vitro toxicity of compound HD6 was evaluated through the procedure of hemolytic assay to investigate its effects on human red blood cells (hRBCs) across a range of concentrations from 50 to 800 μgmL, with ciprofloxacin as a control standard. | A total of 16 MDR strains were subjected to antimicrobial testing against the HD6 compound (Supplementary Materials Table S3). | The present study attempted to explore the potential of new 4-aminoquinoline-hydrazones and isatin-based hybrid compounds as antimicrobial agents. | Heterocyclic compounds, synthesized by the fusion of two or more active pharmacophores, have been critical towards the development of antimicrobial treatments. | The synthesized compounds demonstrated considerable antibacterial properties, with HD6 emerging as the most potent candidate. | aeruginosa (fractional inhibitory concentration index, FICI 0.37). | Future research should aim to elucidate the specific mechanisms of action of the most effective compounds, conduct in vivo studies to assess both efficacy and safety, and explore the structureactivity relationships (SAR) to optimize the pharmacological properties of these hybrids. | All compounds were purified by flash column chromatography with Combi Flash NextGen 100 (Teledyne ISCO, Lincoln, NE, USA) using a 230400 mesh silica gel purchased from Sisco Research Laboratories (Mumbai, India). | 5.1.2. General Procedure of 4-((7-Chloroquinolin-4-yl)amino)benzohydrazide (LN-2) In a dried round-bottom flask, compound LN-1 (1.0 equiv.) was dissolved in absolute ethanol followed by the addition of hydrazine hydrate (20 equiv.) dropwise. | 5.2.2. In Vitro Screening of Compounds The objective of this experiment was to assess all 35 compounds (HD1-23 and HS1-12) for their antibacterial activity against four different bacterial strains: E. | Initially, stock solutions of the test compounds were prepared at a concentration of 10mgmL in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to minimize solvent effects. | Plates were marked to identify the test compounds. | Sterile paper discs, soaked in the respective test compound solutions, were placed at predetermined distances on the agar using sterile forceps. | The antibacterial efficacies of the test compounds against the specified bacterial strains were thus determined. | 5.2.3. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) After conducting in vitro studies, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of selected compounds were determined. | Test compounds (HD1, 4, 6, 11; HS2, 7, 8) were evaluated against the four bacterial isolates using a 96-well microtiter plate. | The compounds were added to the wells containing nutrient broth, with the initial concentration set at 512 μgmL in the first column. | The MIC was determined as the lowest concentration of the compound that prevented observable bacterial growth, with all experiments conducted in biological triplicates . | 5.2.4. Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) Following the determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), a procedure was conducted to derive the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of the test compounds. | The smallest concentration that prevented bacterial growth on the medium was identified as the MBC of an examined compound. | 5.2.5. Disc Diffusion Assay Diffusion assay was carried out by using the bacterial strains to assess the potential antimicrobial properties of the selected test compounds, particularly the ones that exhibited low MIC values in comparison to the other tested compounds against the bacterial isolates, as per the NARMS . | Test compounds (HD6 and HS8) equivalent to their ½ MIC, MIC, and 2 MIC concentrations were placed onto the discs that were then stationed on plates filled with MHA and uniform bacterial smears. | Following the incubation period, the zones of inhibition (ZOIs) surrounding each disc were diligently measured in millimeters (mm) to denote the efficacy of each compound . | 5.2.6. Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index (FICI) The assessment of FICI, which assessed the potential synergistic action between the standard antibiotic ciprofloxacin and selected compounds HD6 and HS8, was facilitated through the effective application of the microdilution checkerboard procedure. | Simultaneously, a top-to-bottom dilution of each compound was devised to yield concentrations of 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, and 2 μgmL, constituting a wide range of combinations. | The degree of synergism between the tested compounds was evaluated in the context of the FICI (fractional inhibitory concentration index) using the standard formula:FICIMIC of the drug A in combination with BMIC of the drug A aloneMIC of the drug B in combination with AMIC of the drug B alone Synergy and antagonism were defined by FICI indices of 0.5 and 4, respectively. | 5.2.7. Hemolytic Assay The hemolytic potential of test compound HD6 was evaluated following a specific protocol. | For the assay, 100 microliters of the diluted suspension were transferred into microcentrifuge tubes in triplicate, each containing 100 microliters of different dilutions of the test compound, with matching buffer. | The percentage of RBCs lysed was calculated using the following formula: HemolysisOD of the test compound treated sampleOD of the buffer treated sampleOD of the 1 TritonX100 treated sampleOD of the buffer treated sample100 5.2.8. Zone of Inhibition of Environmental Resistant Strains A disc diffusion assay was conducted using multidrug-resistant strains that were taken from environmental waterbodies. | These were tested against the HD6 compound as this compound showed promising results in comparison to the other test compounds. | Notably, among all derivatives (HD1-23 and HS1-12), compound HD6 exhibited significant antibacterial efficacy, indicated by an MIC in the range of (816 μgmL) and an MBC of (8128 μgmL) against the bacterial strains E. | The docking analysis indicated favorable binding energy scores, suggesting the compounds capability to effectively inhibit bacterial growth. | Overall, these results signify the promising potential of the synthesized compound HD6 to be developed as an effective and safe antibacterial agent.","AM (MISC), HRMS (ORG), Gram (MISC), En (MISC), ##cocc (MISC), ##ci (MISC), Ba (MISC), Staph (MISC), ##oc (ORG), ##oc (MISC), Gram (MISC), P (MISC), ##udomona (MISC), B (MISC), S (MISC), P (MISC), B (MISC), C (MISC), P (MISC), MD (MISC)"

11643940.xml,Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Traumatic Injury in the Adult and Immature Brain,"Despite TBI being a global public health concern, current treatment only focuses on symptom management, and no neuroprotective agents with an aim to protect or preserve brain structure and function after injury have been approved for use in the clinic . | This review discusses the impact of interventions using omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (O3 PUFAs) as neuroprotective agents for the alleviation of the effects of TBI and summarises the evidence from preclinical and clinical studies carried out so far. | TBI is also associated with oxidative stress, which reflects an imbalance between the production of oxidation-derived free radicals (such as superoxide anions, hydroxide radicals, and hydrogen peroxide) and the scavenging of these species through cellular antioxidant systems, such as the enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase and catalase, and compounds like glutathione . | The complex cascade of mechanisms unfolding after TBI offers multiple targets for neuroprotection of the adult and immature brain, but the field of neuroprotection in TBI has somewhat lost momentum following failures in the clinical translation of experimental data . | Fatty acids (FAs) are hydrophobic compounds that consist of a hydrocarbon chain of varying length and a terminal carboxylic acid group (COOH), and they can be part of more complex lipids (e.g. phospholipids, triacylglycerol or cholesteryl esters), or be free (i.e. non-esterified) FAs (FFAs) . | Specific markers of oxidative stress post-TBI include PUFA-derived compounds produced non-enzymatically through peroxidation, such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), derived from AA, and 4-hydroxyhexenal (4-HHE), derived from DHA ; these bioactive molecules can form adducts with DNA, proteins, and lipids. | These early observations, as well as clear efficacy signals for acutely administered DHA in traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) , led to the suggestion that long-chain PUFAs such as DHA had potential for neuroprotection in traumatic neurological injury . | Multiple experimental studies have investigated the therapeutic potential of O3 PUFAs as neuroprotective interventions in TBI (summary in Table 1), and the data indicate that an O3 PUFA intervention can have an overall wide therapeutic and prophylactic scope. | A higher dose of 50 mgkg in mouse CCI, initiated immediately after injury and continued daily for 8 days, showed that DHA had some neuroprotective effects, but overall did not significantly improve inflammation or brain function within the first week post-injury . | Similarly, a regime of intraperitoneal administration of 3 mgkg DHA and 7 mgkg EPA, first administered 2 h after CCI in

studies have investigated the neuroprotective effects of O3 PUFAs by adopting regimens where supplementation was initiated prior to injury. | The effects of supplementation with fish oil for 1 month prior to injury was investigated in three studies; dietary supplementation with 8 fish oil was associated with an improvement in hippocampal neuronal survival and growth, a restoration of energy-sensing and genomic stability systems (such as silent information regulator 2 (Sir2) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)), a reduction in oxidative damage, and an improvement in learning and memory abilities , whereas there were no effects on hippocampal neuronal survival and function in a study with 6 fish oil supplementation . | Tyagi and colleagues implemented an O3-adequate diet (with 1.2 DHA and 0.24 EPA content) and compared it to a deficient diet (without DHA or EPA) in pregnant rat dams whose offspring were submitted to FPI, and noted that the deficiency worsened outcome in the elevated plus maze; decreased levels of the synaptic marker syntaxin-3, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and GAP-43 (a regeneration marker); and also amplified the expression of growth-inhibitory molecules and oxidative stress after injury . | 7.4. Interventional Studies in Humans Overall, experimental studies point towards the neuroprotective potential of O3 PUFAs in traumatic injury, with some discrepancies between studies that are likely due to differences in dosage, type of O3 PUFAs administered, mode of administration, frequency of administration, and TBI animal model used. | It is clear that the impact of these compounds on key pathophysiological mechanisms triggered by TBI (Figure 1) is significant across developmental time and animal species. | DHA-only treatments or combinations of DHA and EPA reduce cerebral oedema, apoptotic death, and neuronal loss, limit axonal injury and the loss of synaptic proteins, attenuate proinflammatory microglia and astrocytic activation, reduce oxidative stress, improve myelin preservation, and increase levels of neurotrophic factors (such as BDNF). | Over a period of 189 days, DHA supplementation significantly increased plasma DHA in a dose-dependent manner and led to an attenuated increase in serum NFL, coinciding with the active competitive season, suggesting that the prophylactic use of DHA in the high-risk population of contact sport athletes may confer neuroprotection . | A relative depletion in O3 PUFAs is particularly important to be addressed in children and adolescents, as these compounds have an important neurodevelopmental role, and decreased levels of DHA in the developing brain leads to deficits in neurogenesis and alterations in learning and visual function . | Long-chain PUFAs such as EPA and DHA have complex pharmacodynamics and a wide array of potential targets, but at present, there is little understanding regarding which receptor targets are critical for efficacy of these compounds in TBI, especially in humans. | More research is required to characterise the receptor or receptor combinations that are major mediators of the neuroprotective effects. | Linked to this aspect, and to the possibility of the beneficial effects of O3 PUFAs involving multiple receptors, it is important to note an ongoing debate in the field of neuroprotection research for neurotrauma regarding the targeting of single mechanisms, or the opposite, i.e. the use of pleiotropic compounds. | Would the use of compounds with pleiotropic effects and multiple targets have a higher chance of success? | An example of a single mechanism and target-specific neuroprotective intervention that failed in TBI is that of magnesium to block NMDA glutamate receptor-mediated toxicity . | Results showed that patients receiving the lower dose did significantly worse than those on placebo, and there was increased mortality at the higher magnesium dose compared to the placebo group, suggesting that not only was magnesium not neuroprotective but that it was potentially harmful. | In this instance, two large multicentre clinical trials showed that there was no difference in TBI outcome at 6 months, even after intervention was initiated as early as 4 h after injury, with continued administration of the compound for up to 120 h and this is in spite of numerous preclinical studies showing efficacy in TBI models . | Recent years have also seen an increase in reports of intrinsic neuroprotective effects of bioactive lipid mediators derived from long-chain O3 PUFAs. Several studies demonstrated positive neuropathological and neurobehavioural effects in experimental TBI models after the acute administration of lipid mediators such as resolvins D1 and E1 (RvD1 and RvE1, respectively), docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide (DHEA), and neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), using various administration regimens (Table 2) . | The issue of whether O3 PUFAs can be developed into a preparation with neuroprotective effects is equally important in the field of SCI. | The secondary injury cascade after traumatic injury of the spinal cord has many physiopathological similarities with TBI, and data obtained by us and other groups have shown clear potential of DHA for neuroprotection in the acute phase of SCI . | Therefore, a successful neuroprotective intervention with O3 PUFAs could address complex therapeutic challenges in injury in the CNS across a wide spectrum of unmet needs. | Brain markers: ASC: apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (caspase recruitment domain), ATP: adenosine triphosphate, BBB: bloodbrain barrier, BDNF: brain-derived neurotrophic factor, CD11b86200: cluster of differentiation 11b, 86, or 200, COX-2: cyclooxygenase-2, CytC: cytochrome C, FRP2: N-formyl peptide receptor 2, GFAP: glial fibrillary acidic protein, GLAST: glutamate aspartate transporter, GLUT13: glucose transporter 1 or 3, Iba1: ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1, IL-1β66R: interleukin 1 beta, 6 or 6R, LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3, MCP-1: monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, miR: microRNA, MnSOD: manganese superoxide dismutase, n-: neuronal, NeuN: neuronal nuclear protein, NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa B, NLRP3: NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3, NOS: nitric oxide synthase, SOD: superoxide dismutase, S100B: S100 calcium-binding protein B, TLR4: toll-like receptor 4, TNF-α: tumour necrosis factor-alpha, TRX2: thioredoxin 2, TUNEL: terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling, 3-NT: 3-nitrotyrosine. | As mentioned previously, it may also be possible to enhance the effect of O3 PUFAs by combining them with other compounds to achieve mechanistic synergism. | For example, a proprietary preparation, which is a medical multi-nutrient containing O3 PUFAs (DHA and EPA) and other compounds involved in the biosynthesis of phospholipids (which are depleted after TBI ), has shown significant effects in mouse CCI both for improved neurological outcome and for tissue protection . | Conclusions The studies reviewed here indicate that O3 PUFAs are compounds that could significantly decrease the impact of traumatic injuries of the CNS across a spectrum of severities and in both the immature and the adult brain. | Notwithstanding the remaining questions highlighted above, whose answers will help optimise the interventions, the pragmatic approach that has already led to the first interventional studies in mild TBI confirms the promise of these compounds and shows the path ahead towards a precision medicine-informed effective intervention.","T (MISC), T (MISC), T (MISC), T (MISC), T (MISC), T (MISC), T (MISC), T (MISC)"

11643984.xml,Diversity of Microglia-Derived Molecules with Neurotrophic Properties That Support Neurons in the Central Nervous System and Other Tissues,"Microglia, the brain immune cells, support neurons by producing several established neurotrophic molecules including glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). | Modern analytical techniques have identified numerous phenotypic states of microglia, each associated with the secretion of a diverse set of substances, which likely include not only canonical neurotrophic factors but also other less-studied molecules that can interact with neurons and provide trophic support. | In this review, we consider the following eight such candidate cytokines: oncostatin M (OSM), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), activin A, colony-stimulating factor (CSF)-1, interleukin (IL)-34, growthdifferentiation factor (GDF)-15, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-2. | The available literature provides sufficient evidence demonstrating murine cells produce these cytokines and that they exhibit neurotrophic activity in at least one neuronal model. | Several distinct types of neurotrophic activity are identified that only partially overlap among the cytokines considered, reflecting either their distinct intrinsic properties or lack of comprehensive studies covering the full spectrum of neurotrophic effects. | Further studies on these potential microglia-derived neurotrophic factors are warranted since they may be used as targeted treatments for diverse neurological disorders. | They maintain functional neurons, the signaling cells of the brain, by secreting neurotrophic factors. | Microglia are capable of producing a large number of molecules that act as immunomodulators, cytotoxins, or neurotrophic factors. | Microglia display phenotypic plasticity by altering their functions and morphology depending on their surrounding environment, including extracellular matrix, stimulants, inhibitors, and other cell types they encounter (reviewed in ). | Conversely, activation of inflammation-resolving pathways in microglia results in the release of anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic factors (reviewed in ). | Our review illustrates that similar to their secretion of neurotoxins, reactive microglia are likely to secrete a mixture of neurotrophic molecules, the composition of which depends on the species, nature of the stimulating agent, and the surrounding microenvironment. | 1.2. Effect of Neurotrophic Factors The growth, differentiation, and survival of developing and mature neurons are all modulated by tightly controlled exposure to neurotrophic factors (reviewed in ). | For the purposes of this review, molecules are considered neurotrophic if they have the capacity to facilitate at least one of the following processes: neuronal proliferation, differentiation of neuronal precursors, growth of pre-existing and new neuronal projections, and survival or recovery after neuronal damage. | 1.3. Microglia-Derived Neurotrophic Factors Previous literature includes a number of extensive reviews that are typically focused on a subset of microglia-derived proteins with proven and widely accepted neurotrophic functions. | They include brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), neurotrophin (NT)-3, and NT-45 (reviewed in ). | However, there are other proteins and peptides that are not yet considered prototypical microglia-derived neurotrophic factors, but experimental evidence has been collected indicating they (1) are secreted by either surveying or reactive microglia, (2) interact with neurons by binding to a corresponding receptor or receptors, and (3) this interaction leads to neurotrophic effects under certain experimental conditions. | In this review, we consider the following eight cytokines secreted by microglia that bind to distinct neuronal targets and demonstrate neurotrophic effects in vitro or in the CNS: oncostatin M (OSM), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), activin A, colony-stimulating factor (CSF)-1, interleukin (IL)-34, growthdifferentiation factor (GDF)-15, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-2 (Figure 1). | While these and several other studies suggest that OSM is likely a neuroprotective molecule, its neurotrophic activity in both murine and human models requires more detailed investigations. | One of them is the glycoprotein (gp)130α, and the other can be either an OSMRß or leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR)ß subunit . | OSMR1 consists of a gp130α and a leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR)ß subunit, while OSMR2 is composed of the same subunits as the murine OSMR . | The ubiquitous presence of gp130α mRNA has been reported for both murine and human excitatory and inhibitory neurons , and in C57BL6 mice, there is evidence of gp130 protein expression by CNS neurons . | B-27 supplement-deprived primary murine cortical neurons exposed to OSM demonstrate increased viability compared to untreated cells, indicating that OSM may possess neuroprotective activity. | Similarly, in a rat model of ischemic stroke induced by left MCAO, intracerebral injection of hOSM promotes neuronal survival and reduces the severity of neurological deficits such as impaired reflexes, lost balance, and decreased grip strength compared to animals not treated with this cytokine . | Furthermore, the intracellular signaling mechanisms responsible for the neurotrophic effects of OSM need to be established. | Future studies should focus on the Janus kinase (JAK)signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway since it is activated by binding of OSM to OSMR complexes in murine neurons . | Leukemia Inhibitory Factor 3.1. Overview of Structure and Function Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a 20 kDa pleiotropic cytokine belonging to the IL-6 cytokine family. | Further research into the responses of human cells and tissues to LIF is required to fully elucidate the neurotrophic properties of this molecule. | Administration of nicardipine, a Ca2 channel blocker, inhibits the neurotrophic effect of activin A, as does treatment with cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor. | These neuroprotective effects are observed after 8 days and 8 weeks . | In a control experiment with an identical timeline, ICV injection of saline, followed by ICV infusion of activin A, increases neuronal proliferation, indicating that activin A has neurotrophic effects in both pathological and physiological conditions. | While this in vitro study is indicative of the neuroprotective effects of activin A on human neurons, the neurotrophic effects of activin A in the human brain or on human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons have not yet been elucidated, and further studies are required. | Although the actions of CSF-1 on neurons remain to be fully characterized, it exhibits certain neurotrophic and protective activity toward this cell type (reviewed in ). | In the resting state, CSF1R is in an inactive autoinhibitory conformation. | Activation of CSF1R involves exposure of the autoinhibitory juxtamembrane region to the cytoplasm, resulting in the receptor adopting an active extended conformation . | The CREB signaling pathway has already been linked to improved neuronal survival in mice and, therefore, could be responsible for the neurotrophic effect of CSF-1, but this hypothesis will require experimental proof in both mice and humans . | Interestingly, the maximal neurotrophic effect of CSF-1 in rat hippocampal neurons is achieved at 1 ngmL but a ten-times higher concentration of this cytokine is needed to induce the maximal protective response in cortical neurons. | In summary, exposure of cultured rat neurons isolated from different brain regions to hCSF-1 results in improved cell survival, proliferation, and neurite outgrowth, helping establish the neurotrophic role of this cytokine . | While there is a lack of evidence for the protective actions of hCSF-1 on human neurons, the neurotrophic activity of this cytokine has been studied in murine tissues. | However, the neuroprotective function of CSF-1 is not limited to KA-induced injuries. | Delivery of exogenous microencapsulated hCSF-1 to the site of injury facilitates neuronal survival and reduces infarct size resulting from surgically induced ischemic lesions in the murine cerebral cortex. | Due to its relatively recent discovery, many aspects of IL-34 biological activity remain poorly understood; however, its neurotrophic and protective effects in the CNS have been observed. | Direct evidence of neuroprotective and neuron survival-promoting properties of IL-34 has also been collected . | The neuroprotection offered by IL-34 is comparable to that of systemically administered recombinant hCSF-1 in the same murine model of neuronal damage . | Given the neurotrophic effects of IL-34 that have been observed in vitro and the known downstream signaling of CSF1R, syndecan-1, and PTP-ζ in murine models, the in vivo activities of this cytokine should be explored further to identify potential new treatments for neuropathologies associated with neuronal injury. | GrowthDifferentiation Factor-15 7.1. Overview of Structure and Function Growthdifferentiation factor (GDF)-15, also known as macrophage inhibitory cytokine (MIC)-1, is a 30 kDa disulfide-linked homodimer belonging to the TGF-β superfamily of proteins . | In the CNS, its modulation of appetite and food intake has made GDF-15 a molecule of interest in weight loss research , and its neurotrophic effects remain relatively unexplored in comparison. | In the peripheral nervous system, GDF-15 is thought to be a neurotrophic factor since both GDF-15 mRNA and protein are upregulated following dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nerve lesions in mice . | The effects of GDF-15 on food intake and obesity are being extensively researched, but its potential neurotrophic effects remain largely unexplored. | In this experiment, GDF-15 activates Akt and suppresses ERK leading to reduced c-Jun phosphorylation, inhibition of ROS generation, and promotion of neuronal survival . | In an in vitro mouse model of PD GDF-15 exerts a neuroprotective effect, rescuing primary cultures of ventral midbrain neurons from GDF-15 knockout mice following treatment with 6OHDA . | Another study using GDF-15 knockout mice finds that these animals display progressive postnatal losses of motoneurons highlighting the neurotrophic effect of this protein during neurodevelopment . | Overall, there is sufficient evidence identifying GDF-15 as a cytokine that should be studied further as a neurotrophic factor with potentially beneficial effects in human neurodegenerative diseases. | FGF-2 exerts neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects on cultured murine CGNs by reducing spontaneous as well as alcohol-induced death of these cells. | This indicates that MAPKs may mediate the neuroprotective and growth-promoting effects of FGF-2 . | 8.4. Neurotrophic Effects Culturing neurons in serum-free, low insulin medium minimizes confounding factors when assessing the neurotrophic effects of proteins. | This demonstrates the neuroprotective effects of FGF-2 on neurons damaged by axonal transection . | It can be concluded that the available evidence from both murine and human models indicates that FGF-2 can be released by microglia to act as a neurotrophic molecule supporting the growth, survival, and differentiation of neurons in the CNS. | IGF-2 has similar effects on CNS cells and acts as a neuroprotective agent by promoting the survival of neurons . | Co-injection of IGF-2 with IGF2R-specific inhibitors eliminates memory enhancement achieved by administration of the growth factor on its own. | IGF-2 is also neuroprotective against corticosterone-induced damage in adult rat cortical neuronal cultures . | This is mediated by the activation of IGF1R, as evidenced by the use of specific IGF1R inhibitors that completely block the neurite outgrowth-promoting effects of IGF-2 . | While the neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects of IGF-2 have been documented by multiple studies, the secretion of this cytokine by microglia has not been established conclusively; therefore, it is imperative to study the regulation of its expression in surveying and reactive microglia in different species before IGF-2 can be regarded as a microglia-derived neurotrophic factor. | Conclusions Even though microglia, alongside astrocytes, are a known source of neurotrophic factors, the majority of review articles detailing this aspect of microglial contributions to CNS homeostasis highlight several proteins with already established neurotrophic activities including BDNF, GDNF, NGF, NT-3, and NT-45. | In this review article, we chose to focus on eight different molecules that so far have not been viewed as canonical microglia-derived neurotrophic factors, but yet have sufficient evidence supporting their expression andor secretion by microglia as well as indications of their trophic and protective effects on neurons (Figure 1, Table 2). | We also conclude that the demonstrated neurotrophic effects for each of the eight cytokines are varied and include increased neuronal survival or proliferation, recovery of neurons after insult, enhanced neurite outgrowth, increased differentiation, and attenuation of neurodegeneration (Figure 1, Table 2). | All of the considered cytokines are shown to increase neuronal survival in one or more neuronal cell models. | However, after this initial similarity, the neurotrophic effects of individual cytokines begin to diversify. | Currently, it is not clear whether such partially overlapping neurotrophic activities are true characteristics of the reviewed cytokines or an illustration of the fragmented nature of our current knowledge related to these molecules as neurotrophic factors. | Comprehensive studies using each of the cytokines and covering the full spectrum of neurotrophic effects are needed to answer this question. | We feel such further research is warranted due to the already available preclinical studies using in vitro and in vivo systems which demonstrate neurotrophic effects of these cytokines in models of ischemic stroke, hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, ICH, TBI, axotomy, hypokalemia, iron intoxication, immunodeficiency, steroid toxicity, inflammation, excitotoxic injury, SCI, and a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, including AD, MS, PD, and HD (Table 2). | Only more comprehensive future research could establish which of these disorders could benefit from interventions using or targeting the signaling pathways triggered by each of the microglia-derived cytokines potentially possessing neurotrophic properties.","GD (MISC), BD (MISC), CS (ORG), IL (MISC), Micro (MISC), C (MISC)"

11644011.xml,Sirtuin Proteins and Memory: A Promising Target in Alzheimer’s Disease Therapy?,"We have also reviewed the use of selective andor natural SIRT activators as potential therapeutic agents andor adjuvants for AD. | For instance, SIRT inhibitors have been considered in the treatment of several types of cancer , while SIRT activators have been suggested as therapeutic targets for age-related disorders such as Alzheimers disease (AD) . | For the last decade, natural medicines andor supplements have attracted interest, and several phytochemical compounds have been shown to reduce AD hallmarks (such as amyloid accumulation, neuroinflammation and oxidation). | Interestingly, some of these natural compounds have been reported to act on SIRTs, which for some of the subtypes have been reported at lower levels in AD patients . | Finally, we have reviewed the recent research advances in the use of selective andor natural SIRT activators as potential therapeutic agents andor adjuvants for AD. | For example, in humanmouse brain cells, SIRT1 has a neuroprotective action via actions on p53 and FOXO (forkhead transcriptional factors FOXO) across several pathways involved in apoptosis . | SIRT1 can also indirectly inhibit NF-κB signaling by its stimulative interaction with AMPK, which is an inhibitor of NF-κB . | In the CNS, deacetylation of nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 2 (NMNAT2) has been found to have several neuroprotective properties including its actions on heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) interaction, which result in a refolding of aggregated protein substrates . | SIRT1 is involved in the regulation of APP processing and the clearance of Aβ and its activation provides neuroprotection .SIRT1 modulates tau phosphorylation by deacetylating tau protein and influencing the activity of kinases and phosphatases, such as PP2A activation leading to a decrease in tau phosphorylation .SIRT1 regulates neuroinflammation via NF-κB , highly expressed in AD.SIRT1 promotes mitochondrial biogenesis via activation of mitochondrial PGC-1α gene expression , which may lead to a reduction in oxidative stress reported in AD. | SIRT3 activation promotes the increase in neuronal survival and decrease apoptotic gene expression, reduces oxidative stress, regulates mitochondrial homeostasis (including increased bioenergetics), decreases neuroinflammation present in AD SIRT4 Mitochondrial Brain, heart, kidney, liver, blood vessels, pancreatic β-cells Deacetylase, ADP-ribosyltransferase, Lipoamidase, Deacylase DNA repair, cell survival,Neurodegeneration,Cardio-vascular protection,Oxidation, Metabolism. | Furthermore, modulation of the acetylome and activation of several metabolic enzymes (e.g., MnSOD) protects function and redox homeostasis in the mitochondria, which impacts the neuronal survival and synaptic signaling mediating for both short- and long-term memory formation, as well as memory retention, in the hippocampus (Figure 1) . | However, several clinical trials were terminated due to the lack of specificity of these synthetic SIRT1 activators and their failure to achieve the desired therapeutic effects . | The cytotoxicity and multi-target effects of activators of SIRT1 have prompted the need for researchers to explore more effective alternatives for activating SIRT1 pathways . | Recently, SRT2104 has emerged as one of the most specific small molecule activators of SIRT1, and was well tolerated in a pilot randomized placebo-controlled double-blind phase I trial (NCT00964340) involving a healthy elderly population . | With the lack of studies andor results for synthetic activators of SIRT in the context of AD, the exploration of natural compounds able to modulate the levels of SIRTs is warranted. | 4.1. Main Natural Coumpounds Modulating SIRTs in AD Over the last decade, the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions of bioactive compounds have attracted much attention from pharmaceutical companies. | Several studies have shown that polyphenols, flavonoids, and polysaccharides are compounds that can modulate SIRT pathways , offering new avenues for therapy, particularly in the context of AD. | One of these bioactive compounds tested in AD is resveratrol. | These processes may contribute to the neuroprotective (by reducing neuroinflammation and neuronal oxidative stress) and anti-amyloidogenic effects of resveratrol reported in vitro and in vivo, particularly in animal models of AD . | In fact, careful review of the meta-analysis that examined the effects of resveratrol in both human and animal AD cases revealed significant evidence that this compound may be used as a therapeutic andor protective agent for AD . | Although the mechanism via which resveratrol was able to reduce Aβ plaques in the brain remains unclear, this compound may regulate APP processing towards the non-amyloidogenic pathways, leading to reduced production of Aβ peptides (Figure 1 and Figure 2). | This may be due to variations in study design, participant inclusion criteria, dosage and treatment durations, and overlooking other potentially confounding factors (e.g., medications, co-existing medical conditions, or genetic variations for compound metabolism). | Variations in the bioavailability of natural bioactive molecules may also affect the efficiency and therapeutic effects of tested compounds in humans. | For example, pharmacokinetic studies of resveratrol showed that this compound was rapidly metabolized and highly absorbed in humans; however, only 2 of free resveratrol was detected in participants blood . | By encapsulating resveratrol in polymer nanoparticles with a controlled size (1100 nm), the efficiency of this compound was significantly increased . | The natural bioactive compound, curcumin, has shown effectiveness in AD treatment in human randomized trials due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects . | Seaweeds contain many bioactive compounds, including polyphenols, polysaccharides, fucosterol, and fucoxantin, and have been implicated in possessing several biological activities, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects . | Aside from brown seaweed compounds, ulvan is a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from green seaweed species . | Some compounds isolated from seaweeds can pass through the bloodbrain barrier and have been found to have several neuroprotective effects . | Despite a renewed interest in alternative medicine to help treat AD through its modulation of SIRTs, there are currently no clinical studies demonstrating the efficiency of tested natural compounds in AD therapy. | Improving the bioavailability of natural compounds in humans remains a priority in the development of natural medicine. | 4.2. Non-Pharmacological Modulation of SIRTs: Exercise There is emerging evidence highlighting the neuroprotective effects of regular exercise in both animal and human studies, with improvements in the level of oxidative stress and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, which is critical for synaptic plasticity and cognitive performance . | In an animal model of AD, treadmill exercise inhibited Aβ production in the cortex of an NSEAPPsw-transgenic mouse via an increase in SIRT1 levels and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) levels. | A combined approach including a low natural compound supplementation and exercise program may maximise the clinical benefit of SIRT modulation. | Furthermore, individual inter-variability reported in clinical trials may also reflect the need to consider genetic make-up involved in tested compound metabolism (such as resveratrol andor genetic variations within SIRTs genes ). | By taking into account the genetic profiling, the compound doses andor type of intervention may be further considered and tailored to the individual to maximise the therapeutic effects of SIRT modulation. | For example, the cholinergic esterase inhibitor, Donepezil, can cause extrapyramidal symptoms, bradycardia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and vomiting, while rivastigmine increases the risk of all-cause mortality, especially among patients who are critically ill . | Although nanotechnology approaches have improved dramatically in the last decade to enhance the durability, solubility, and transport of the bioactive compounds to the brain, the utilization of this technique is still in its infancy and requires more work for its application in human participants. | In conclusion, the quest for improving efficacy and delivery of natural compounds in AD context must continue considering the growth in prevalence of this disease worldwide.","Sir (MISC), S (MISC), S (MISC), S (MISC), Alzheimers (MISC), AD (MISC), S (MISC), AD (MISC), S (MISC), AD (MISC), Sirtuin (MISC), S (MISC), Sa (MISC), ##cc (ORG), ##omy (MISC), ##ces (ORG), ##visiae (ORG), S (MISC), N (MISC), HDAC (MISC), S (MISC)"

which have demonstrated neuroprotective activity . | In addition, several compounds that belong to hydroxycoumarins (fraxidin, isofraxidin, 7-hydroxy-6-methoxycoumarin, and 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin) and to quinic acids and derivatives (quinic acid, chlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid, methyl chlorogenate, 5-O-feruloylquinic acid, 3-O-feruloylquinic acid, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, 1,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, and 3-O-p-coumaroylquinic acid) subclasses were also identified, many of them with reported antioxidant activity . | persica, showing sesquiterpene coumarins and sulfur compounds as the main components . | For instance, 61 components (phenylpropanoids, oxygenated monoterpenes, monoterpene hydrocarbons, sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes, and essential oil) were identified in the aerial parts , while 39 compounds (sulfur compounds, oxygenated monoterpenes, and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons) were identified in the roots. | The abundancy of these compounds widely varied under the different extraction conditions, and the area under the curve of each extraction condition as well as the results of the different statistical analyses are presented in Table S2. | The PCA established two principal components (PC1PC2) when using the abundancy of the individual compounds, explaining 31.6 (PC1) and 20.5 (PC2) of the variance (Figure 1A). | Moreover, the dendrogram analysis performed using the total abundancy of the different subclasses of compounds provided similar but not exactly the same results (Figure 1C). | As expected, these results indicated that the different solvents applied to the two matrices affected both the individual compounds and the chemical subclasses to which they belong. | Furthermore, the PLS-DA analysis provided 34 compounds with VIP scores 1.5 (Figure 1D), which were responsible for the separation observed between the different extracts (Figure 1E). | Most of these compounds, except syringaresinol glucoside, had higher abundancy in the aerial part extracts, and more specifically in the CPME and EtAc extracts. | Other compounds, such as glycoside derivatives (from flavonoids and lignans), had higher abundancy in the EtOH and H2O aerial part extracts. | Additionally, three interesting compounds that could be pinpointed from this analysis were those with maximum abundancy in the extracts obtained under optimum conditions, such as luteolin and kaempferol (in the aerial part extract) and 3-hydroxymyristic acid (in the root extract). | These results demonstrated the different distribution of compounds, such flavonoids, in the different fractions of F. | persica, but they also highlighted this subclass of compounds, in their free and glycosylated forms, as contributors to the in vitro neuroprotective capacity observed in the extracts obtained under optimum conditions. | For the ChemRICH analysis, the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) and the subclass of each tentatively identified compound were used, as well as the fold change (FC) and p-value for each pairwise comparison (Opt-CPME, Opt-EtAc, Opt-EtOH, and Opt-H2O) (these values are presented in Table S2). | In the case of the aerial part samples, the optimum conditions highly increased the extraction efficiency of methoxyphenols and monoterpenoids (except with respect to CPME) and other subclasses to a lesser extent (such as amino acids, benzoic acids, carbonyl compounds, flavones, or O-methylated flavonoids). | In the case of the monoterpenoid subclass, five of the identified compounds were acetate derivatives (4-terpinyl acetate, bornyl acetate, fenchyl acetate, lavandulyl acetate, and α-terpinyl acetate), and α-terpinyl acetate and bornyl acetate have demonstrated good neuroprotective potential . | These last results may have been a consequence of: (i) the use of non-polar solvents (EtAc and CPME), as those compounds are mainly water soluble; and (ii) the use high temperature (180 C), as this parameter has previously been demonstrated to increase the degradation of glycosides when using PLE technology . | In the case of the root samples, the optimum conditions increased the extraction of many subclasses of compounds, such as alcohols and polyols, amino acids, benzoic acids, carbonyl compounds, or methoxyphenols. | In this regard, a number of monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids have demonstrated interesting neuroprotective properties , such as nerolidol, caryophyllene oxide, α-humulene, or α-bisabolol . | Thereafter, the abundancy of the individual compounds was compared among different extracts of the same matrix using ANOVA, revealing that most of them were affected by the extraction conditions (Table S2). | Among these compounds, cinnamic acid derivatives (such as 2,5-dihydroxycinnamic acid) possess the ability to inhibit cholinesterase , and β-carbolines (such as harman and norharman) have been described as having good antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects . | Other compounds, such as chrysoeriol, can confer neuroprotection , and 3,4-dihydroxyacetophenone, which can cross the bloodbrain barrier, was shown to be positively correlated with the neuroprotective potential of thinned peaches extracts . | Some of these compounds could have been obtained during the extraction process due to the high extraction temperature used (180 C), which has been shown to help extract phenolic acids , releasing free flavonoids from more complex molecules or forming other bioactive compounds, such as melanoidins . | Furthermore, to identity those compounds that could be responsible of the in vitro neuroprotective activity observed, a Pearsons correlation test between the abundancy of the compounds and ROS and AChE activities was performed (Table S2). | In the case of the aerial part samples, this analysis revealed that 50 compounds were significantly correlated with ROS scavenging capacity, while 16 were correlated with AChE inhibitory activity (r 0.8 and p-value 0.1). | Among them, 12 compounds (acetylleucine, 4-methyl-5-thiazoleethanol, β-asarone, N-(2-phenylethyl)acetamide, farnesyl acetate, thymidine, cis,cis-linoleic acid, isofraxidin, kaempferol, α-hydroxybutyric acid, nobiletin, and γ-sitosterol) were correlated with both activities (Table 5). | In the case of the root samples, and following the same criteria, 38 and 81 compounds were significantly correlated with ROS and AChE activities, respectively. | Among them, 8 compounds (guaiol acetate, selina-3,7(11)-diene, 2-hydroxypalmitic acid, kaempferol, stearic acid, palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, and α-cyperone) were correlated with both activities (Table 5). | Some of these compounds, such as isofraxidin β-asarone , nobiletin , α-cyperone , and kaempferol , have already demonstrated interesting neuroprotective properties. | 3.5. Molecular Docking Simulations Based on these promising results, molecular docking simulations were performed to evaluate the binding affinities of different complexes between the 19 compounds significantly correlated with ROS and AChE activities and the target enzymes AChE, BChE, and LOX (Table 5). | Galantamine and quercetin were used as standard inhibitors. | Many of these interactions have already been described for compounds targeting acetylcholinesterase . | However, it must be mentioned that the area under the curve of kaempferol was relatively low (Table S2), which made us discard this molecule as the main molecule responsible of the inhibitory activity observed in vitro. | The docking results (Figure S3) showed that most of these compounds had multiple πalkyl interactions with the same residues: for selina-3,7(11)-diene, with the amino acids LEU565, LEU773, ALA561, HIS523, ILE572, HIS518, VAL769, ILE770, PHE576, and TRP519; for guaiol acetate, with the amino acids LEU565, LEU773, ALA561, HIS523, ILE572, HIS518, HIS513, VAL566, and ILE557 (together with πσ interactions with TRP519); and for α-cyperone, with the amino acids LEU565, LEU773, ILE572, HIS518, VAL769, PHE576, and LEU 515. | Many of these interactions have already been described for other natural compounds, such as coumarin derivatives and flavonoids . | Overall, the molecular docking results suggested sesquiterpenes, especially selina-3,7(11)-diene, guaiol acetate, α-cyperone, and farnesyl acetate, as compounds with promising neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory capacity. | Conclusions In the present work, a green extraction method based on PLE was optimized to obtain bioactive compounds from F. | aerial parts and roots, together with an in vitro neuroprotective evaluation and a comprehensive chemical characterization. | Furthermore, the extensive chemical characterization highlighted the complex and diverse composition of all of the extracts, indicating that non-polar solvents increased the extraction of specific subclasses of compounds, such as hydroxycoumarins, flavones, methoxyphenols, monoterpenoids, O-methylated flavonoids, and sesquiterpenoids, independently of the plant material used. | Among them, several flavonoids and sesquiterpenoids have already been reported as good antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective molecules (as those identified in the present work), which combined could explain the in vitro neuroprotective activity observed. | Nonetheless, this high complexity also makes the absolute quantification of all molecules difficult and hampers the undoubted determination of the responsible compounds, as synergistic effects might occur. | To solve these limitations, future work will be directed to absolutely quantifying the most promising compounds in these extracts, to evaluating their neuroprotective capacity in cell culture models, to investigating their potential to cross the bloodbrain barrier, and to performing advanced molecular dynamics simulations if promising results are obtained.","Fe (PER), Fe (PER), ##si (MISC), Alzheimers (MISC), AD (MISC), F (ORG), ##si (MISC), L (ORG)"

tumorigenesis and other diseases (neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory disorders, and developmental diseases), making them promising therapeutic targets Our review also discusses the challenges in developing DUB inhibitors and underscores the critical role of the DUBs in cellular signaling and cancer. | As research has progressed, the critical role of the DUBs in oncology has also gained significant attention, leading to the gradual development of small molecule modulators targeting DUB proteins. | This comprehensive review aims to provide valuable insights into the development of selective DUB inhibitors and their potential clinical applications in targeted therapy and immunomodulation, thereby contributing to future research directions in this field. | For example, USP30 is ubiquitinated by Parkin that promotes the its degradation through the proteasome pathway, thereby enhancing mitophagy by removing the inhibitory effect of USP30 on this process. | Early studies have shown that some DUBs form inhibitory complexes with other proteins, thereby reducing their activity. | For example, the inhibitory complex formed by OTUB1 with charged E2Ub thioesters and free ubiquitin can inhibit OTUB1s DUB activity. | The inhibitory effect of these interactions provides a potential pathway for developing new DUB inhibitors. | 2.3.3 Allosteric

development of DUB inhibitors or modulators holds promise for more effective cancer treatments. | 3.5 Hippo signaling pathway The Hippo signaling pathway is a critical regulator of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and organ size, with its core components, including the MST12 kinases, LATS12 kinases, and the transcription coactivators YAPTAZ. | The function of DUBs in cancer is complex, as they can promote tumor development in certain contexts while exhibiting inhibitory effects in others. | 325 The OTU family members, particularly OTUD7B and OTUD7A, exhibit inhibitory effects on HCC. |

autophagyinducing effects do not depend on its catalytic activity, highlighting its unique role in regulating neuronal proteostasis. | 369 USP14 inhibitor have been developed as a potential therapeutic agent to protect cells from neurodegenerative stressors cell by enhancing proteasome activity and promoting the degradation of proteotoxic proteins. | 370 , 371 Furthermore, a broader role of USP14 in memory formation and neuroprotection against ischemic injury, highlighting it as a promising therapeutic target in neurodegenerative disorders. | 372 , 373 A recent study reports that loss of USP30 enhances mitophagy and reduces neurodegeneration by counteracting αsynucleins effects, and a USP30 inhibitor MTX115325 shows potential as a diseasemodifying therapy for PD. | 376 , 377 , 378 These results suggest that targeting mutated ATXN3 could offer a promising therapeutic strategy for SCA3, highlighting the need to develop effective ATXN3 inhibitors. | Beyond αsynuclein regulation, UCHL1 interacts with and stabilizes TrkB, a neurotrophin receptor critical for neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity, highlighting a mechanism where UCHL1 modulates BDNFTrkB signaling by preventing TrkB degradation. | 382 These findings underscore the multifaceted role of UCHL1 in neuroprotection and its potential as a therapeutic target in neurodegenerative disorders. | However, developing effective inhibitors for DUBs present multiple challenges, including their high homology, complex threedimensional structures, dynamic conformational changes, and regulation by posttranslational modifications and protein interactions. | Despite these challenges, researchers have successfully identified potential inhibitors targeting specific DUBs through computeraided design and virtual screening techniques (Table 2). | TABLE 2 DUB smallmolecule inhibitors. | 6.1 Targeting USPs As research on the critical roles of the USP family in diseases increases, the discovery of small molecule drugs targeting the USP family has also been burgeoning. | Existing studies have provided detailed reviews of the various small molecule inhibitors currently targeting the USP family. | 24 , 464 , 465 To provide the latest updates, this section will summarize some of the newly emerged USP inhibitors in the past 3 years, focusing on their development strategies and pharmacological activities (Table 2). | The development strategy for USP1 inhibitors involved designing and synthesizing a series of pyridopyrimidin7(8H)one derivatives based on the structure of known inhibitors, with systematic exploration of their structureactivity relationships. | Compound 1m showed strong antiproliferative effects, arrested cancer cells in the S phase, acted as reversible and noncompetitive inhibitors, and enhanced the efficacy of the PARP inhibitor olaparib, demonstrating excellent oral pharmacokinetic properties in mice. | 429 ML323 is a USP1 inhibitor that shows specifically antagonizing the USP1UAF1 complex without affecting other DUBs. Recently, ML323 effectively suppressed the proliferation of HCC and ESCC cells, inhibited TGFβ induced EMT in TNBC cells, and induced apoptosis and DNA damage in ESCC cells, demonstrating its potential as a viable anticancer treatment. | 430 Through a scaffold hopping strategy to enhance the cellular activity of FT671 (known USP7 inhibitor), resulting in the discovery of YCH2823 as a novel and potent USP7 inhibitors. | YCH2823 demonstrated potent inhibition of USP7, inhibiting cancer cell growth, promoting G1 phase arrest and apoptosis, increasing p53 and p21 levels, and showing synergistic effects with mTOR inhibitors, making it a promising anticancer agent for both TP53 wildtype and mutant tumors. | 432 Recently, a series of pyrrolepyrimidin4one derivatives were designed for USP7 inhibition, with the representative compound Z33 (YCH3124) showing high potency and selectivity. | 433 Moreover, a series of 2aminopyridine derivatives were designed and synthesized based on structural modifications of the lead USP7 inhibitor, GNE6640. | 434 Furthermore, the proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) strategy was employed to discovery small molecule to degrade USP7 for inhibiting its function. | Among the synthesized compounds, PROTAC 17 exhibited the most potent USP7 inhibition with an IC50 value of 1.7 µM, aligning with docking results and cell viability profiles, indicating its potential efficacy. | 435 A novel compound D1 with quinolin4(1H)one scaffold was identified as a lead USP10 inhibitor due to its high potency and selectivity. | 436 Spautin1 has been reported as an inhibitor of USP10 and USP13, significantly reducing the proliferation and migration of glioblastoma cells. | 438 Though highthroughput screening and structurebased optimization, BAY805 was developed as a highly potent and selective noncovalent USP21 inhibitor. | 439 Utilizing predictive models to screen and identify potential compounds from the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA)approved drug library, nifuroxazide was identified as the most potent USP21 inhibitor with an IC50 of 14.9 µM. | 441 Recently, identifying a traditional Chinese secoiridoid compound, gentiopicroside, was identified as a USP22 inhibitor by stably binding to the USP22 catalytic pocket. | 442 USP25 and USP28, which are highly homologous and associated with diseases like cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, have recently become focal points for the development of therapeutic inhibitors. | 466 , 467 Through screening a synthetic compound library and further structure optimization, CT1113 was synthesized and developed as a promising USP inhibitor with potent activity against USP28 and USP25. | 444 Given the similar conserved catalytic domain structures in the USP family, different USP targeted inhibitors can also serve as a starting point for ligand design. | The study of the biochemical and structural characteristics of USP47 reveals why the USP7 inhibitor derivative P50429 has targeting and inhibitory abilities toward USP47, and provides new insights for further design of USP47 specific inhibitors. | 445 To develop USP48 inhibitors, 14 commercially available USP inhibitors were screened and ML364 (known as a USP2 inhibitor) was identified as a candidate for further optimization. | Using a ligandbased approach, a series of ML364 analogs were synthesized, with compound 17e showing an IC50 of 12.6 µM in inhibiting USP48 activity. | Further structural refinements are necessary to enhance the inhibition activity and specificity of these compounds. | 446 6.2 Targeting OTUs Recent advancements in OTU deubiquitinase inhibitors have opened new avenues for targeted cancer therapy by modulating deubiquitination processes to suppress tumor growth. | Studies have reported that various smallmolecule compounds, such as SJB3019A, OTUB2IN1, and OTUDin3, exhibit significant inhibitory effects on deubiquitinases along with notable antitumor activities. | This section primarily explores the screening processes, structural optimization, and application potential of several representative OTU deubiquitinase inhibitors across different tumor models, underscoring the importance of further studies to enhance drug selectivity and safety. | Screening was conducted on 20 reported databases of DUB or DUBlike protease inhibitors, and two USP1like inhibitors, SJB2043 and SJB3019A, were found to exhibit significant inhibitory effects on OTUB1 and USP8 at a concentration of 2.5 µM. | To further explore the potential of these inhibitors, indepth structureactivity relationship studies were conducted. | Four analogues, compounds 60, 61, 62, and 63, were developed by modifying the 2phenyl ring of SJB2043 with single substitution, double substitution, and phenyl ring modification. | Subsequently, protein thermal stability and enzyme activity experiments of compound 61 on OTUB1, as well as molecular docking mechanism analysis, showed that compound 61 has high selectivity and strong inhibitory effects on OTUB1 and USP8. | This compound not only demonstrated strong inhibitory effects on OTUB1 and USP8 in vitro but also showed significant antiproliferative effects in H1975 and A549 NSCLC cell lines. | Additionally, compound 61 effectively inhibited tumor growth in the H1975 xenograft mouse model after lowdose intraperitoneal administration. | However, despite the significant antitumor activity exhibited by compound 61, studies also found that the OTUB1USP8 protein exhibits instability when bound to compound 61. | This discovery suggests that further validation of the binding mode of inhibitors is needed in the future, and their efficacy and safety should be evaluated in other animal models. | In particular, indepth studies of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacological properties of compound 61, as well as its mechanisms of action in different tumor types, will help optimize its structure, improving its stability and selectivity. | 447 As the first effective OTUB2 inhibitor, OTUB2IN1 forms hydrogen bonds between its two carboxyl groups and four amino acid residues (Thr45, Gly49, Ser223, and His224) in the OTUB2 catalytic pocket, significantly inhibiting the hydrolysis activity of the recombinant GSTOTUB2 protein toward substrate UbR110. | 448 In the study of OTUD3, computeraided virtual screening and biological experiments identified two OTUD3 inhibitors, OTUDin3 and Rolapitant, which inhibit the deubiquitinase activity of OTUD3. | These research findings further confirm the effectiveness of strategies to influence tumor growth and cell death by regulating specific DUBs. 449 , 450 Additionally, effective inhibitors 7Ai and 7Bi targeting OTUD7A and OTUD7B were discovered using AtomNet virtual screening technology. | Using the generated structures, 4 million compounds were screened, and based on their ability to reduce the abundance of EWSFLI1 protein in A673 and SKNMC cells, it was found that 7Ai can effectively block OTUD7Amediated deubiquitination of EWSFLI1 without affecting the binding of OTUD7A to EWSFLI1. | Similarly, 10 candidate compounds for OTUD7B inhibitors were screened through AtomNet technology and biological experiments. | Subsequently, the inhibitory effects of these compounds on Akt pS473 signaling in various NSCLC cell lines were investigated, and OTUD7B deubiquitinase activity was measured in vitro using K11linked dimeric ubiquitin (diub) as a substrate. | Finally, the study found that compound 7Bi specifically inhibits OTUD7B and inhibits the growth of various NSCLC cells, including A549, in vitro. | The discovery of 7Ai and 7Bi inhibitors indicates that AtomNet has significant potential in discovering different inhibitors of closely related deubiquitinase members. | 451 , 452 Although there is limited research on the role of TRABID in tumors, computer screening of crystal structures based on the A20 OTU domain, searching for compounds that may bind to TRABID catalytic sites, combined with preliminary biological experiments, identified NSC112200 and NSC267309 as TRABID inhibitors with IC50 values of approximately 3 µM. | At a concentration of 20 µM, these two compounds not only inhibited the growth of colorectal tumor cell lines HCT116 and SW480 but also inhibited the growth of two abnormal cell lines, NIH3T3 and HEK293. | 454 conducted a more indepth study on the mechanism of action of the inhibitor NSC112200. | However, the inhibitor exhibits certain toxicity in mice, so its structure needs further optimization. | 454 These studies indicate that NSC112200 and NSC267309 have significant antitumor potential as TRABID inhibitors. | Further optimizing the structure of these inhibitors not only helps to improve their selectivity and safety but also provides important theoretical and experimental bases for the development of newgeneration TRABID inhibitors. | To accelerate the discovery of OTU family inhibitors, an efficient screening platform was established by designing a chemical library based on the chemical types of various DUB inhibitors and combining it with activitybased protein mass spectrometry analysis. | Through this platform, the inhibitor of VCPIP1, the fluoroquinolone compound CAS12290201, was successfully screened. | This compound exhibits high selectivity and strong inhibitory effect on VCPIP1, with an enzymatic IC50 value of 70 nM. | This study demonstrates the feasibility of developing DUB inhibitors through structureguided methods. | Specifically, the successful application of this virtual platform demonstrates that activitybased protein mass spectrometry analysis and welldesigned chemical libraries can effectively screen and optimize DUB inhibitors. | This method not only improves screening efficiency but also significantly enhances the specificity and efficacy of inhibitors, providing important references and tools for future drugdevelopment. | 455 In addition to developing inhibitors that directly interact with catalytic site domains, a novel strategy for creating heterobifunctional chimeric molecules targeting DUBs has recently been proposed, known as DUBTAC technology. | For instance, a recently developed covalent small molecule ligand for OTUB1, acrylamide EN523, can specifically target the noncatalytic allosteric Cys C23 on OTUB1 and effectively bind to OTUB1 within cells. | 6.3 Targeting other DUBs Significant advancements in the development of DUB inhibitors have expanded the scope beyond the wellstudied USP and OTU families, leading to the discovery of potent and selective inhibitors targeting other DUB family members. | This section highlights key compounds such as GK13S, a selective inhibitor of UCHL1, VLX1570 targeting USP14 and UCHL5, and the Rpn11 inhibitor capzimin. | These inhibitors showcase high potency and specificity, serving as essential tools for biochemical research and potential therapeutic applications. | One notable example is the UCHL1targeted inhibitor GK13S. | This inhibitor covalently attaches to the C90 residue via its cyanamide warhead and occupies the enzymes catalytic cleft. | 456 Furthermore, VLX1570, a dual inhibitor of USP14 and UCHL5, was developed from bAP15. | Although VLX1570 is the first DUB inhibitor to enter clinical trials, the study was terminated due to doselimiting toxicities observed at higher doses. | 460 Another significant discovery is iBAP, a selective inhibitor of BAP1, with an IC50 value of 253 nM. | This inhibitor exhibits high specificity for BAP1 over other DUBs. Research shows that leukemia cells harboring truncated ASXL1 gainoffunction mutations, such as K562 cells and THP1 cells, are particularly sensitive to iBAP treatment. | Utilizing a specialized highthroughput screening platform, CSN5i3 emerged as a highly potent inhibitor. | In tests on 500 diverse cancer cell lines, CSN5i3 showed a range of inhibitory activities and significantly suppressed the growth of human xenografts in mouse models. | 463 Recent progress in developing inhibitors for various DUBs beyond the USP and OTU families underscores significant advancements in this field. | These inhibitors not only enhance our understanding of DUBrelated cellular mechanisms but also offer promising prospects for treating cancers and other diseases associated with dysregulated ubiquitination pathways. | Continued research in this area is likely to yield even more potent and specific inhibitors with broad therapeutic potential. | Although significant progress has been achieved in developing inhibitors for the entire DUB family, substantial challenges persist in this area of research. | A major obstacle is the identification of potent compounds that selectively target the catalytic pocket of DUBs. Furthermore, the dynamic alternation between active and inactive conformations of DUBs complicates the design of predictive biochemical assays and the development of druglike compounds. | Additionally, the ubiquitin transfer mediated by reactive thiols in DUBs presents difficulties in the screening of inhibitors. | These challenges have limited the advancement of DUB inhibitors, with only a few making preliminary progress in clinical trials for cancer treatment. | Mitoxantrone, approved by the US FDA as a USP11 inhibitor, is undergoing numerous phase III trials targeting conditions including neoplasms, acute myeloid leukemia, MS, and breast cancer. | To advance DUB inhibitors toward clinical application, future research should pivot toward gaining deeper biological insights. | While traditional methods involve screening known libraries and identifying hit compounds, a shift is needed toward confirming target engagement in cellular and in vivo models through biomarker studies, gene knockout phenotypes, and competitive binding assays. | Chemical proteomics is indispensable in uncovering novel DUB functions and substrate interactions, capitalizing on the unique adaptability, dose responsiveness, and selectivity of small molecules. | By identifying the specific pathogenesis associated with different DUBs, researchers can design small molecule inhibitors or activators tailored to precisely modulate deubiquitination activities. | Additionally, developing selective inhibitors or activators that target specific DUB members could offer more precise and effective cancer therapies. | The development of small molecule inhibitors targeting DUBs faces significant challenges due to the highly conserved catalytic domains of each subfamily and complex regulatory mechanisms. | These factors make achieving specificity and selectivity in inhibitors particularly difficult. | Despite the identification of several inhibitors for OTUs like OTUB1, OTUB2, OTUD7B, and TRABID, challenges related to activity, selectivity, pharmacokinetics, and safety persist, leading to suboptimal drug performance. | These tools facilitate virtual screening and optimization of candidate drugs and enable precise prediction of protein structures, aiding in the design of small molecules that accurately target DUBs. Additionally, the therapeutic potential of DUB activators should not be overlooked. | Some DUBs exhibit tumor suppressive functions, and developing small molecule activators that enhance the catalytic activity or stability of these tumor suppressive DUBs may provide a novel approach for cancer treatment. | Designing PROTACs for selective degradation of OTUs offers the possibility of achieving more effective and sustained inhibition of their carcinogenic activity, potentially overcoming compensatory mechanisms commonly found in traditional inhibitors. | For example, the covalent small molecule ligand acrylamide EN523 of OTUB1 is the first developed DUBTAC and holds significant promise. | 468 By covalently binding small molecule ligands, it does not affect the deubiquitination activity of OTUB1, demonstrating the potential role and application prospects of DUBTAC technology in the future development of OTUtargeted drugs. | In conclusion, while the development of small molecules targeting DUBs presents several challenges, the integration of AI technologies and novel approaches like PROTACs and DUBTACs provide promising strategies. | Additionally, we explore the dual role of DUBs members in tumorigenesis, functioning as both tumor inhibitors and oncogenes in different types of cancer. | Importantly, we summarize current and emerging treatment strategies targeting the DUBs, including small molecule inhibitors, PROTACs, DUBTACs, and potential combination therapies.","D (MISC), D (MISC), E (MISC), D (MISC), D (MISC), D (MISC), NF (ORG), PI (ORG), ##KA (ORG), ##R (ORG), MAP (ORG), D (MISC), D (MISC), D (MISC)"

11645956.xml,Calycosin Ameliorates Neuroinflammation via TLR4-Mediated Signal Following Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury in vivo and in vitro,"Our previous research highlighted the neuroprotective effects of the phytoestrogen calycosin on CIRI, although the precise mechanism remains unclear. | Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that calycosin effectively downregulates HMGB1 and TLR4 expression, decreases NF-κB and IκB phosphorylation, and reduces the secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-18.ConclusionThese findings suggest that calycosin mitigates cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury and neuroinflammation by inhibiting the HMGB1TLR4NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby providing neuroprotection. | There has been an increasing interest in natural products with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties to alleviate cerebral IR injury.1719 Phytoestrogens are nonsteroidal polyphenolic natural products found in certain medicinal plants that structurally resemble 17-β-estradiol, a primary member of the estrogen family of female sex hormones. | These compounds can bind to estrogen receptors, exerting biological effects via genomic as well as non-genomic mechanisms.20 Research has indicated that both estrogens and phytoestrogens may positively influence brain function.21 The administration of phytoestrogens or estrogen replacement therapy has been shown to enhance cognitive function, delay the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease, and provide neuroprotection.2224 Calycosin is a bioactive isoflavone phytoestrogen extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine Astragalus membranaceus.25 Owing to its molecular structure similar to estrogen, calycosin has estrogenic and anti-estrogenic effects, and recent studies have shown that it also has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties.26,27 In our previous studies, calycosin prevented ischemic brain injury in rats by inhibiting neuronal autophagy, apoptosis, and inflammatory processes.28,29 However, the therapeutic potential of calycosin and its ability to regulate HMGB1TLR4NF-κB signaling pathway activity in cerebral ischemiareperfusion injury remain unclear. | In this study, we examined the effects of therapeutic administration of calycosin against cerebral ischemiareperfusion injury in rats, and further investigated its neuroprotective mechanisms based on the HMGB1TLR4NF-κB signaling pathway. | Calycosin Reduced Cerebral Infarction Volumes in the MCAO Model Rats TTC staining was used to determine the degree of brain damage and investigate the neuroprotective effects of calycosin in MCAO model rats. | As depicted in Figure 3B, quantitative analysis revealed that the infarct volume in the MCAO model group was 29.4. Calycosin treatment significantly decreased the infarct volume, with reductions to 14, 10, and 4 in the low-dose (5 mgkg), medium-dose (10 mgkg), and high-dose (20 mgkg) groups, respectively, indicating a pronounced neuroprotective effect.Figure 3Effects of calycosin on infarct volume in rats with cerebral ischemiareperfusion injury. | Calycosin Attenuates OGDR-Induced Neuronal Injury in PC12 Cells and Primary Neurons To further assess the neuroprotective properties of calycosin against cerebral ischemiareperfusion injury, a series of in vitro experiments was conducted using PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons. | These results indicated that calycosin possesses neuroprotective properties in PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons following OGDR treatment. | To further investigate the neuroprotective mechanisms of calycosin, we used ELISA and Western blotting to assess the expression of HMGB1, TLR4, and NF-κB in PC12 cells following LPS stimulation and calycosin pretreatment. | These results suggest that calycosin may play a neuroprotective role in cerebral ischemiareperfusion injury by inhibiting the activation of the HMGB1TLR4NF-κB signaling pathway and alleviating the inflammatory response. | The interaction between HMGB1 and TLR4 promotes dissociation of the NF-κBIκB heterodimer in the cytoplasm, leading to nuclear translocation of NF-κB, thus enhancing the expression of downstream proinflammatory cytokines.55 These cytokines possess the ability to not only attract additional immune cells from the peripheral circulation system to the CNS, thereby exacerbating the progression of neuroinflammation but also prompt microglia and macrophages to actively secrete HMGB1.56 It has been reported that NF-κB plays an essential role in the acute phase of cerebral ischemia, as evidenced by its rapid increase in transcriptional activity following cerebral ischemia.57 Notably, studies involving NF-κB (p50) knockout mice or treatment with an NF-κB inhibitor have shown a reduction in ischemic damage after a permanent focal insult.58 In our study, the expression of HMGB1 and TLR4 was significantly increased in the MCAO rat brain tissue and OGDR primary neurons. | Calycosin is a natural compound with various pharmacological activities, which have been extensively investigated. | Numerous reports have confirmed its potential in the prevention and treatment of tumors, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, and other diseases.26,59 Notably, the protective effect of calycosin against ischemic stroke has received much attention, with its neuroprotective mechanisms being multifaceted. | It has been reported that calycosin can alleviate neurological deficits and brain infarction in rats following cerebral ischemiareperfusion, through its antioxidant properties.60 Guo et al demonstrated that calycosin exhibits neuroprotective effects in MCAO rats and OGDR primary neurons by upregulating TRPC6 expression and CREB phosphorylation as well as by inhibiting calpain activation.61 Additionally, a recent study by Xu et al revealed that calycosin inhibits autophagy by regulating the STAT3FOXO3a signaling pathway, thereby ameliorating cerebral ischemiareperfusion injury.62 Furthermore, Liu et al reported that calycosin exhibited a protective effect against cerebral ischemic damage by suppressing ACSL4-dependent ferroptosis.63 Our recent study also indicated that calycosin inhibits activation of the HMGB1TLR4NF-κB signaling pathway and proinflammatory depolarization in microglia subjected to OGDR.35 In this study, we further demonstrated that the neuroprotective effect of calycosin on cerebral ischemiareperfusion injury is associated with the suppression of the inflammatory response mediated by the HMGB1TLR4NF-κB signaling pathway, both in vivo and at the neuronal level. | First, although we propose that calycosin may exert neuroprotective effects by inhibiting the HMGB1TLR4NF-κB signaling pathway, evidence supporting this mechanism remains inconclusive. | Further studies employing specific inhibitors, gene knockout techniques, or siRNA interference are necessary to comprehensively elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. | Conclusion In conclusion, our findings suggest that calycosin post-conditioning can alleviate cerebral ischemiareperfusion injury and that its neuroprotective effects are exerted through the inhibition of HMGB1TLR4NF-κB pathway signaling.","C (MISC), TLR (MISC), C (MISC), HM (MISC), CIR (MISC), CIR (MISC), MCA (MISC), C (MISC), CC (MISC), Western (MISC), E (MISC), MCA (MISC), O (MISC), ##DR (MISC), IL (MISC), IL (MISC)"

polymeric protein complex composed of NLRP3, procaspase1, and ASC, has become a pivotal mediator of inflammation in various pathologies. | 7 The identification of NLRP3specific inhibitors presents a promising avenue for the clinical application and treatment of NLRP3driven inflammatory diseases. | Previous studies have identified several small molecule compounds, such as CY09, MCC950, oridonin, and its analogues, that bind to NLRP3 and alleviate NLRP3driven inflammatory diseases in a mouse model. | 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 However, their clinical pharmacological effects and safety need to be evaluated further, and the exploitation of novel NLRP3 inhibitors with superior safety and specificity for clinical applications is still important. | Bioactive compounds derived from natural products represent valuable resources with therapeutic potential, offering prospects for developing novel drugs. | 10 However, most diterpenes only possess NLRP3 inhibitory properties at high concentrations, raising concerns about offtarget effects. | To explore this possibility, the inhibitory effects of multiple classes of diterpenes on NLRP3 activation were assessed. | Our results revealed that multiple diterpenes from different classes can inhibit the NLRP3 agonistinduced IL1β secretion and that several tetracyclic diterpenes from Isodon plants showed better inhibitory potential. | Among them, Rosthornin B (Ros B) has an optimal inhibitory effect, with an IC50 value of 0.39 μM. | Further experiments revealed that Ros B is a highly potent and specific inhibitor of NLRP3, that restrains inflammasome activation by directly binding to NLRP3 and blocking the NEK7NLRP3 interaction. | This series of natural diterpenes, especially those with low IC50 values, could be regarded as lead compounds for discovering drugs aimed at targeting NLRP3 inflammasomedriven diseases. | A range of compounds, such as nigericin (Cat. | 2.16 Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) SPR with a BIAcore 3000 instrument (GE Healthcare, Sweden) was employed to test the binding affinity between some compounds and the recombinant human NLRP3 protein. | To evaluate the inhibitory effects of multiple classes of diterpenes on NLRP3 inflammasome activation, we investigated the impacts of several types of diterpenes on the release of IL1β driven by nigericin (Figure S1AH). | 17 Several tetracyclic diterpenes, including oridonin and Rosthornin B (Ros B), showed better inhibitory potential. | In contrast, Ros B did not exhibit any inhibitory effect on the AIM2 inflammasome induced by poly (A:T) (Figure S3A,B). | Thus, these observations suggest that Ros B can directly bind to NLRP3 and that its inhibitory effect is irreversible. | (B) SPR was utilized to determine the binding affinities between the specified compounds and the recombinant human NLRP3 protein. | The results revealed that Ros B (10 mgkg) significantly inhibited the production of IL1β (Figure 5A), but it had no inhibitory impact on the inflammasomeindependent cytokine TNFα (Figure 5B). | 23 , 24 Following a screening process to assess the inhibitory effects of multiple classes of diterpenes on NLRP3 inflammasome activation, we discovered that the majority of diterpenes derived from Isodon plants could inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome. | Among these, Ros B had the best inhibitory effect, with an IC50 value of 0.39 μM, and it decreased NLRP3 inflammasome activation via directly binding to NLRP3 and blocking the NEK7NLRP3 interaction. | Furthermore, the majority of diterpenes derived from Isodon, including Ros B, disrupted the NEK7NLRP3 interaction without affecting the upstream signaling events of NLRP3 activation or the NLRP3NLRP3 interaction, suggesting a common inhibitory mechanism. | Moreover, whether the binding and inhibitory activity of Ros B on NLRP3 depend on the L451 or R454 site also needs to be further tested. | Once it is determined that the L451 or R454 of NLRP3 is crucial for the binding and inhibitory activity of Ros B, exploring whether other natural or endogenous molecules can also inhibit NLRP3 through a similar mechanism will greatly advance the development of NLRP3related inhibitors. | Highthroughput docking site prediction and molecular screening will be helpful for identifying these new NLRP3related inhibitors. | Many NLRP3related inhibitors, such as oridonin and tranilast, have also been shown to inhibit LPSTLR4 signaling. | 25 , 26 Future research is essential to identify other potential targets and inhibitory mechanisms for these inhibitors, which will guide the optimization of these inhibitors to increase their specificity and diminish offtarget effects. | In the past, several natural products have been adopted as valuable lead compounds for new drug discovery. | This series of natural diterpenes, especially those with low IC50 values, may also act as lead compounds for new drug development for the treatment of NLRP3 inflammasomedriven diseases. | These natural diterpenes, particularly those with low IC50 values, could serve as promising lead compounds for the development of novel drugs targeting NLRP3 inflammasomedriven diseases. | Structural optimization of these lead compounds that inhibit NLRP3 activation involves modifying their chemical structure to increase their potency, selectivity, pharmacokinetics, and safety profiles, making them more suitable for clinical use. | In addition, exploring the potential of modified compounds derived from the backbone to improve the pharmacological effects and safety is also worth investigating.","NLRP3 (MISC), NLRP3 (MISC), NLRP3 (MISC), Isodon (ORG), NLRP3 (MISC), R (ORG), B (MISC), R (ORG), B (MISC), R (ORG), NL (MISC), NE (MISC), NLRP (MISC), R (ORG), B (MISC), NL (MISC),

11647601.xml,Characterization of meat quality, storage stability, flavor-related compounds, and their relationship in Korean Woorimatdag No. 2 chicken breast meat during cold storage,"We evaluated the quality, storage stability, and flavor-related compounds of breast meat from a novel Korean native chicken breed (Woorimatdag No. 2; WRMD2) and commercial broiler (CB) during seven days of aerobic cold storage. | Interestingly, multivariate analysis highlighted several volatile compounds, including methyl salicylate (day 1), dodecanal (day 3), naphthalene (day 5), and 2,4-decadienal (day 7) as potential biomarkers to distinguish between WRMD2 and CB on each storage day. | These results offer insights into the distinctive meat quality and flavor compounds in WRMD2 during storage, providing fundamental data that could improve the management and quality of native chicken meat. | Introduction Chicken meat is a healthy dietary option owing to its high protein content, nutritional value, bioactive compounds (e.g., creatine and dipeptide), and affordable price (Kim et al., 2020). | This breed contains high levels of taste-related and bioactive compounds; yet it has demonstrated low growth performance, thereby making it challenging to meet market demand (Barido et al., 2022). | During refrigerated storage, meat may deteriorate, which leads to decreased freshness due to the loss of nutrients and moisture, proliferation of spoilage microorganisms, lipid oxidation, and accumulation of undesirable volatile compounds (Sujiwo et al., 2018). | These studies analyzed bioactive compounds, fatty acids (Kim et al., 2020), lipid and protein oxidation, microbial changes (Sujiwo et al., 2018), nucleotide-related products (Lee et al., 2022), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (Chmiel et al., 2020). | In this study, we aimed to fill gaps in our current understanding by investigating the changes in breast meat quality, storage stability, and flavor-related compounds of WRMD2 and CB during cold storage. | Flavor-related compounds assessment Fatty acid composition Lipid extraction and derivatization were performed as described by Barido et al. | Volatile organic compounds VOCs extraction was conducted using the headspace solid-phase micro-extraction method (Jung et al., 2024). | Consumers typically prefer microbiologically safe fresh chicken meat because the growth of spoilage microorganisms, whether inside or outside the meat, can accelerate lipid rancidity, protein oxidation, and the formation of off-odor compounds, ultimately leading to undesirable organoleptic and nutritional properties (Abdel-Naeem et al., 2021). | 2-Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances Acceleration of lipid oxidation results in the deterioration of meat quality and the development of off-odor compounds. | This trend may be attributed to the fact that microbial activity is responsible for the production of VBN compounds. | Bioactive metabolites As bioactive metabolites, creatine and creatinine play an important role in energy metabolism, muscle performance enhancement, and neuroprotection (Jung et al., 2013; Kim and Jang, 2021). | Flavor-related compounds of WRMD2 and CB Fatty acid composition Fatty acids play a crucial role in determining the flavor and nutritional profile of meat. | Both IMP and GMP are flavor-potentiating compounds that enhance meat flavor intensity on their own or synergistically with monosodium glutamate, imparting umami and meaty notes (Dashdorj et al., 2015). | In the present study, nucleotides were influenced more by storage time than by genetic differences, in contrast to the findings observed for fatty acids.Table 5Nucleotide-related compounds of commercial broiler (CB) and Woorimatdag No. 2 (WRMD2) breast meat during aerobic cold storage.Table 5ItemsTreatmentStorage dayDay 1Day 3Day 5Day 7IMPCB249.79 37.66Aa199.79 27.78b188.22 23.22b140.31 24.16cWRMD2190.52 30.71Ba176.17 21.02a184.33 21.89a137.09 21.05bGMPCB5.27 0.30Aa4.17 0.43Ab2.98 0.47c2.58 0.18cWRMD23.83 0.57Ba3.30 0.39Bab3.37 0.32ab2.76 0.14bInosineCB75.15 15.04c87.81 9.05bc94.02 6.48b111.89 11.56AaWRMD273.46 13.5079.98 10.3285.33 11.5288.10 9.79BHypoxanthineCB6.30 0.92Bd11.95 2.12c16.12 1.15Ab19.30 1.36AaWRMD28.45 1.43Ac11.90 0.98b12.18 1.32Bb15.79 0.56BaATPCB8.26 0.27Ba8.26 0.40Ba6.40 0.94Bb7.27 0.42BbWRMD29.04 0.55Ab9.38 0.42Aab10.09 1.04Aa9.18 0.25AabADPCB6.10 0.24Aa5.86 0.41ab5.60 0.31Bab5.45 0.22bWRMD25.65 0.43Bb5.70 0.21b6.35 0.45Aa5.39 0.12bAMPCB10.41 0.82A10.41 0.40A9.95 0.5710.41 0.87AWRMD28.40 0.65Bc8.96 0.39Bbc10.25 0.76a9.36 0.39BabA,BDifferent letters represent significant differences between broiler and Woorimatdag No. 2 within the same storage period (P 0.05).a-dDifferent letters represent significant differences between storage days within the same chicken breed (P 0.05).IMP, inosine monophosphate;

viability inhibition and cellular inflammation, which could be partially attenuated by IL1R1 overexpression. | In the present study, we retrieved the main active compounds of herbs in JSK from TCMSP, analysed the targets of the main active compounds and SCI, employed Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) expression profiles to analyse differentially expressed genes between SCI and control samples and identified overlapped genes as hubgenes. | Screening of the active compounds was performed based on ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion), and using pharmacokinetic information retrieval filters, bioactive ingredients were retrieved for further analysis under screening conditions of OB 30 and DL 0.2 . | 2.2 Compound Targets and Disease Target Retrieval The protein targets of the active compounds in Huangqi, Danggui, Chishao, Chuanqiong, Taoren and Honghua were obtained from the PubChem database (https:pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). | 2.6 Construction and Analysis of Network

6 herbs in JSK were retrieved from Traditional Chinese Medicine System Pharmacology Database (TCMSP, http:lsp.nwu.edu.cntcmsp.php). | To comprehensively understand the molecular mechanisms of the 50 hubgenes upon SCI, Cytoscape software was used to construct the herbcompoundtarget (Figure 3A) and compoundtargetsignalling (Figure 3B). | The herbcompoundtarget network was constructed using Cytoscape to map the relationships between 50 differentially expressed drug target genes, their related active compounds and the herbs from JSK. | The MCC plugin in Cytoscape was used to identify the top active compounds based on their degree scores. | Among the 13 compounds, quercetin was found to have the highest MCC score, indicating that it has the most interactions with the identified target genes. | The network contains a total of 67 nodes and 255 edges, reflecting the complex interactions between the herbs, active compounds and their target genes (Figure 3A). | The herbcompoundsignalling pathway network was constructed to display the relationships between active compounds, their target genes and the signalling pathways they influence. | This herbcompoundtargetsignalling pathway network includes 81 nodes and 568 edges, highlighting the involvement of quercetin and other active compounds in key signalling pathways such as the NFκB signalling pathway, PI3KAkt signalling pathway and TNF signalling pathway, which are crucial in regulating inflammation and cell survival following spinal cord injury (Figure 3B). | FIGURE 3 Network

nodes represent signalling pathways, and the edges represent the interactions between compounds and pathways. | After quercetin treatment (SCI QUE group), the number of NeuNpositive neurons increased, suggesting a protective effect of quercetin on neuronal survival. | In the SCI QUE lvIL1R1 group, overexpression of IL1R1 restored its expression in neurons and partially reversed the protective effects of quercetin on neuronal survival and IL1R1 suppression (Figure 10C). | The herbcompoundtarget, herbcompoundsignalling and compoundtargetsignalling networks were generated using Cytoscape, and quercetin was identified as the hub compound, having the highest degree score among all active compounds, signifying its significant interaction with key target genes. | Moreover, the herbcompoundtarget, herbcompoundsignalling and compoundtargetsignalling networks were generated and quercetin was identified as the hub compound. | The herbcompoundtarget network, which mapped 50 differentially expressed drug target genes and their related active compounds, revealed the complex interactions between the herbs, active compounds and their target genes. | The compoundsignalling network highlighted quercetins involvement in key pathways, including NFκB, PI3KAkt, and TNF signalling, all crucial for regulating inflammation and cell survival following SCI . | Importantly, quercetin alone demonstrated therapeutic efficacy similar to that of the complete JSK formulation, indicating that quercetin might be the key active compound responsible for the observed benefits of JSK. | While network pharmacology provided valuable insights into the potential bioactive compounds, including quercetin, we did not quantify the exact concentrations of quercetin in each herb within the JSK formulation. | Future studies should focus more on performing a comprehensive chemical analysis to determine the precise levels of quercetin and other key compounds to complement the findings derived from network pharmacology and further elucidate their contributions to the therapeutic effects of JSK.","SCI (MISC), Jisuikan (MISC), J (MISC), Chinese (MISC), SC (MISC), Huang (PER), ##qi

11648568.xml,The role of neuroinflammation in cerebral amyloid angiopathy,"Two specific MMPs; MMP-2 and MMP-9, are of particular interest in the context of CAA, because these are expressed in smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells in blood vessels.59 To maintain tissue homeostasis, MMP activity is tightly regulated by controlling activation of pro-MMPs, transcription, and inhibition of active forms by specific tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs). | Interestingly, complement inhibitory treatment in the transgenic mice could protect against this bloodbrain barrier injury.29 Another mechanism was proposed by Zabel et al. | Patients with CAA-ri often have other systemic autoimmune diseases (such as hypothyroidism, Graves disease, and rheumatoid arthritis) and autoimmunity may play a role in the pathogenesis of CAA-ri, particularly in genetically susceptible individuals, as environmental triggers can lead to immune dysregulation.54 This hypothesis is further supported by case reports of patients developing CAA-ri while receiving systemic immunotherapy such as anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibodies,55 tyrosine kinase inhibitor,56 chemotherapy57 or monoclonal antibodies for cancer treatment.58 Notably, individuals carrying the ApoE ε4 allele exhibit heightened systemic inflammatory responses to intravenous LPS stimulation,4 potentially explaining the association with developing CAA-ri. | Potential treatment targets One of the most promising targets to date has been the inhibition of MMPs. In animal models, MMP inhibitors demonstrate efficacy in reducing MMP activation and oxidative stress, albeit without impacting CAA progression.67 Furthermore, minocycline treatment (known to have MMP inhibitory properties) in mice significantly decreases haemorrhage frequency and inflammatory markers in the brain without affecting vascular Aβ load.23 In a small group of patients with clinically aggressive CAA, minocycline appeared safe and generally tolerated and was associated with reduced haemorrhage occurrence.68 However, in a recent study of patients with moderate to severe non-CAA cerebral small vessel disease, minocycline treatment showed no correlation with changes in microglial signals as measured by PET-imaging and serum inflammatory markers were unaffected.69 To assess target engagement in a CAA patient population, the recently completed randomised controlled BATMAN trial aims to assess the effect of minocycline on markers of neuroinflammation (IL-6, MCP-1 and IBA-1) and the gelatinase pathway (MMP29 and VEGF) in CSF in patients with sporadic CAA and D-CAA.70 Another potential treatment option is to administer antioxidants, as they support the immune system by protecting cells from oxidative stress and damage caused by free radicals.","##C (MISC), CAA (MISC), CA (MISC), Alzheimers (MISC), A (MISC), CA (MISC), Amy (MISC), CA (MISC), CA (MISC), CA (MISC), Review (MISC), Pub (MISC), ##M (ORG), Embase (ORG), Web of Science (ORG), Cochrane (ORG), Ce (MISC), Amy (MISC), Amy (MISC), Amy (MISC), HC (ORG), Here (MISC), Amy (MISC), Here (MISC), Ce (MISC), Icelandic (MISC), Icelandic (MISC)"

VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor VEGFA vascular endothelial growth factor A 1 INTRODUCTION The intricate relationship between glial cells and neurons within the nervous system has long captivated neuroscientists. | The role of microglia in synaptogenesis is not limited to excitatory synapses but extends to inhibitory synapses. | Astrocytes secrete transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1) which regulates the formation of excitatory and inhibitory synapses and, in turn, the excitatory and inhibitory balance (Diniz et al., 2012, 2014). | Additionally, it has been demonstrated that the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) released by cultured astrocytes in the presence of neuronal activity improves myelination (Ishibashi et al., 2006). | (c) The potential for adult neurogenesis is tightly regulated by glial cells in an inhibitory manner by proinflammatory cytokine release or in a supportive manner by the release of neurotrophic factors. | Glia within the NVU are crucial components that ensheathe the endothelium forming a socalled secondary barrier, and nutrients required for CNS function are delivered from the blood vessels to neurons mainly via glia cells (reviewed by (Hurley et al., 2015)), while waste compounds are passed via glial cells to microglia or back into the bloodstream (reviewed by (Marina et al., 2018)). | By releasing several cytokines and neurotrophic factors such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), ATP, or brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), microglia contribute to neuronal excitability, partaking in the reorganization of synaptic receptors in neurons and glutamate release by astrocytes (Parkhurst et al., 2013; Pascual et al., 2012; Santello et al., 2011; Stellwagen et al., 2005). | As oligodendrogenesis persists into adulthood, OPCs receive excitatory and inhibitory signals and modulate circuit activity accordingly (Bergles et al., 2000; Lin Bergles, 2004). | On the other hand, proinflammatory cytokines released from microglia have an inhibitory effect on neurogenesis (Battista et al., 2006; Borsini et al., 2015). | In addition to microglia, astrocytes may also promote neurogenesis through the release of BDNF, fibroblast growth factor2 (FGF2), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and Dserine. | (a) Reactive microglia and astrocytes contribute to neuronal susceptibility to neuronal injury by withdrawing supportive factors such as trophic factors and antioxidants and secreting growth inhibitors, which further exacerbate neuronal sensitivity to oxidative stress. | (b) During injury or disease, secreted factors from glial scars result in the upregulation of several inhibitory molecules, which further compromise the ability for regeneration and recovery of damaged neurons. | The regenerative potential of the adult mammalian CNS is restricted by both intrinsic neuronal factors and extrinsic inhibitory factors originating from glial cells (reviewed in (Fawcett, 2020)) (Figure 3b). | Inhibitory molecules associated with myelin and the glial scar such as myelinassociated glycoprotein (MAG), NogoA, and oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein (OMgp), account for the inhibitory activity in the CNS. | Conversely, the use of chondroitinase to break down these inhibitory CSPGs has been shown to enhance axonal sprouting and functional recovery in rodent models of spinal cord injury (Rosenzweig et al., 2019). | Notably, embryonic neurons survive, integrate, and show substantial growth and functional impact when implanted into the adult CNS, regardless of the inhibitory conditions (Gaillard et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2012). | It has been reported that these astrocytes lose their capacity to promote neuronal survival and synaptogenesis and can contribute to neuronal death (Liddelow et al., 2017). | There are several lines of evidence linking inflammation to neuropsychiatric disorders using lipopolysaccharide (LPS; a component of gramnegative bacteria) as a robust activator of microglia and neuroinflammation. | Recently, Zheng and colleagues observed microglia activation and the release of proinflammatory cytokines in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), along with an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission after LPSinduced neuroinflammation (Zheng et al., 2021). | Furthermore, Zhang and colleagues demonstrated that microgliaspecific delivery of a complement inhibitor protects against dopaminergic neuron loss and rescues behavioral deficits associated with a mouse model of αsynuclein aggregation in vivo (Zhang et al., 2023b). | Moreover, microgliaspecific deletion of an AD risk gene, APOE4, resulted in decreased pathology and increased neuroprotection in both amyloid and tau mouse models (Yin et al., 2023). | In addition, smallmolecule inhibitors of NLRP3 block inflammasome activation in microglia and are sufficient to rescue dopaminergic neuron loss and motor deficits in a synucleinopathy model (Gordon et al., 2018). | Administration of a pharmacological necroptosis inhibitor has shown efficacy in reducing astrocyte reactivity and attenuating the loss of dopaminergic neurons and subsequent behavioral deficits in an MPTP model of disease (Qiao et al., 2023). | However, it should be noted that protection of neurons and reduction of astrocyte reactivity reported in this study could be because of the inhibitor acting directly on neurons. | Aged astrocytes have been shown to withdraw myelinating support, with rapamycin, a mTOR inhibitor, being able to reverse these effects and support oligodendrocyte differentiation (Willis et al., 2020). | In adulthood, this process is often hindered by the inhibitory environment of the CNS, particularly the extracellular matrix and the formation of glial scars, and the poor regenerative ability of mature neurons (reviewed by (Fawcett, 2020)). | Several neurotrophic factors, including BDNF, IGF1, and nerve growth factor (NGF), have been identified as key drivers of cytoskeletal reorganization and axonal outgrowth (reviewed by (Lykissas et al., 2007)). | By promoting physiological glial activity and attenuating nonphysiological aberrant activity, novel therapeutic interventions should aim to mitigate neuroinflammation, promote neuroprotection, and enhance neural repair processes.","##N (ORG), ##ong (ORG), International Society for Neurochemistry (ORG), ISN

the synthesized conjugates demonstrated antioxidant properties in addition to their ability to inhibit AChEinduced spontaneous and AChEinduced aggregation of βamyloid, thereby showing themselves to be multifunctional agents with potential capacities for disease modification or neuroprotection. | The spectrum of pharmacological activity of the hybrid compounds was provided by both the second

compared to compounds 7b,c, and 9b,c (Figure 5a,b). | The results show (Table 2) that the studied compounds at a concentration of 100 μM inhibit the selfaggregation of βamyloid at a level of 2096. | Compounds 7c, 9c, 10c with spacer (CH2)8 exhibited maximum inhibitory activity against Aβ42 (71.796.7), which corresponds to or exceeds the effectiveness of the reference compounds myricetin (79.4 6.3) and propidium iodide (90.7 7.1). | The current docking results also demonstrated that the binding of the studied compounds to the individual Aβ42 conformers differs rather significantly (see Figure 6). | Figure 7 presents the best binding poses for all studied compounds docked to the first conformer of Aβ42. | Figure 6 Interactions of the compounds with soluble forms of Aβ42. | (be) Binding poses of compounds 7a (b), 7c (c), 10a (d), 7c (e) to all 10 conformers of Aβ42. | Thus, all studied compounds preferentially were bound at the Nterminus of the peptide structure. | 47 , 48 With the increase of the linker length, coverage of this domain increased, which is in agreement with the increased antiaggregation potency of the compounds with linker elongation. | a TEACactivity of the compounds relative to Trolox (for calculation, see Section 4). | b IC50concentration of the compound required to reduce the concentration of the ABTS radical by 50. | As can be seen from Table 4, salicylimine derivatives 9ac were quite active in the ABTS test (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity 0.64 0.01), while changing the length of the spacer of conjugates did not affect the activity of compounds. | We observed significant changes when replacing the imine spacer with an amine one (compounds 10ac), whereupon the radicalscavenging activity increased by 2.3 times (TEAC 1.50 0.07). | As for model compounds 1214 based on salicylic derivatives, Nhexylsalicylamine 13 demonstrated the highest radicalscavenging (ABTSscavenging) activity (TEAC 1.52 0.07), equal to the activity of the corresponding conjugates, and a rather high initial rate of the ABTS binding reaction (within 1 min), while its salicylimine analog 12 had a radicalscavenging activity that was 10fold lower (TEAC 0.15 0.008). | 33 Interestingly, the model compounds demonstrated the same range of activities as their conjugates, while the effect of structure changes was more pronounced. | The lead compounds were conjugates of salicylamine 10ac. | Given that in the experiment no dependence of AOA on the spacer length was observed, one compound of each type with the shortest spacer (CH2)4, namely, 7a a , 9a a , 10a as (here subscripts mark protonation states as described above) was taken for calculations. | Quantum chemical calculations showed that the bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) of the OH group agrees with the AOA of the compounds under study (see Table 5). | The lowest BDE value was found for compound 10a as (83.5 kcalmol) with the highest AOA (TEAC 1.5), and the highest BDE value was found for compound 9a a (90.2 kcalmol) with the lowest AOA (TEAC 0.65). | Table 5 Calculated BDE values for the investigated compounds. | It can be assumed that the mechanism of the antiradical action of the studied compounds is Hatom abstraction from the OH group with electron transfer to the ABTS radical and simultaneous proton loss to the solvent (see Figure 8). | 2.2.9 Metalchelating properties UVVis spectroscopy was used to evaluate the ability of compounds to form metal complexes, as shown previously by other groups 50 , 51 and by us. | 16 In the present work, the ability of compounds 7c, 9c, 10c, which belong to three different groups of conjugates, to bind Cu2, Fe2, and Zn2 ions in EtOH solution was studied. | Figure 9 UV spectra of compound 10c and its mixtures with Cu2, Fe2, and Zn2

shift of absorbance values was calculated by subtraction of the sum of spectra of the compound and the corresponding ion from the spectra of the mixture. | The UV absorption spectra of compounds 7c, 9c, 10c contain two groups of bands. | The ligandmetal ion ratio in the Cu2 complexes was investigated for conjugates 7c, 9c, and 10c by mixing a fixed concentration of the test compound with increasing concentrations of the metal ion (250 µM) 52 (Figure 11 and Supporting Information S1: S51S54). | In the case of the 9cCu2 complex, the ligandmetal ratio was almost 2:1, which may also indicate a difference in the coordination of compound 9c with Cu2 compared to conjugates 7c and 10c (Supporting Information S1: Figure S54b). | Amiridine was included as a reference compound. | 53 , 54 , 55 The IC50 values (concentration of the compound resulting in a 50 decrease in cell viability) are listed in Table 7 and Supporting Information S1: Figures S56S61. | By this criterion, the least toxic compounds across all three cell types were amiridine, 7a, 9a, and 9c, whereas the most toxic compounds were 7c and 10c. | Within each cell type, compound 7a with a (CH2)4 spacer was less toxic than compound 7c with a (CH2)8 spacer. | The apparent trend of increasing cytotoxicity of the conjugates 7c, 9c, and 10c with spacer (CH2)8 and 7a, 9a, and 10a with spacer (CH2)4 compared with each other and to the reference compound amiridine may be due to the long length of the octamethylene spacer, which increases the lipophilicity of the studied compounds and, consequently, their cytotoxicity. | 56 2.2.11 Prediction of ADMET, physicochemical, and Pan Assay INterference compoundS (PAINS) profiles The results of our computational estimates of selected ADMET and physicochemical properties for compounds 7, 9, and 10 are shown in Table 8. | Most of the compounds had high predicted values for intestinal absorption, enabling their oral administration. | The cardiac toxicity risk

commonly accepted druglikeness guidelines, the predicted lipophilicities and aqueous solubilities, as well as the molecular weights of the compounds, were within or close to the desirable range for potential drug compounds, although the LogP values in some cases violated the original Ruleof5 limits (however, given that some of the compounds were outside of the model applicability domain, the

11650850.xml,Understanding immune system dysfunction and its context in mood disorders: psychoneuroimmunoendocrinology and clinical interventions,"It is important to highlight that transient low- or medium-grade neuroinflammatory processes can promote processes of neurodevelopment, neuroprotection, or tissue repair; however, if the stimuli that promote neuroinflammation are prolonged and become chronic over time or intensify, they can lead to neuronal damage mechanisms, cognitive dysfunctions, or the appearance of affective disorders . | More in detail, these cells are activated in the presence of certain inflammatory mediators, DAMPs or PAMPs, and are polarized in a pro-inflammatory (M1) phenotype, mainly involved in neuroinflammatory mechanisms or an anti-inflammatory phenotype (M2), more related to the repair and neuroprotective actions. | According to the literature, described processes include 1) reduced inhibitory gamma aminobutyric (GABA) input; 2) augmented glutamatergic input from extra-hypothalamic locations; 3) reduced inhibition by the CNS, responsible for the production of arginine vasopressin; 4) stimulatory influence on the HPA axis by different factors, including neuroinflammation ; andor 5) a deficient cortisol feedback effect due to the presence of glucocorticoid resistance . | Finally, there are other neuromodulators altered in affective disorders such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or neuropeptide Y that also have important effects on the immune system. | Both components counteract the detrimental effect of immune system dysfunction in several key brain regions in these disorders, mediating multiple processes such as neurogenesis, neuroprotection, or neuroplasticity . | Some of the intestinal microbiota bacteria are capable of producing tryptophan, although its most important function revolves around its metabolism, giving rise to a wide variety of compounds, among which the production of different antimicrobial substances stands out, or the synthesis of tryptophan, serotonin, kynurenine (Kyn), tryptamine, and indoles . | In fact, it has been shown how patients with affective disorders show a decrease in the levels of tryptophan, Kyn, and kynurenic acid (both with a neuroprotective effect), while the levels of their two main neurotoxic metabolites, 3-hydroxyKyn and quinolic acid (QA) tend to be increased in these subjects . | In this sense, different investigations have shown how different populations of the microbiota specifically modulate estrogen levels from the synthesis of the enzyme β-glucuronidase by the synthesis of mimic compounds obtained from the degradation of polyphenols (exerting effects similar to estrogens in the body), or by influencing the enterohepatic circulation of non-ovarian estrogens . | Among the main types of antidepressants, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and the selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are outlined, having described several mechanisms by which they exert their immunomodulatory action. | In a review prepared by McNamara and Lotrich , the use of atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine exerted important immunomodulatory effects, decreasing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines at the systemic level and by microglia, although the benefits they exerted they were higher when combined with other immunomodulatory agents such as celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitor, or ω-3 PUFA. | Simultaneously, lithium also seems to suppress the expression of several inflammatory pathways such as glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β), NF-κB and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), resulting in a decrease in COX-2, IL-β, and TNF-α and an increase in the expression of IL-2, IL-10, and in some cases IL-4, IL-6, and other pro-inflammatory cytokines . | Especially, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as celecoxib itself, cytokine inhibitors, and pleiotropic agents such as minocycline or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) have been tested in several studies, mainly in combination with other therapies andor immunomodulatory agents . | The context in which mindfulness exerts its immunomodulatory effect is also due to its inhibitory effect on the HPA axis and the improvement of the intestinal ecosystem , although the precise effect of this intervention on the microbiota and the immune system must be studied in greater depth. | Likewise, we must highlight the belonging of curcumin to a group of non-nutrient components or bioactive compounds derived from the secondary metabolism of plants called polyphenols, with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. | Some other examples are hydroxytyrosol from extra virgin olive oil and olives, resveratrol from grapes, blackberries, blueberries, and peanuts, phenolic compounds from coffee or tea; and many spices such as turmeric, ginger, cinnamon, thyme, oregano, etc. | Currently, there is a high interest in the manufacture of formulas rich in these compounds for their application to different inflammatory diseases (arthritis, asthma, atherosclerosis, diabetes) , and its consideration should not be less in psychiatric disorders. | The underlying mechanisms studied also include the modulation of the Kyn pathway, these bioactive compounds promoting an increase in tryptophan in the Kyn:tryptophan ratio, for the microbial production of serotonin . | Certainly, we could list an infinite number of natural compounds that deserve attention and that exert a regulatory role on the microbiota, the immune system, or oxidative stress. | This type of diet is based on the combination of highly complex carbohydrates rich in fiber (present in cereals, legumes, vegetables, and fruits), polyunsaturated fatty acids with antiatherogenic and anti-inflammatory properties (present in olive oil and nuts) and bioactive compounds with antioxidant properties (such as flavonoids, phytosterols, terpenes, and polyphenols) . | However, more studies are needed to analyze the mechanisms by which treatments modulate the immune system and the effects of the immune system as determinants of therapeutic success or failure of a specific therapy.Table 1Translational applications of critical biological markers based on PNIE interventionsBiological markerTranslational applicationsReferencesIL-1βPredictive marker: variation observed primarily with treatment using SSRIs;

Discussion This study revealed the first-time report on compound isolation ascertained by structure elucidation employing NMR technology from two Colocasia species, namely, C. | These revealed three bioactive flavonoids along with two triterpenoids and one monoglyceride in total, which sheds light on the polyphenol-rich candidacy of these plants, which may result in promising lead compounds for future drug discovery and development. | Dichloromethane fractions of both plants were used in phytochemical screening and isolation of compounds. | A total of four compounds were elucidated from the dichloromethane soluble fraction of C. | The compounds isolated from C. | Another three compounds were isolated from the dichloromethane-soluble fraction of C. | The 1HNMR spectrum (500 MHz, CDCl3) of compounds 1 and 4 (Figure 4) in CDCl3 indicated the presence of three methoxy groups at δH 4.04 (3H, s), δH 4.02 (3H, s), and δH 3.90 (3H, s). | Thus, the structure of compounds 1 and 4 can be concluded as penduletin. | The 1H NMR spectrum (400 MHz, CDCl3) of compound 2 (Figure 5) showed two triplets at δH 5.32 ppm and δH 5.28 ppm characteristic of the olefinic proton (H-12) of α- and β-amyrin, respectively. | The above data identified compound 2 as a mixture of α-amyrin (2a) and β-amyrin (2b) with a ratio of 4:3 based on the 1H NMR peak heights. | The structure of compound 3 can be proposed as a monoglyceride of saturated fatty acid. | Comparing all the spectral data on the structure of compound 3 with the previously documented study (Kavadia et al., 2017) supports identifying this compound as a monoglyceride of stearic acid with the structure drawn in Figure 6. | The 1H NMR spectrum (CDCl3, 500 MHz) of compound 5 (Figure 7) showed two aromatic systems, including one 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring with the doublet at δH 7.68 (2H, d, J 8.5 Hz), one tetra-substituted benzene ring with the 1H signals at δH 6.86 (1H, d, J 8.5 Hz), δH 7.46 (1H, d, J 8.5 Hz), and a 3,3-dimethyl-pyrano group. | Thus, the structure of compound 5 can be proposed as 7, 8-(3,3-dimethyl-pyrano)-4-hydroxy flavonol. | The 1H NMR spectrum (CDCl3, 500 MHz) of compound 6 shows signals that exactly match those of compound 5 (7,8-(3,3-dimethyl-pyrano)-4-hydroxy flavonol). | But the presence of additional peaks suggest the presence of another compound as a mixture. | Thus, the structure of compound 6 appeared as a mixture of 4,7,8-trihydroxy flavonol with 7,8-(3,3-dimethyl-pyrano)-4-hydroxy flavonol (compound 5) in a ratio of 1:2, according to the peak heights in the 1H NMR spectrum. | Interestingly, other compounds, especially a mixture of α- and β- amyrin, also showed noteworthy activity. | A monoester extracted from the plant showed relatively mild analgesic activity compared to other compounds, which invalidates its strong candidacy as a lead compound for further drug development exploration. | Among all the compounds, C5 showed the highest binding affinity with interactions of pi-sigma, alkyl, pi-alkyl, and conventional hydrogen bonds (Table 6; Figure 9 ). | The binding interactions for the other compounds are briefly depicted in Table 6. | These binding interactions in molecular docking are important as they determine the strength and stability of the ligand binding to the target protein, which directly influences the efficacy of a potential drug or inhibitor (Morris and Lim-Wilby, 2008). | µ, κ, and δ are the opioid receptors that modulate the activity of the enteric nervous system and the release of neurotransmitters, thereby influencing both stimulatory and inhibitory motor pathways. | The compound β-amyrin (C2b) exhibited the highest affinity among all the compounds, including alkyl bond interactions with the amino acids Tyr 140, Ile 180, Trp 183, Leu 184, and Ile 191 (Table 5; Figure 10). | The identified compounds were docked against the COX-2 enzyme to investigate the peripheral analgesic properties. | Therefore, COX-2 inhibitors are considered to work in chronic pain relief and post-surgical analgesia by reducing the production of prostaglandins responsible for inflammation, pain, and fever, along with the minimization of gastrointestinal side effects (Camu et al., 2003). | Diclofenac sodium is a well-established COX-2 inhibitor, and it interferes with the production of prostaglandin G2, which is the precursor to other prostaglandins (Kaur and Sanyal, 2011). | The compound β-amyrin (C2b) showed a higher docking score of 8.7 kcalmol than the standard and demonstrated a strong conventional hydrogen bond interaction with the amino acid Asp 347 (Tables 5, 6; Figure 11). | The ADMET study of the identified compounds also exhibited promising results, which are listed in Table 7. | However, the compounds α- and β-amyrin (C2a and C2b) each had two violations, and the monoglyceride of stearic acid (C3) compound had three violations. | The results suggest that the compounds C1C4 and C5 conform to Lipinski standards, signifying their oral safety and potential as promising candidates for medicinal purposes. | pkCSM is a novel approach to predicting pharmacokinetic and toxicological consequences that use graph-based signatures to represent the chemistry and topology of small compounds (Pires et al., 2015). | Table 7 shows that all the test compounds possessed negative water solubility values (log molL), suggesting that they are lipophilic, which promotes effective absorption (Kuentz and Arnold, 2009). | The bioavailability scores of all compounds were found to be 0.55. | None of the identified test compounds exhibited any hepatotoxicity. | Moreover, none of the compounds was found to inhibit hERG I, and except for C2a, C2b, and C5, none of them inhibited hERG II, indicating that these compounds may not be cardiotoxic (Muster et al., 2008). | Finally, from all the hypotheses of the in silico study, the identified compounds that gave promising docking scores with the respective receptors, adhered to Lipinskis rule, and conformed satisfactorily with pharmacokinetic and toxicological assumptions should be considered for their drug candidacy and further investigation. | Compared with existing therapeutic agents, the identified compounds exhibited remarkable effects in bioassays as well as remarkable binding affinities with the corresponding biomolecules. | The present study represents the first-time report on compound isolation from C. | Upon biological investigations, these compounds showed prospective antimicrobial, analgesic, and antidiarrheal potentials, justifying the tribal use of these taro vegetables. | Further extensive scientific research on the isolated compounds in dosage form on a clinical trial basis is highly recommended to ascertain their safety and efficacy profile and mode of action to ease the process of future drug discovery and development.","Col (ORG), ##ocasi (MISC), Schot (PER), Col (MISC), Hook

11652219.xml,Fructose-mediated AGE-RAGE axis: approaches for mild modulation,"Glycoxidation leads to irreversible modifications of biomolecules and damages to cellular constituents with the consequent formation of poorly degraded compounds, collectively named advanced glycation end products (AGEs). | Schiff bases are relatively unstable compounds that can be subjected to further isomerization (Heyns rearrangement) and formation of more stable Heyns adducts. | They are autoxidation of glucose, fructose and other monosaccharides (Wolff pathway), autoxidation of Amadori and Heyns compounds (Hodge pathway), and oxidative fragmentation of Schiff bases (Namiki pathway) (2, 11, 14, 32, 33). | Importantly, most biological damages caused by RCS are related to α-dicarbonyls (compounds with two adjacent reactive carbonyl groups), including glyoxal, methylglyoxal, 3-deoxyglucosone, 3-deoxyfructose. | This is likely because these compounds are about 20,000-fold more reactive than fructose and other reducing carbohydrates (31, 34, 35). | Generally, AGEs are highly heterogeneous group of compounds with different structures, sizes, and molecular weights. | The above demonstrates that RAGE is the multiligand receptor, which is able to bind various compounds with different structures, sizes, functions, stimulating thereby multiple downstream signaling cascades. | Both sRAGE forms are believed to be competitive inhibitors of RAGE. | Natural inhibitors of aldose reductase have been tested in many studies. | Generally, such phytochemicals as alkaloids, phenolic compounds, coumarins seem to be promising (114, 115). | Naturally occurring compounds and their synthetic analogs exhibit good inhibitory activity against glycation and RCSAGE formation (Figure 5, red arrow 4). | Among compounds with antiglycation activity are peptides such as glutathione and carnosine (32, 124128). | Interestingly, besides antiglycation activity, some compounds are powerful antioxidants and demonstrate inhibitory effects on aldose reductase (129), thereby affecting multiple points in the pathway from fructose to active RAGE. | For instance, sulforaphane effectively prevents AGE formation through the Nrf2 activation that in turn induces glyoxalase 1, the key enzyme of glyoxalase system that detoxifies α-dicarbonyl compounds (135137). | It is well demonstrated that widely used biguanide drug metformin, known for reducing blood glucose levels, also demonstrates the inhibitory effect at the early, intermediate, and late stages of glycation, and induces glyoxalase I activity, thereby reducing the level of α-dicarbonyl compounds and AGEs (120, 142, 143). | Regarding this strategy, using inhibitors of either RAGE or its downstream targets, as well as RAGE antagonists, appear to be the most effective approaches. | Various compounds have been tested both in vitro and in vivo to block the AGE binding sites of RAGE and to act as competitive inhibitors of RAGE interaction with intracellular effectors nessesary for signal transduction (91, 147, 148). | Nonetheless, supporters of mild approaches prompt to modulate AGE-RAGE pathway by using natural compounds instead of artificial inhibitors, as the latter may cause side effects. | An increasing number of recent studies demonstrate that bioactive compounds derived from different natural sources effectively block AGE-RAGE formation and reduce RAGE signaling (119, 149, 150). | Similarly, oleanolic acid demonstrated an inhibitory effect on HMGB1 release (139). | Therefore, we suggest that such ubiquitous compounds as ascorbic and oleanolic acids also lead to mild reduction of RAGE activity by decreasing the concentration of ligands for RAGE other than AGEs. Moreover, as effective antioxidants, both acids can break glycation-oxidation vicious cycle that leads to AGE formation. | In this regard, compounds such as sulforaphane, as well as ascorbic and oleanolic acids, that can control RAGE-mediated events at various points in the glycation-RAGE network, are valuable and promising bioactive components of functional foods for protecting against inflammation, aging and related disorders. | Furthermore, is it possible to optimize the RAGEsRAGE ratio by using appropriate doses of fructose and other natural compounds in our diets?","RAGE (MISC), RAGE (MISC), RA (MISC), RA (MISC)"

11652374.xml,Targeting the SMURF2-HIF1α axis: a new frontier in cancer therapy,"Thus, targeting this pathway could inhibit tumor growth and progression, suggesting that therapies combining CDK46 inhibitors with agents that modulate SMURF2 activity could enhance anti-cancer efficacy (13). | Further, studies demonstrate that CDK46 inhibitors, such as palbociclib, synergize with HSP90 inhibitors to reduce HIF1α levels and suppress cancer cell viability, even in Rb-deficient tumors. | Together, these findings suggest that CDK46 inhibitors may synergize with SMURF2s role in degrading HIF1α, presenting a promising combination strategy to target hypoxic pathways in cancer therapy (28). | Separately, studies on CDK46 inhibitors like palbociclib suggest that these inhibitors can reduce HIF-1α levels through an indirect mechanism, offering a novel approach to destabilizing HIF1α in a VHL-independent manner and potentially enhancing therapeutic outcomes (31). | Recent studies also demonstrate the efficacy of combining CDK46 with HSP-90 inhibitors, further inhibiting HIF1 activity and offering potential treatment enhancements for renal and colon cancers (26). | This synthesis of findings highlights the potential of kinase-targeted strategies and the importance of continued research into CDK inhibitors to combat tumors characterized by active HIF1α. | This approach, combined with the potential of combination therapies involving CDK and HSP-90 inhibitors, could significantly impact cancer progression and drug resistance by stabilizing HIF1α, suggesting a synergistic mechanism that broadens the scope of combating therapy resistance (1, 75). | 8 Heat shock proteins in cancer: modulating the SMURF2-HIF1α axis to overcome resistance Combining cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors with heat shock protein 90 (HSP-90) inhibitors presents a promising approach to destabilizing hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α) and inhibiting cancer cell growth. | HSP-90 emerges as a significant anticancer target (78, 79); however, compensatory induction of HSP-70 following HSP-90 inhibition reduces the efficacy of HSP-90 inhibitors by counteracting their therapeutic impact (79, 80). | The dual inhibition of CDKs and HSP-90 amplifies the reduction of HIF1α levels compared to either inhibitor alone, as this approach disrupts both phosphorylation-dependent stabilization and chaperone-mediated folding of HIF1α. | However, recent studies reveal challenges in HSP-targeted strategies, as Phase I trials combining HSP-90 inhibitor ganetespib with ziv-aflibercept encountered significant toxicity issues while aiming to counter resistance by concurrently targeting HIF1α stabilization and angiogenesis (86). | Research into strategies such as the concurrent inhibition of all HSP-90 paralogs and disruption of HSP90-Cdc37 protein interactions seeks to enhance the anticancer efficacy of HSP-90 inhibitors and mitigate compensatory effects from HSP-70 (87). | 10 Clinical development of HIF1α inhibitors 10.1 Emerging therapeutics targeting HIF1α The crucial role of HIF1α in cancer progression has catalyzed the development of numerous inhibitors targeting its various functions, which are currently under investigation in pre-clinical and clinical stages. | These inhibitors disrupt HIF1αs mRNA expression, protein synthesis, stabilization, dimerization with HIF1β, DNA binding, and transcriptional activity ( Figure 2 ). | Notably, MO-460, a compound derived from moracin-O, impedes HIF1α accumulation by targeting the protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2B1 (hnRNPA2B1), inhibiting the initiation of HIF1α translationa novel mechanism of action (94). | 10.2 Clinical trials and studies Various clinical studies further assess the efficacy of the inhibitors targeting the HIF pathway ( Table 2 ). | Another trial (NCT05119335) examines NKT2152, a HIF2α inhibitor, in advanced (ccRCC), exploring its potential to disrupt cancer growth by inhibiting both HIF2α and CDK46 (98). | Moreover, inhibitors like PX-478, EZN-2968 and other small molecules targeting HIF1α effectively reduce HIF1α protein levels, contributing to tumor regression and, in some cases, leading to prolonged disease stabilization (100102). | Thus, the crucial role of HIF1α in cancer progression has catalyzed the development of numerous inhibitors targeting its various functions, which are currently under investigation in preclinical and clinical stages. | These inhibitors disrupt HIF1αs mRNA expression, protein synthesis, stabilization, dimerization with HIF1β, DNA binding, and transcriptional activity. | In light of the emerging importance of the SMURF2-HIF1α axis, these developments could be enhanced by combining HIF1α inhibitors with strategies that modulate SMURF2 activity. | Future research should focus on developing specific SMURF2 inhibitors to enhance cancer cell sensitivity to ferroptosis, potentially overcoming resistance to other cell death mechanisms. | Table 3 delineates a spectrum of inhibitory strategies, each targeting distinct stages of HIF1-alphas lifecycle from transcriptional initiation to degradation, showcasing the depth of potential interventions. | α-amanitin, Actinomycin D, Triptolide Target nascent phase of HIF1α mRNA Stabilization Inhibitors EZN-2968 Bind HIF1α

or cancer cell lines reviewed by Bui and colleagues. | Table 4 Selected HIF1 inhibitors that underwent clinical or laboratory testing. | The inherent challenge in directly targeting transcription factors like HIF-1, which lack easily accessible active sites, is further complicated because many compounds that inhibit or activate HIF-1 lack isoform specificity. | Most available inhibitors are indirect and can alter mRNA expression or protein degradation, risking further off-target effects and potential resistance as cancer cells may activate compensatory pathways. | Some HIF-1α inhibitors have been reported to affect other signaling pathways, leading to off-target effects. | For instance, certain inhibitors may interfere with angiogenesis and normal cellular responses to hypoxia, raising concerns about their specificity and safety profiles (12). | Logistically, developing specific inhibitors that can precisely target the SMURF2-HIF1 interaction without affecting other pathways is challenging. | The complexity of the protein-protein interaction network in which these molecules operate necessitates highly selective and potent inhibitors, which are challenging to design and optimize. | Moreover, the pharmacokinetic properties of these inhibitorsensuring they are delivered effectively to the tumor site without degradation or unacceptable toxicitypose additional challenges. | Overcoming this would require combination therapies or next-generation inhibitors to prevent or circumvent resistance mechanisms. | Introducing compounds such as Pep7 reduces SMURF2s cellular levels, affecting cancer cell proliferation and augmenting cancer therapy by increasing the cytotoxicity of existing treatments (125). | This approach incorporates selected modifications in putative inhibitors to probe and optimize the interaction with the SMURF2-HIF1α complex. | Lead compounds would also be optimized for efficacy and to enhance their pharmaceutical properties. | At the El-Deiry laboratory, the synthesized compounds will be evaluated to assess their inhibition of the SMURF2-HIF1α interaction selectively. | It is part of a wider strategy to combine these inhibitors with current treatments, blocking survival pathways often activated in resistant tumors. | The main aim is to develop precision medicine, customize treatments to specific tumor traits, and thoroughly evaluate these compounds in clinical trials (75, 126). | The utilization of CDK46 inhibitors, such as palbociclib, has demonstrated a novel approach to reduce HIF1α levels and impair the hypoxic response in tumors. | 15.1 Proteomic insights and the role of SMURF2 Further investigation involved a proteomic screen on HIF1α immunoprecipitated from hypoxic colorectal cancer cells treated with CDK inhibitors. | The screen revealed that SMURF2, a SMAD-specific E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, was enriched in cells treated with the CDK46 inhibitor palbociclib, highlighting SMURF2s crucial role in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of HIF1α. | Knockdown experiments further demonstrated that reducing SMURF2 levels increased basal HIF1α expression, even in CDK inhibitors. | This pioneering work highlights the potential of targeting CDKs with specific inhibitors like palbociclib to destabilize HIF1α, offering fresh avenues to impede the hypoxic response integral to tumor survival and

abnormal protein aggregates, such as betaamyloid (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles, leading to cognitive decline and memory loss. | Current treatments for AD primarily offer symptomatic relief, with cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists showing limited success in slowing disease progression. | In contrast, microglia in the adult CNS display a ramified morphology, indicative of a surveillance state where they exert neuroprotective functions . | Hericium erinaceus, an edible and medicinal mushroom, has garnered attention for its neuroprotective properties, particularly in agerelated neurological disorders such as AD . | The mycelium of Hericium erinaceus (HEMy) contains bioactive compounds known as erinacines, which include cyathane diterpenoids such as erinacine A (HEA), erinacine C (HEC), and the recently identified sesterterpene erinacine S (HES) . | These compounds, isomers with similar molecular weights (Figure S1), have been previously reported to have neuroprotective effects primarily through promoting nerve growth factor (NGF) synthesis and exhibiting antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties . | By examining microglial morphology, functional phenotypes, and gene expression in mixed glial cultures, alongside assessments of glycemic control, nesting behavior, Aβ burden, plaqueassociated microglial activation, and neurogenesis in HFSTZAPPPS1 mice, we aimed to uncover novel mechanisms by which erinacines exert their neuroprotective effects. | The connectivity map (CMap) is a database that stores the gene expression profiles of numerous U.S. Food and Drug Administrationapproved drugs and other small molecules. | In summary, cortical homogenates were combined in equal amounts with a homogenization buffer that included 4 SDS and protease inhibitors. | These findings suggest that HEA promotes the differentiation of microglia into an antiinflammatory M2like phenotype, suggesting that erinacines promote microglia toward neuroprotective phenotype. | This analysis encompassed perturbagen classes (PCLs)categorized by mechanism of actionand perturbagen compounds (PCs). | Within group D4, the three predominant PCLs were bromodomain inhibitors, leucinerich repeat kinase inhibitors, and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. | Notably, HDAC inhibitors were identified as a shared PCL across groups D4, S1, and C1. |

were indicated. | For perturbagen compounds (PCs) with scores above 90.0, the D4 group matched with 60 PCs, the A1 group with 11 PCs, the S1 group with 51 PCs, and the C1 group with 52 PCs, as indicated in Table S1 and other data not shown. | Specifically, two PCs, XMD885 (a mitogenactivated protein kinase inhibitor) and XMD892 (an AMPK inhibitor), were common between groups D4 and A1. | Additionally, two PCs, apicidin and NCH51 (the HDAC inhibitors), were shared between groups D4 and C1. | Vemurafenib and pyroxamide, which act as an RAF kinase inhibitor and an HDAC inhibitor, were common between groups D4 and S1 (Figure 4A; Table S1). | Furthermore, one PC, WT171 (an HDAC inhibitor), was common among groups A1, C1, and S1. | This consistent association with HDAC inhibitors

depicted in Figure 5B and Table S4. | To confirm the involvement of HDAC in microglial phenotype changes, amoeboid DIFM1microglia were treated with HDAC inhibitors at DIV17. | Two acridinebased HDAC inhibitors, designated as 11b and 11 h, were utilized in this study. | Compound 11b demonstrates superior inhibitory activity against class IIa and class IIb HDACs compared to suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), while 11 h selectively inhibits HDAC6 . | Additionally, 11b has been identified as a multitarget inhibitor that affects HDAC, Aβ aggregation, and acetylcholine esterase (AChE). | Following HDAC inhibitor treatment, DIFM1microglia were activated with LPS (100 ngμl) as depicted in Figure 1. | Remarkably, DIFM1microglia treated with HDAC inhibitors 11b and 11 h exhibited ramification and developed elongated protrusions, indicating a transition to a surveillance state (Figure S3). | These observations suggest that HDAC inhibitors can promote microglia toward a ramified, surveillancelike state, and suppress microglial activation. | FIGURE 6 The effect of HDAC inhibitors on microglial phenotype changes in DIFM1. | Erinacines, the bioactive compounds of Hericium erinaceus mushroom, have been reported to have a neuroprotective effect in APPPS1 mice ; however, their potential to modulate microglial morphology, elucidate underlying mechanisms of action, and address metabolic dysfunction in AD has not been thoroughly investigated. | This highlights a previously unrecognized role of erinacines in maintaining microglial homeostasis, potentially contributing to their neuroprotective effects. | Moreover, HEA treatment of DIFM1microglia increased the expression of the M2 microglia marker CD206 and decreased the expression of the M1 microglia marker CD86, suggesting its potential to shift microglia toward a more neuroprotective state. | HDAC inhibition was identified as a key pathway, supported by our finding that erinacines closely resemble HDAC inhibitors in their mechanism of action. | This is significant because HDAC inhibitors have been shown to promote microglial ramification , suggesting that erinacines might regulate microglial morphology through similar pathways. | Treatment of DIFM1microglia with the HDAC inhibitors 11b and 11 h positively modulated microglia morphology, leading to a more ramified state. | Interestingly, HDAC inhibitors could induce microglia ramification and suppress DIFM1microglia activation after adding LPS, suggesting that HDAC activity is directly involved in maintaining a less inflammatory, more ramified microglial phenotype. | Thus, while HDAC inhibitors and erinacines both modulate microglial function, the unique effects of erinacines suggest that erinacines might influence microglia through a combination of HDAC inhibition and other, possibly maturationrelated, pathways. | Although erinacines have been shown to be neuroprotective in normal APPPS1 mice, metabolic stress can alter drug metabolism, distribution, and efficacy, leading to different therapeutic outcomes. | The ability of erinacines to shift microglia toward a more neuroprotective phenotype, reduce amyloidbeta accumulation, and improve metabolic parameters underscores their promise as a multifaceted therapeutic approach. | WeiJan Huang provided compounds 11b and 11h.","Herici

Half-Sandwich Complexes of 8-Hydroxyquinoline-Derived
Mannich Bases with Enhanced Solubility: Targeting Multidrug Resistant
Cancer,"The aim of the complexation was to obtain compounds with improved drug-like properties. | The nanocarriers showed faster drug release at acidic pH than at pH 7.4, and could retain the cytotoxicity and selectivity of the loaded compounds. | The encapsulated Rh(η5-C5Me5) complex of HQCl-pip has been identified as an optimal candidate for the pharmacological development of MDR-selective compounds. | Introduction Multidrug resistance (MDR) is considered to be as one of the major obstacles in chemotherapy.1 Its development is often associated with the overexpression of ATP-binding cassette transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (ABCB1P-gp), which leads to reduced drug levels in the intracellular space.13 Despite clinical failures,1 inhibition of the P-gp transporter is still considered a potential strategy to improve therapy.4 However, new approaches are also pursued, including research on compounds targeting the collateral sensitivity of P-gp-expressing MDR cancer cells.57 A large number of compounds capable of selectively killing MDR cells were identified with a large structural diversity, and data mining revealed that their possible mechanism of action is related to interaction with endogenous metal ions.8 In particular, we and others have demonstrated that MDR cells exhibit a surprising hypersensitivity to several metal chelating compounds, including isatin-β-thiosemicarbazone,8,9 1,10-phenanthroline,8,10,11 and 8-hydroxyquinoline (HQ) derivatives.5,6,8,10,1416 These results highlight the importance of complex formation with essential metal ions such as iron or copper, resulting in the formation of redox-active complexes or the potential depletion of metal ions.6,16 Indeed, it was shown, that iron complexation with 8-hydroxyquinoline-derived Mannich bases results in iron depletion in MDR cells via P-gp-mediated efflux of iron complexes.6,16 Moreover, a correlation was also found between the pKa values of the OH group of the HQ ligand scaffold and cytotoxicity against MDR cells within a library of 120 analogues.5 However, a recent study indicated that the MDR-selective toxicity of an 8-hydroxyquinoline-derived Mannich base (MX106-4C) relies on additional mechanisms linked to the P-gp-dependent inhibition of surviving, ATP deprivation and ROS production.17 It is noteworthy that HQ derivatives are also recognized for their beneficial medicinal properties,1822 often attributed to their strong metal ion chelating ability.5,6,8,10,1416,1820,2224 We have shown that the MDR-selective toxicity of HQs can be effectively improved by incorporating a CH2N subunit at the position 7 on the HQ scaffold, yielding the aforementioned 8-hydroxyquinoline-derived Mannich bases.5,6,10,25 These compounds often contain annular tertiary amines at position 7 as well as a halogen (mainly chlorine) substituent at position 5. | The compounds have demonstrated strong cytotoxicity against human uterine sarcoma cell lines and exhibited MDR-selective toxicity, with selectivity ratios (SRs) exceeding 10 in some cases.5,6,25 However, these compounds are often associated with limited bioavailability and in vivo applicability due to their poor aqueous solubility.12,13 To increase the hydrophilic character, we introduced polar groups into the HQ backbone, by incorporating proline and homoproline subunits. | Drug carrier systems, such as inorganic and polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes or nanomicelles are commonly used for targeted drug release.3840 Gangliosides (GMs) are sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids that are particularly abundant in the plasma membrane of mammalian neurons.41 Due to their potential role in the formation of tumor metastases and their overexpression in different types of cancers, they are considered as potential therapeutic targets.42 Moreover, these micellar biocompatible molecules have been used as drug carriers also for anticancer compounds,4345 e.g., paclitaxel and doxorubicin were successfully microencapsulated using GM1.46,47 Here we report the development of novel RhCp and RuCym complexes formed with two 8-hydroxyquinoline Mannich bases (5-chloro-7-(pyrrolidin-1-ylmethyl)quinolin-8-ol (HQCl-pyr) and 5-chloro-7-(piperidin-1-ylmethyl)quinolin-8-ol (HQCl-pip)) incorporated a (CH2N)-pyrrolidine or a (CH2N)-piperidine subunit at position 7 (Chart 2). | A ganglioside-based nanomicelle delivery system was developed to improve the bioavailability of the most potent compounds. | 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) measurements were carried out to confirm the structure and purity of the compounds (see Experimental section and NMR spectra in Figures S1 and 4). | The ORTEP representation of the compound is depicted in Figure 1 and the unit cell containing four complexes is shown in Figure S14. | This compound is also more lipophilic than its derivative, PHQ (Chart 2, log D7.4 0.9325) due to the presence of the chlorine substituent. | Comparing the logD7.4 values of the compounds (14) with those of the ligands HQCl-pyrpip (Figure 4), it is clear that the half-sandwich complexes are significantly more hydrophilic, which enhances their applicability in vivo. | This protein plays a key role in transporting many different types of endogenous and exogenous compounds. | Ganglioside-based Nanomicelles: Preparation and Characterization Nanomicelles are considered as effective pharmaceutical carriers for solubilizing hydrophobic drugs, and their outer hydrophilic corona protects the construct from recognition and removal by the reticuloendothelial system, resulting in extended circulation times.58 Additionally, nanomicelles disintegrate very slowly due to their inertness, which helps them maintain their integrity and drug content until they reach their target site, thereby increasing the drugs bioavailability.59 Gangliosides are amphiphilic materials, so they can form nanomicelles and entrap hydrophobic molecules or compounds containing a hydrophobic part. | GM1 and GM3-sphingosine (GM3-sph) gangliosides were selected for the encapsulation of the most promising compounds, HQCl-pip, and its RhCp complex, (3), respectively. | A significantly faster release of the encapsulated compounds was observed from both types of nanomicelles at pH 5.5, which is characteristic of the tumor microenvironment, compared to pH 7.4. This is advantageous as it ensures that drug release is minimized in the blood and enhanced at the targeted tumor site. | Both compounds reached a plateau after 24 h in acidic medium, while complex (3) demonstrated a continuous, sustained release of the complex at pH 7.4. GM1-HQCl-pip was not stable at pH 7.4 after 24 h, as evidenced by the decrease in the release, indicating its degradation. | The IC50 values (Table S5) further confirmed the robust MDR selectivity of these compounds. | As compared to PHQ, HQCl-pyr and HQCl-pip showed increased selectivity against MDR cells, consistent with our previous observations in monocultures.5,25 As expected, in the presence of the specific P-gp-inhibitor tariquidar (TQ), the IC50 values remained nearly unchanged in the parental P-gp-negative MES-SA cells. | The ligands and their RhCp complexes showed a moderate antimicrobial effect (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 50 or 25 μM in Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively) in all bacterial strains. | Based on these characteristics, HQCl-pip and its RhCp complex, as the most promising compounds, were selected to be encapsulated in GM1 and GM3-sph gangliosides, respectively. | The nanomicelles showed a high encapsulation efficiency with relatively good stability at pH 7.4. The nanoformulated compounds were tested in a triple coculture of MES-SA, MES-SADx5 and MES-SAB1 cells, where they exhibited significant MDR-selective activity. | Based on its enhanced solubility, stability, and retained MDR-selective toxicity, our results identify the RhCp complex of HQCl-pip encapsulated in ganglioside-functionalized nanoparticles as an optimal candidate for the pharmacological development of MDR-selective compounds. | Samples contained 100 μM compounds (ligand or complex) in methanol (LC-MS grade). | The compounds were dissolved in buffered aqueous solutions previously saturated with n-octanol. | The concentration of the compounds was determined by UVvis spectrophotometry. | For calibration, stock solutions of the compounds were used with known concentrations dissolved in 100 DMSO, 75 DMSO, and 50 (vv) DMSObuffered aqueous solutions. | In order to check the purity of the isolated organometallic complexes, measurements were performed at 50100 μM compound concentration with the corresponding ligands and precursors as well. | Selected bond lengths and angles of compounds were calculated by PLATON software.73 Graphical representation and the edition of CIF files were done by Mercury74 and Encipher75 softwares. | The tested compounds were dissolved in 50 (vv) DMSOPBS buffer to prepare 510 mM stock solutions, which were diluted in complete culture medium. | Serial dilutions of the compounds were added 24 h after seeding. | To address the effect of P-gp function, TQ was added at a nontoxic concentration (0.4 μM) 15 min before the test compounds. | MIC values of the compounds were determined in 96-well plates based on the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute guidelines (CLSI guidelines).76 The stock solutions of the compounds (same as those used for cytotoxicity experiments) were diluted in 100 μL of Mueller Hinton Broth. | The plates were further incubated at 37 C for 18 h; at the end of the incubation period, the MIC values of the tested compounds were determined by visual inspection.","MD (MISC), Mannich (MISC), MD (MISC), MD (MISC)"
11653477.xml,Physical exercise-mediated neuroprotective mechanisms in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and epilepsy,"This review delves into key aspects including the modulation of neuroinflammation, neurotrophic factors, and synaptic plasticity. | Recent studies clarified how physical exercise modulates neuroinflammatory processes (2, 3), promotes the production of neurotrophic factors (4), increases synaptic plasticity (5, 6), and controls redox balance. | The neuroprotective effects of exercise are evident in several neurological diseases, such as Parkinsons disease (PD), Alzheimers disease (AD), and epilepsy, highlighting how physical exercise influences cellular neuromechanisms. | Although influenced by the intensity and duration of exercise, an acute response to physical exercise increases blood flow and neurotrophic factors (25, 26), whereas adaptive responses include the upregulation of antioxidants and repair enzymes and redox regulation by different neurotrophic, synaptogenic, angiogenic, and neurogenic processes (27) (Figure 1). | The aerobic exercise triggers the release of muscle-derived exerkines, which in turn enhance the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) via the PI3KAKT signaling pathway. | For example, studies have revealed that the upregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is among the main molecular mechanisms induced by physical exercise in patients with PD, which may improve motor and non-motor symptoms (3,4,19,28- 30). | BDNF belongs to a family of neurotrophic factors that bind to and activate tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), which regulates several small G proteins, including Ras, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), PI3-kinase, and phospholipase-C-γ (PLC-γ) pathways. | BDNF levels in the peripheral and specific brain regions promote different responses, each contributing uniquely to the neuroprotective effects of physical exercise. | For example, serum BDNF levels can reflect systemic changes and overall neurotrophic support (29, 31). | BDNF levels in brain regions are directly related to local neuronal health, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function, providing targeted neuroprotection and promoting neuronal survival (33, 34). | Both aerobic and strength training exercises offer significant benefits in mitigating the motor and non-motor symptoms of PD by leveraging the mechanisms of neuroprotection and neuroplasticity associated with increased BDNF expression (34). | Nrf2 acts directly on brain redox regulation and promotes transcriptional activity, increasing BDNF expression and crosstalk between antioxidant signaling pathways and neurotrophic factors. | In summary, the mechanisms regulated by physical exercise in patients with PD modulate neurotrophic factors and oxidative stress, thereby contributing to synaptic plasticity, inflammatory control, and mitochondrial function. | Exercise characteristics, such as type, intensity, frequency, and duration, should be considered to promote long-term neuroprotective responses. | The right side illustrates how regular exercise exerts beneficial modulatory effects on Alzheimers disease, including insulin sensitivity, cognitive enhancement, and elevation of neurotrophic factors that promote neuronal health and survival. | Exercise improves brain metabolism, blood flow, and mitochondrial function by stimulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1α and Nrf-2. | Irisin and cathepsin B improve the function of BDNF, a neurotrophic factor that increases hippocampal neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, spinal dendritic cells, neurotransmitter receptors, and synaptic proteins, thereby improving learning and memory (59). | In an animal model of AD, neurotrophic factors are decreased and associated with cognitive deficits (60), whereas exercise is a known neurotrophic inducer (61). | Insulin is currently recognized as a neurotrophic factor whose impairment in the brain causes AD. | Among these, the modulation of neurotransmitters, neurotrophic factors, and brain metabolism are key factors that may interfere with seizure susceptibility. | Adenosine, a by-product of energy metabolism and ATP utilization, can act as a seizure inhibitor. | Considering that physical exercise modulates hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity and the synthesis and release of several neurotransmitters such as serotonin, noradrenaline, and dopamine as well as upregulates neurotrophic factors, exercise under epileptic conditions may reduce stress and decrease seizure susceptibility. | However, it is necessary to understand the different types, intensities, durations, and frequencies that exert neuroprotective effects in PD, AD, and epilepsy.","Parkinsons (MISC), Alzheimers (MISC), PubMed (MISC), Web (MISC), of (ORG), Science (MISC), Google Scholar (MISC), Alzheimers (MISC), Parkinsons (MISC), Parkinson (MISC), Alzheimer (MISC)"

potential cancer treatment. | The review highlights the significance of this pathway in immune evasion and tumor progression while exploring the therapeutic potential of natural compounds in restoring antitumor immunity. | Challenges and future directions Despite the promising potential of targeting the PD-1PD-L1 signaling pathway with bioactive natural compounds, several challenges and pitfalls warrant consideration. | Bioavailability and proper delivery of these compounds remain hurdles, necessitating innovative formulations to ensure efficient cellular uptake. | Furthermore, individual variability in response to these compounds and potential off-target effects require comprehensive clinical investigations. | Our review also underscores the lack of clinical trials investigating the effects of natural compounds, providing a holistic view of the current research landscape. | Despite their potential anticancer effects, these compounds face numerous challenges and limitations, such as limited permeation across the cell membrane, low solubility in aqueous media, poor bioavailability, short duration in blood circulation, rapid enzymatic degradation, and an inability to distinguish cancer cells from normal cells, which can lead to serious adverse effects and organ toxicity. | The thorough examination of metabolites, small molecules involved in cellular functions, is known as metabolomics. | These techniques can advance our knowledge of the therapeutic potential of these natural compounds and facilitate the development of innovative phytochemical-based medicines by providing insights into metabolic pathways and alterations in gene expression. | Interdisciplinary approaches that combine natural compounds with synthetic drugs or other therapeutic modalities present promising avenues for developing novel and effective treatments. | By leveraging the strengths of both natural compounds and synthetic drugs, these interdisciplinary strategies can offer innovative solutions to address complex health challenges and improve patient outcomes. | Our work underscores the need for future research to address these challenges and facilitate the successful integration of bioactive natural compounds into cancer therapy. | Investigating innovative delivery systems, such as nanoparticles or liposomes, could enhance the bioavailability of these compounds and improve their therapeutic efficacy. | Furthermore, a comprehensive exploration of the synergistic potential between natural compounds and existing immunotherapies could unveil novel combination approaches for enhanced antitumor responses. | Ultimately, we hope that this work lays a foundation for future research endeavors that hold the promise to reshape cancer therapy through the

11654382.xml,BDNF augmentation reverses cranial radiation therapy-induced cognitive decline and neurodegenerative consequences,"Previous human studies revealed a marked reduction in plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) post-chronic chemotherapy, linking this decline to a substantial cognitive dysfunction among cancer survivors. | Spatial transcriptomic profiling comparing the RT Vehicle with the RT RZ group showed gene expression signatures of neuroprotection of hippocampal excitatory neurons post-RZ. | In summary, oral administration of RZ represents a viable and translationally feasible neuroprotective approach against RICD.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186s40478-024-01906-9. | Clinical investigations have revealed a noteworthy correlation between the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cognitive outcomes in cancer patients exposed to systemic chemotherapy . | Based on this scientific premise, we hypothesize that RT-induced impairments in neuronal function, elevated neuroinflammation, and cognitive deficits culminate following reductions in neuroprotective BDNF. | As a proof of principle to support a neurotrophic factors influence on the damaged, irradiated brain, we focused on male mice for this study. | Riluzole treatment augments hippocampal BDNF levels in the irradiated mice The above cognitive function data indicates a neuroprotective impact of RZ treatment in the irradiated brain. | This data signifies the neuroprotective impact of RZ treatment in the irradiated brain leading to reductions in gliosis and cognitive dysfunction.Fig. | Importantly, we found upregulated expression of an IEG, nptx1, which is known to play a role in synaptic plasticity and neuroprotection, in the hippocampal excitatory neurons in the RT RZ group compared to RT Veh group (Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, average log2-fold change 0.27, FDR-adjusted P 1016). | These findings suggest that RZ treatment counteracts cranial RT-induced neurodegeneration by enhancing neuroplasticity and neuroprotection in the hippocampus through the upregulation of key immediate early genes in excitatory neurons.Fig. | B The UMAP visualization of 10 major cell types identified within the hippocampus, including excitatory neurons from the CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) regions, inhibitory neurons, and non-neuronal (glial) cells including astrocytes (AST), microglia (Mic), oligodendrocyte granule cell and precursor cell (OGC, OPC), pericyte (Peri), endothelial cells (Endo). | Scale bar, 0.5 mm, (A) Discussion This study verifies the neuroprotective role of riluzole treatment-mediated in vivo BDNF enhancement against cranial RT-induced cognitive dysfunction. | Our hypothesis that enhancing levels of a neurotrophic factor in the irradiated brain would improve cognitive function is based on the scientific premise showing a correlation between BDNF levels and brain function. | Conversely, neuroprotective effects of BDNF-mediated cognitive recovery in a 20 Gy acute cranial RT model were blocked following treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that disrupts BDNF signaling . | A number of studies also suggest a positive correlation between improved cognitive indices and BDNF in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy , thus supporting our hypothesis that in vivo BDNF enhancement is neuroprotective against cranial RT-induced cognitive decline. | BDNF has been shown to play neuroprotective and functional roles in maintaining neuronal and dendritic health, activity-dependent neuronal plasticity, and cognitive function . | NT3, similar to BDNF, is a neurotrophic factor and plays an important role in neuronal development, synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity . | Collectively, this data supports the neuroprotective role of RZ treatment and BDNF augmentation in preserving mature, excitatory neuronal function in the irradiated brain and, thereby, cognitive recovery. | 7), neuroprotective effects of RZ treatment can also positively impact other neural functions, including increasing LTP, reducing neuronal glutamate release, increasing glial glutamate reuptake, and inhibiting glutamatergic receptor activity that may influence irradiated brain function. | In vitro experiments using primary mouse astrocytes showed a two to threefold increase in BDNF, GDNF (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor), and NGF (nerve growth factor) synthesis 24 h after initiation of RZ treatment . | Thus, both neurotrophic and neuronal mechanisms may contribute to the beneficial neurocognitive impact of RZ on the irradiated brain. | Nonetheless, this study provides proof of concept that in vivo augmentation of BDNF via oral administration of RZ in radiotherapy-injured brain is neuroprotective. | Conclusion Our data provides pre-clinical evidence for a translationally feasible approach: oral administration of an FDA-approved compound, riluzole, to enhance BDNF in vivo to ameliorate cranial radiation therapy-induced adverse impact on synaptic integrity, neuronal plasticity, neuroinflammation, and cognitive function.","R (MISC), ##D (MISC), ##D (MISC), R (MISC), FDA (MISC), ALS (MISC), ##D (MISC), ##D (MISC), ##D (MISC), ##T Vehicle (ORG), RT RZ (ORG)"

Buhner et al., 2022), and upregulate brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA and protein, leading to improved behavioral and cognitive outcomes in SZ animal models (Phensy et al., 2017; Aslanlar et al., 2024). | 3.2 Sulforaphane Sulforaphane (SFN) is a naturally occurring organic sulfur compound found in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, and mustard greens, characterized by its unique isothiocyanate group (Kamal et al., 2020). | Furthermore, SFN may activate Nrf2 by initiating the transcription of trigger receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) in the medial PFC (mPFC), increasing the expression of the M2 microglial marker arginase 1 (ARG1), which may alleviate depressive phenotypes through its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective functions (He et al., 2022). | 3.3 Alpha-lipoic acid Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a natural compound commonly found in the diet, serving as a crucial cofactor for mitochondrial respiratory enzymes and playing a vital role in maintaining cellular oxidative metabolism (Holmquist et al., 2007). | 3.6 Selenocompounds Selenium is the active center of GPX, and recent advancements have led to the development of various mimetics designed to replicate GPX functions (Ferreira et al., 2021). | The antioxidant mechanism of selenocompounds primarily involves the direct reaction of selenium atoms with free radicals generated by oxidative stress, thereby reducing the number of free radicals (Bartolini et al., 2017). | Animal studies have demonstrated the antidepressant and anti-anxiety properties of selenium compounds. | Liquiritigenin display neuroprotection through exerting anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activities to suppress neuronal apoptosis (Chiu et al., 2018). | Selenium and its compounds show considerable potential in regulating nervous system functions, alleviating stress responses, and preventing mental illnesses. | 3.7 Flavones Flavonoids are low-molecular-weight compounds that belong to a class of plant secondary metabolites characterized by a polyphenolic structure. | Research has shown that 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) can alleviate SZ-like symptoms by effectively mimicing the effect of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the brain (Jaehne et al., 2021) to selectively activate tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB) (Emili et al., 2022) and downstream Phospholipase C (PLC), AKT, and ERK12 signaling pathways. | Similarly, the natural flavonoid 4,5,7-trihydroxyflavone boosts the neurotrophic effects of BDNF by strengthening TrkB receptor signaling (Gao et al., 2023). | Another review has discussed the role of zinc in regulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its impact on neural function, suggesting that the combination of zinc supplementation with antidepressants can effectively treat major depressive disorder (Mlyniec, 2021). | In the small intestine, the absorption of polyphenolic compounds is limited, hence the majority of these compounds reach the colon where they interact with the gut microbiota, exerting their oxidative activity (Ozdal et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2022). | Concurrently, polyphenolic compounds can exert neuroprotective effects by regulating adult neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and neuroplasticity, as well as the activation of microglia (Godos et al., 2020). | 4 Mechanisms underlying the effect of antioxidants on neuropsychiatric disorders The mechanisms through which antioxidants impact neuropsychiatric disorders can be summarized into several key areas: neuroprotection, synaptic regulation, modulation of microglial activity, and neurotrophic effects (as depicted in Figure 2). | Figure 2 The mechanisms through which antioxidants impact neuropsychiatric disorders, including: (A) neuroprotection, which shields neurons from damage; (B) synaptic regulation, which modulates the transmission of signals between neurons; (C) modulation of microglial activity, which influences microglia polarization; and (D) neurotrophic effects, which support the growth and survival of neural cells. | Similarly, ascorbic acid mitigates the production of ROS triggered by antipsychotic medications, thereby providing neuroprotective benefits (Dakhale et al., 2005;

This process is known as two-step engulfment.-Tethering receptors like Tim-4 can promote efferocytosis without interacting with their co-receptors, but they may have biochemical interactions with co-receptors, such as Mertk.4Degradation of ACs Phagocytosis degrades ACs by creating phagosomes that become more acidic and eventually join with lysosomes for AC collapse.-LAP accelerates the process by maturing phagosomes more efficiently, leading to faster AC degradation.-Phagocytes experience a doubling of intracellular contents during efferocytosis, leading to the release of some contents and adjustments in metabolism to maintain appropriate levels.-Engulfment receptors recognizing PS and AC-derived sterols activate LXR and PPAR, resulting in altered energy metabolism and cholesterol efflux.-Alterations in energy metabolism impact the bodys ability to fight inflammation by promoting the generation of anti-inflammatory cytokines and altering glucose transport and lactate release during efferocytosis.5Anti-inflammatory responses -Efferocytosis is associated with an anti-inflammatory response that involves the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 TGF-β) and the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α IL-1β).-Nuclear receptors (e.g., LXR PPAR) are activated by binding to AC-derived ligands, leading to the upregulation of genes involved in

shown great potential for enhancing efferocytosis, the process of clearing ACs. These diverse plant-derived molecules possess various bioactive properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activities . | Moreover, the use of an ERK5 inhibitor reduces the phagocytic activity of RAW264.7 cells (a macrophage cell line) in laboratory settings. | Various compounds originating from natural sources may provide a great possibility in this area (Table 2). | Anti-atherogenic compounds found in nature, such as phytochemicals, have the ability to modify the pharmacological targets of trained immunity. | EGCG also demonstrated inhibitory effects on the overexpression of type A scavenger receptor (SR-A) induced by Ox-LDL in the identical cell line, resulting in a reduction in the absorption of Ox-LDL and the formation of foam cells . | The inhibitory effect of curcumin on the activation of NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in macrophages has been established through numerous scientific investigations. | This inhibitory effect is critical for preventing HFD-induced insulin resistance and the activation of the LPS-priming and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways in macrophages . | Furthermore, quercetin, a naturally occurring compound, has the ability to mitigate the development of atherosclerosis by modulating the occurrence of endothelial cellular senescence induced by Ox-LDL . | The potential of phytochemical-rich compounds in treating atherosclerosis by focusing on their ability to induce effective autophagy (not excessive) and efferocytosis. | Specifically, the neuroprotective effects of berberine, 6-gingerol, and celosins through autophagy induction are evident in important disorders . | 6-gingerol exhibits neuroprotective effects by inhibiting inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress through autophagy activation. | Hence, efferocytosis is significantly important for promoting neuronal survival and facilitating axonal regeneration. | The neuroprotective effects of these compounds have been observed to depend on both the dosage and duration of exposure, as indicated by several studies. | The neuroprotective effects of phytochemicals are believed to be mediated through various mechanisms. | While the antioxidant properties of dietary phytochemicals have been extensively studied, it has been demonstrated that these compounds cannot only scavenge free radicals in the brain but also specifically target stress-activated signaling pathways that play crucial roles in neuroprotection. | These proteins include antioxidant enzymes, neurotrophic factors, and anti-apoptotic factors . | This effect results in the development of an anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective phenotype in LPS-activated microglia . | Curcumin, when present at concentrations ranging from 5 to 25 μM, exerts its neuroprotective effects through the activation of the Aktnuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. | Thus, Nrf2 plays a critical role in mediating the neuroprotective effects of curcumin against oxidative damage . | The neuroprotective properties of curcumin are also attributed to its ability to modulate Sirt1. | Recent findings suggest that Sirt1 signaling activation is linked to the neuroprotective effects of curcumin. | Thus, modulating efferocytosis pathways represents a promising therapeutic approach for these autoimmune-related disorders by several phytochemicals, such as curcumin, crocin, PCA, and baicalein (for more details see Table 3).Table 3Clinical trials investigating the safety and efficacy of phytochemicals in regulating inflammation

QSAR Modeling of RET Kinase Inhibitors
from 49 Different 5,6-Fused Bicyclic Heteroaromatic Cores to Patent-Driven
Validation,"This study focuses on exploring the design principles of potent RET inhibitors through molecular docking and 3D-QSAR modeling of 5,6-fused bicyclic heteroaromatic derivatives. | First of all, RET inhibitors of 49 different bicyclic substructures were collected from five different data sources and selected through molecular docking simulations. | QSAR models were built from the 3399 conformers of 952 RET inhibitors using the partial least-squares method and statistically evaluated. | The optimal QSAR model exhibited high predictive performance, with R2 (of training data) and Q2 (of test data) values of 0.801 and 0.794, respectively, effectively predicting known inhibitors. | The optimal model was doubly verified by patent-filed RET inhibitors as the out-of-set data to demonstrate acceptable residual analysis results. | Moreover, feature importance analysis of the QSAR model outlined the impact of substituent characteristics on the inhibitory activity within the 5,6-fused bicyclic heteroaromatic core structures. | Furthermore, the relationship between structure and inhibitory activity was successfully applied to the RET screening of known clinical and nonclinical kinase inhibitors to afford accurate off-target prediction. | Notably, the occurrence of brain metastasis among RET-altered patients, RET() stands at 46, markedly higher than that observed in RET() counterparts.5 Although rare, RET rearrangements delineate a distinct subtype of metastatic colorectal cancer characterized by poor prognosis under conventional therapies, warranting specialized management approaches.6 Following pivotal clinical trials, multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) and selective RET inhibitors have received FDA approval for the management of radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer or metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC).7 Notably, Selpercatinib (also known as Retevmo or LOXO-292) has been granted Accelerated Approval by the FDA.8 This approval applies to the use of the RET kinase inhibitor in patients with metastatic NSCLC harboring RET fusions, as well as those with MTC harboring RET mutations. | Recent data demonstrate the efficacy of Selpercatinib over standard care therapy in cancer types characterized by recurrent RET alterations.9 Although RET inhibitors (Figure 1) have been continuously reported, quantitative structureactivity relationship (QSAR) models and other predictive models have not been sufficiently studied. | To our best knowledge, reported 3D-QSAR models for RET kinase inhibitors used a focused data set sharing one common core structure (scaffold) such as indolin-2-one10 or pyrrolopyrimidine.11 However, the ideal design of kinase inhibitors necessitates the replacement and variation of both core structures and side chains to optimize the synthetic method, drug efficacy, and ADMET.12 Heterocycle substitution, among several scaffold hopping strategies, offers a direct means of modifying the core structure of a known bioactive compound, which is especially beneficial for molecules posing synthetic hurdles. | This method entails the replacement of carbon atoms with heteroatoms within the core ring of drug molecules, with the goal of improving their physicochemical properties and pharmacokinetic profile.13 Moreover, recently reported considerable RET inhibitors commonly possess a 5,6-fused bicyclic ring that interacts with the hinge region of RET kinase, and it is termed a hinge binder.14,15 Particularly, a 5,6-fused bicyclic ring was more frequently used in RET-selective inhibitors than in multikinase inhibitors. | Figure 1 Summary of FDA-approved RET inhibitors. | Abbreviation: TKI, tyrosine kinase inhibitor; DTC, radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer; MTC, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer; NSCLC, nonsmall-cell lung cancer. | Therefore, we believe that researchers involved in the discovery of kinase inhibitors have a strong need to investigate the sophisticated SAR between these 5,6-fused bicyclic derivatives. | For this purpose, herein, we collected RET inhibitors from public databases, classified them based on the ring system of their hinge binders, and compiled a comprehensive data set of 49 different 5,6-fused bicyclic heteroaromatic rings with 952 inhibitors as a data set. | Furthermore, the evaluation of the best QSAR model is presented to provide guidance on the rational design of selective and potent RET inhibitors. | In particular, RET inhibitors filed in the patent were used as an out-of-set third data, which never include either training or test data. | In parallel, the RET model was applied for RET screening as an off-target prediction of known kinase inhibitors. | 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Data Collection and Preparation Information on RET kinase inhibitor activity was retrieved from the ChEMBL (version 33),16 BindingDB,17 and Excape18 databases. | Information from 4763 RET inhibitor patents and other sources was compiled and curated using the KNIME workflow. | The evaluation of activity data within the target category, conducted using wild-type, noncell-based assays, employed specific criteria to focus on data points related to target proteins, such as Kinesin-1 heavy chaintyrosine-protein kinase receptor RET, proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor RET, and tyrosine-protein kinase receptor RET, where inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were measured in nanomolar (nM) units. | 2.2 Molecular Docking Simulations Every ligand for molecular docking simulations was prepared using the Ligprep package from Schrödinger.21 2D-to-3D conversion includes options for neutralizing compounds under the pH range of 7 222 and not generating tautomers. | The resulting structures of the 4763 compounds were docked to the RET protein. | The crystal structure of the RET complex with inhibitors is available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 7DUA),23 and it was arranged via protein preparation (at pH 7 and the OPLS3e force field) in the Schrodinger Suite 2019-1.24 The protein preparation involves the process of adding hydrogen atoms (PROPKA) and removing unnecessary chains and water molecules, and an OPLS3e force field was applied to minimize the protein structure.2527 The protein molecule underwent a controlled minimization process to refine its geometry, achieving an RMSD of 0.3 Å. | Considerable QSAR studies using PHASE reported the general method consisting of (1) conformer generation with a reasonable number of conformers within available computing resources, (2) building pharmacophore hypothesis with different feature sets and number of points, (3) selection of the best pharmacophore model using scoring functions, and then (4) final building of the 3D-QSAR model using the best pharmacophore model.38 However, the large and heterogeneous data set in this study prevented implementation of the above-mentioned typical process, mainly owing to (1) constraints in conformer ensemble utilization with a large enough number of conformers (e.g., more than 952 inhibitors 100 conformers) and (2) molecular superimposition inconsistencies, which arise either between substituents when bicyclic cores are fixed or between cores when substitution positions are fixed. | Model validation was conducted using 10-fold cross-validation (10-CV), in which 306 compounds were excluded from the training set. | The models were selected based on the criteria of low root-mean-square error (RMSE) and standard deviation (SD) values; RMSE below 0.8 and SD 0.7. 2.5 Out-of-Set Validation of the Optimal QSAR Model The out-of-set molecules consisted of 190 inhibitors and inhibitory activity (IC50) against wild-type RET kinase, which were collected from the patent (US 10,807,986 B2). | 2.6 Application of the Predictive QSAR Model into Virtual Screening The criteria used for filtering the kinase inhibitors, excluding RET inhibitors, were based on characteristics such as SlogP, TPSA, and molecular weight (Table 1). | A total of 459 compounds could be docked against the RET protein following the same configuration as described in Section 2.2. The 3D-QSAR model was then used as a three-dimensional query to distinguish the hits with the highest predicted RET inhibitory activity. | 3 Results 3.1 Activity Prediction of a Broad Range of 5,6-Fused Heteroaromatic Compounds As mentioned in the histories of RET inhibitors above, the selectivity between RET and other receptor tyrosine kinases is important for clinical development, especially in terms of drug resistance. | However, to our best knowledge, there are no reports providing the design logic for discriminating between MKIs and RET-selective inhibitors along with predicted potency. | In this situation, the features of the RET-selective inhibitors can be a good clue to predict them. | Notably, 5,6-fused heteroaromatic rings are frequently observed in both selective RET inhibitors and recently reported patents. | Therefore, we expected that QSAR modeling with these compounds containing 5,6-fused heteroaromatic cores could come closer to the drug design logic (for selectivity and potency). | When we collected RET inhibitors with enzymatic IC50 values from five different data sources (Figure 3), a considerable number of compounds out of the 4763 inhibitors featured 5,6-fused heteroaromatic rings in the substructure analysis using the KNIME workflow. | Furthermore, while typical QSAR models use around 100 data sets with pIC50 values in the range of about 3 (1000-fold gap between the best and worst data), we could acquire a data set that is ten times larger and has an activity range a thousand times wider than them (size: 4763; IC50: 10 mM to 0.1 nM; pIC50 range: 6) as shown in the distribution of RET inhibitory activities as pIC50 values (Figure 4). | Figure 4 Distribution of the pIC50 value of collected RET inhibitors. | In sequence, we could generate 3D conformations21 of the 5,6-fused heteroaromatic compounds and conduct their molecular docking simulations.31 The docking poses resulting from the simulations are approximate to bioactive conformation and also provide the superimposition (3D alignment) of the data set.38 After substructure filtering of the aligned conformers was conducted through the docking simulations, 49 different 5,6-fused bicyclic heteroaromatic rings as substructures could be observed in the RET inhibitors (Supporting Information). | Figure 5 Hierarchical clustering of RET inhibitors and 10 representative ring structures out of 49 substructures. | Very fortunately, the prediction of the subnanomolar (pIC50 9) active compounds was highly precise up to 0.03 pIC50 gap, demonstrating this models capability for picomolar prediction. | When we conducted docking simulations, 30 inhibitors out of 170 patent compounds satisfied the reliable docking poses with hydrogen bonding to ALA807 of the RET hinge region. | The pIC50 values of the inhibitors were predicted using the optimal QSAR model to evaluate the practical utility of the model (see also the values in the Supporting Information). | Clearly, their inhibitory activities presented a reasonable difference between actual and predicted activity values in the scatter plot of Figure6. | Furthermore, the residual plot demonstrated rare outliers beyond the cutoff range (2.0 2.0) of acceptable prediction.42 Figure 7 Residual analysis of patent-filed RET inhibitors as out-of-set data. | Therefore, we tried to analyze the 3D molecular interaction features through the visualization of three representative inhibitors chosen from both the active (pIC50 9) and inactive (pIC50 close to 34) groups in Table 4. | The feature distinctions between active and inactive compounds were analyzed using contour maps (a form of a 3D feature map) of the optimal QSAR model. | First of all, the critical hydrogen bond of RET inhibitors with the hinge region (Glu805 and Ala807) was perfectly matched between the 3D location of the H-donor feature with a positive coefficient (blue box) and the docking pose of the most potent compound (Figure 8a). | Even if both the most potent and the least potent compounds commonly have hydrogen bonds (H-bond), the H-donor feature discriminated between their subtle locations, leading to a mismatch between the H-donor feature and the H-bond in the least potent compound (Figure 8b). | Despite the presence of aromatic amino groups in the inactive compound (44, 46, and 83), they did not align with the H-donor feature at the same location (Figure 8b). | This subtle difference in the location of the H-donor suggests a conducive principle in the design of highly active RET inhibitors. | In feature analysis, the functional group at the C3 position was another important feature to discriminate between active and inactive compounds. | (A) Representative active compound 377 (cyan) and (B) inactive compound 44 (red). | This implies that the incorporation of a hydrophobic group at the N1 and C2 positions is recommended in the RET inhibitor design. | Clearly, while the most inactive molecules lacked substituents to the N1 or C2 positions (Figure 9b), the most potent RET inhibitors have isopropyl (molecules 591 and 371) or 1-methylcyclopropyl (molecule 377) along with the alkynyl group at the C2 position (Figure 9a). | Additionally, incorporating an amino group at the C4 position is recommended for highly potent RET inhibitors in terms of hydrophobic feature (negative coefficient) as well as the above H-donor (positive coefficient). | (A) Representative active compound 377 (cyan) and (B) inactive compound 44 (red). | It indicates that the EW feature in the hinge binder region has a weak ability to discriminate the RET inhibitory activity. | (A) Representative active compound 377 (cyan) and (B) inactive compound 44 (red). | For this purpose, we examined docking poses of patent-filed RET inhibitors as out-of-set. | The reverse orientation of the core structure (5,6-fused bicyclic heteroaromatic ring) in compounds 104 and 133 (outlier group) compared to compounds 14 and 106 (normal group) significantly influenced the positioning of substituents at C2, C3, C4, and N1 (Figure 11). | Figure 11 Pose comparison of out-of-set molecules from patent-filed RET inhibitors. | Outlier group molecules include (A) compound 104p and (B) compound 133p and normal group molecules include (C) compound 14p and (D) compound 106p. | Therefore, 3D-QSAR models, which rely on the alignment of the inhibitors from docking results, can explain the conflicting behaviors of QSAR feature cubes surrounding active and inactive compounds despite identical substituents. | For instance, in the contour map of compound 104, the alkynyl group was matched with the negative EWG feature (electron donating) and the hydroxyl group was well matched with the positive EWG features. | Notably, the presence of an isopropyl group at N1 in compound 104 was regarded as unfavorable (depicted by the negative hydrophobic), in contrast to its favorable depiction in compound 14 (Figure 12). | Figure 12 Whole feature analysis of representative out-of-set from patent-filed RET inhibitors. | (A) EW interaction feature of compound 104p, (B) hydrophobicnonpolar interaction feature of compound 104p, (C) EW interaction feature of compound 14p, and (D) hydrophobicnonpolar interaction feature of compound 14p. | The overall view in Figure 13 simplifies the SAR for designing RET inhibitors based on the comparative analysis of every contour map. | The N-substituted amide at the C3 position was commonly observed in active compounds, and hence we named the C3 substituent as a linker, such as reported in another study.43 Figure 13 Summarized and simplified feature analysis for designing RET inhibitors. | 4.2 The QSAR Model Applied to the Off-Target Screening of Clinical and Nonclinical Kinase Inhibitors The reliable evaluation and interpretation of the optimal QSAR model encouraged us to apply the QSAR model to an off-target screening for RET alteration in known clinical and nonclinical kinase inhibitors. | Among 633 drug candidates collected from PKIDB38 and MRC,39 459 kinase inhibitors were docked to RET kinase to produce 3D conformation for QSAR prediction. | After achieving both docking scores and predicted pIC50 values, the top 30 inhibitors were selected under two different ranking methods. | Surprisingly, seven compounds in the chosen top 30 list were acknowledged for their inhibitory efficacy against RET in the literature (Table 5). | In the first announced patent, Edralbrutinib, Evobrutinib, and Pirtobrutinib are patented as BTK inhibitors;44 Sapanisertib functions as an mTOR inhibitor;45 Abivertinib serves as an EGFR inhibitor;46 Atinvicitinib acts as a JAK inhibitor;47 and Laduviglusib (also known as CHIR-99021) is an inhibitor of GSK3β signaling.48 Despite the absence of a core structure commonly found in active molecules, according to the QSAR model, the molecule contained an imidazole moiety. | 5 Conclusions In conclusion, the primary objective of this study was to examine the relationship between ligand structures and inhibitory activity using 3D-QSAR modeling. | The optimal 3D-QSAR model was developed using RET kinase inhibitors with 49 different substructures to demonstrate a high predictive performance (R2 value of 0.801 and Q2 value of 0.794). | Finally, the model was applied to screen kinase inhibitors to evaluate their potential applications. | Future work will extend this study by validating outcomes through experimental studies and assessing the drug developability of the identified compounds.","R (MISC), 3D (MISC), R (MISC), NSCLC (MISC)"

for the Selective O-GlcNAcase Inhibitor Thiamet-G,"OGA inhibitors have proven critically useful as tools to help understand the roles of O-GlcNAc, yet accessing large quantities of inhibitors necessary for many animal studies remains a challenge. | Herein is described a scalable method to produce Thiamet-G, a potent, selective, and widely used brain-permeable OGA inhibitor. | O-GlcNAc is installed by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and removed by O-GlcNAcase (OGA), a family 84 glycoside hydrolase (GH84.)12 One important and widely used class of chemical tools for studying this relationship are potent and selective inhibitors of OGA, which can be used to increase levels of cellular O-GlcNAcylation in different model systems. | Accordingly, both academic and industrial teams have worked to develop potent and selective OGA inhibitors to study the physiological function of OGA in animal models of neurodegeneration toward the development of potential therapeutics. | While several OGA inhibitors have been reported, including some from industry derived high-throughput screening medicinal chemistry optimization campaigns (Figure 1) such as MK-8719,13 ASN90,14 and LY3372689,15 the compound that has seen the widest use is Thiamet-G. | Figure 1 Competitive OGA inhibitors MK-8719 (left), ASN90 (center), and LY3372689 (right). | The design of Thiamet-G was inspired by mechanistic studies of the OGA enzyme showing the enzyme uses a two-step reaction involving an oxazoline intermediate.16 These mechanistic insights led to the preparation of the transition state analog Thiamet-G, which is one of the most potent (Ki 2.1 nM) and selective (37,000 fold selectivity hOGA over β-hexosaminidase17) compounds currently reported. | The importance of hOGA selectivity was highlighted by the problematic off-target effects observed in the first reported inhibitors that inadvertently also targeted β-hexosaminidase.18 As an hOGA inhibitor, Thiamet-G is orally bioavailable, permeates into the brain, and has accordingly been used to study in vivo O-GlcNAcylation and its role in the pathology of inflammation,19 cardiovascular disease,20,21 cancers,4,6 stroke,22 AD,7,9,23 PD,16,24 Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP),25 and Huntingtons Disease (HD).26 However, due to the modest permeability of Thiamet-G, coupled with extended dosing needed in transgenic animal studies of neurodegenerative diseases, these studies often require large quantities of Thiamet-G for chronic long-term dosing administered via drinking water (100 mg kg1 day1).9,16,23,25,2729 The requirement for large amounts of material limits the feasibility of these studies within academic settings. | Unfortunately, the current synthetic route for Thiamet-G is unsuitable for preparing large quantities in academic laboratories due to its reliance on toxic heavy metals and column chromatography.16 Furthermore, MK-8719 and many analogs of Thiamet-G use this compound as an advanced intermediate, making improved routes to Thiamet-G of value. | Thiamet-G has also found use in inhibitor cross-competition enzyme kinetics studies to orthogonally validate the binding site for other OGA targeting molecules, including ASN90.14 As such, there is a need for a more accessible and straightforward synthetic route to Thiamet-G to support this field of research. | With compound 4 in hand, the next aim was to scale up the installation and subsequent cyclization of the C-2 ethyl thiourea group. | Employing the previously published conditions (Figure 2B) of triethylamine and ethyl isothiocyanate refluxed in acetonitrile failed to reproduce the reported 98 yield16 of thiourea containing compound 5. | Trifluoroacetic acid has previously been shown as an effective cyclization reagent for the synthesis of thiazolines at room temperature.32 Using just 1.2 equiv of trifluoroacetic acid at room temperature, efficient cyclization of compound 5 was observed, with the resulting crude compound 6 being of sufficient purity to move forward into subsequent reactions. | The resulting mixture was stirred at 0 C for 1 h and the precipitate was collected by a 4 L Buchner funnel suction filtration, washed successively with cold water (9.5 L), cold ethanol (9.5 L) and diethyl ether (9.5 L), and then dried under vacuum to give the title compound as a white solid. | The precipitate was collected by 4 L Buchner funnel suction filtration, washed with 4.0 L of ice water and dried under vacuum to give the title compound as a white solid (943 g, 86 yield). | The precipitate was collected via 4 L Buchner funnel suction filtration, washed twice with 4.0 L of cold diethyl ether and dried under vacuum to give the title compound as a white solid (885 g, 99 yield).","N (MISC), G (MISC), O (MISC), O (MISC), G (MISC), Thiamet - G (MISC), O (MISC), Thiamet - G (MISC), N (MISC), G (MISC), Alzheimers Disease (MISC), AD (MISC), Parkinsons Disease (MISC), PD (MISC), G (MISC), G (MISC)"

11656587.xml,Advances in genetically modified neural stem cell therapy for central nervous system injury and neurological diseases,"Furthermore, genetic modification empowers NSCs to play a more robust neuroprotective role in the context of nerve injury. | This deterioration is characterized by a reduction in the secretion of neurotrophic factors, the formation of glial scars, and the presence of inhibitors of neuronal regeneration . | Although NSCs possess the capacity to augment neuroregeneration and promote the restoration of neurological functions through a variety of mechanisms, their low long-term survival, neural differentiation and integration within the host injured nervous system diminish the functional benefits of NSC-based therapies for SCI, attributable to the hostile and progressively deteriorating microenvironment resulting from various unfavorable factors subsequent to nerve injuries . | In comparison, an increasing body of evidence indicates that a series of neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT3), among others, can effectively promote neural differentiation, survival, synaptic plasticity, and regeneration . | Intriguingly, NSCs can be strategically engineered via genetic modification to stably express specific biological molecules, including neurotrophic factors , anti-apoptotic genes , and antioxidant enzymes , over extended durations. | Concurrently, numerous studies have shown that NSCs are capable of secreting a diverse array of products, including neurotrophic and other bioactive factors, which ameliorate the adverse microenvironment . | Genetically modified NSCs serve as ideal carriers for specific molecules, maximizing the potential of cell therapy and yielding higher levels of therapeutic efficiency through a variety of mechanisms Genetically modified NSCs Despite extensive research demonstrating that transplanted NSCs confer therapeutic benefits not only by replenishing damaged or necrotic cells but also through bystander immunomodulatory and neurotrophic mechanisms, their clinical application remains significantly challenged. | Compelling studies have evidenced that several neurotrophins and bioactive factors can play a neuroprotective role by improving the microenvironment, triggering nerve repair and regeneration . | Promoted neuronal survival, neurite growth, and NF200 immunoreactivity in TBI lesion regionGDNFC17.2 NSC cell lineRat TBI24

genetic modification produce high amounts of neurotrophic substances, which are capable of improving the NSCs survival and neuronal differentiation, and aiding in lost cellular population replacement . | More importantly, NSCs have been observed to facilitate functional recovery in TBI by secreting neurotrophic factors , increasing the expression of synaptic proteins , and differentiating into functional neurons. | Notably, the majority of these graft-derived neurons were characterized as interneurons expressing the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) . | Similarly, another study also demonstrated that rats receiving transplants of NSCs overexpressing BDNF exhibited an increased number of NF200-positive cells, and surviving NF200-positive cells have larger cell bodies and longer axons as compared with NSCs-transplanted rats, indicating improvement of neuronal survival and differentiation . | These findings suggest that NSCs genetically modified to overexpress BDNF may play a crucial role in promoting neural differentiation, neuronal survival, and axonal regeneration. | This is attributed to an increase in growth-inhibitory factors and a decrease in growth-promoting factors within nervous tissues . | Furthermore, the relatively low differentiation rates of neurons and oligodendrocytes present a challenge for NSCs to effectively exert neuroprotective effects. | These glial scars serve as both biochemical and physical barriers to axonal regeneration, and produce inhibitory factors that impede nerve regeneration. | In recent years, the transplantation of NSCs has emerged as a promising neurorestorative approach for ischemic stroke, and confer beneficial effects not only by providing structural replacement but also through mechanisms such as neurotrophic support, immunomodulation, and vascular repair . | Genetically engineered NSCs offer potential neuroprotection against ischemic stroke. | This includes alterations in synaptic activity, interhemispheric connectivity, the secretion of neurotrophic factors, and the consequent disturbance of normal neural circuits . | Current therapeutic approaches for the recanalization of acute ischemic stroke primarily encompass intravenous administration of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and endovascular interventions . | Neurotrophic and growth-promoting factors are crucial for neuroprotection and neural regeneration. | To address the adverse microenvironment following hemorrhagic stroke, the overexpression of neurotrophic factors such as BDNF, VEGF, GDNF, and various growth factors, along with survival signaling molecules in transplanted NSCs, has been shown to effectively ameliorate the hostile conditions, thereby promoting cell survival and neural regeneration . | Furthermore, genetic modification has been shown to augment the neuronal differentiation of NSCs, thereby exerting neuroprotective effects in the context of hemorrhagic stroke. | It is significant to highlight that genetically modified NSCs confer neuroprotective effects via various mechanisms, particularly through anti-apoptotic pathways. | These changes, coupled with cell survival-promoting molecules, are observed in the ICH brain as a result of the overexpression of neurotrophic factors in transplanted NSCs . | Despite the inherent challenges associated with gene transduction therapy in NSCs, its unique advantages and promising potential have garnered significant attention from researchers in the field of neuroregeneration.","N (MISC), CNS (MISC), N (MISC),

Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer Contrast
Agents and Nanocarriers for Imaging Proton Exchange in Vivo,"Chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging (CEST MRI) enables the imaging of many endogenous and exogenous compounds with exchangeable protons and protons experiencing dipolar coupling by using a label-free approach. | The coupled protons undergo cross-relaxation, where the saturation is transferred to bulk water.16 Chemical exchange and cross-relaxation could be major components of the relaxation mechanism in biological tissue in magnetization transfer experiments in vivo, and the exchange between water and a series of metabolites and exogenous diamagnetic compounds could then be measured by CEST.15,17 With the repeated saturation transfer, this saturation effect will be detected as the reduction of bulk water signal over a series of offset frequency at steady state, hence the name Z-spectrum (Figure 1A (ii-iii)).18 Notably, the water resonance frequency is at 0 ppm in CEST experiments, in contrast to that at 4.7 ppm in NMR. | While in CEST experiments (Figure 1B (ii-iii)), by measuring the water signal, hydroxyl protons of glycogen were readily detected.18 Given its contrast mechanism, CEST is well-suited for label-free detection of a wide range of endogenous and exogenous compounds where the labile protons such as hydroxyl, amine, and amide protons are exchanging at a slow-to-intermediate rate on an NMR time scale.18 Figure 1 CEST and its relation to 1H NMR. | In addition to the rNOE signals observed in proteins that are assigned to the side chains, rNOE has been observed in organized structures such as cell membranes and liposomes, presumably originated from the choline component or the aliphatic protons of lipid molecules.35,36 Many studies have been devoted to developing fast and accurate acquisition and post-processing methods for decoupling other confounding effects in vivo CEST signals and extracting essential information for diagnosis and treatment evaluation.3739 Exogenous CEST detectable compounds are widely exploited as CEST contrast agents (CEST CAs), further aiding disease diagnosis and treatment monitoring. | For example, Sinharay et al.83 synthesized a compound with a cleavable sulfate group that masks the salicylic acid moiety from producing CEST signal. | The study on phenolic compounds serves as a good example of how phenol-based analogs with different chemical structures can have drastically different offset frequencies and kex due to different stereoelectronic effects experienced by exchangeable protons (Figure 2A-B).95 Moreover, intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonding also modulate kex. | For example, hydroxyl protons have an exchange rate at about 2300 s1 at pH 7.3, which belongs to the fast exchange regime and could have attenuated CEST signal at physiological pH, but enhanced contrast at acidic tumor microenvironment due to reduced kex.97,98 A thymidine-based compound is used as a CEST imaging probe for herpes simplex virus type-1 thymidine kinase, where optimal kex for the CEST CA was obtained when the pKa increased.99 Mapping pH in vivo could be performed using clinical iodinated CT agents

11657192.xml,Insights and progress on the biosynthesis, metabolism, and physiological functions of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA): a review,"Finally, we discuss the development of ligands for the GABA receptor binding site, the prospects of GABA production and application, as well as its clinical trials in potential drugs or compounds targeting GABA for the treatment of epilepsy. | As an inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA is most widely distributed in the central nervous system in mammals, but it is also expressed in small amounts in many peripheral tissues (e.g., liver, kidney, stomach, small intestine, and reproductive organs). | GABA is considered one of the inhibitory neurotransmitters involved in a variety of metabolic activities, such as depression, anxiety and stress management, hypertension, diabetes, cancer activity, oxidative, inflammatory, microbial, and allergic resistance, and protection of the liver, kidney, and intestine. | New clinical trials targeting GABA for the treatment of epilepsy are briefly discussed, along with a detailed examination of potentially effective drugs or compounds targeting GABA for epilepsy treatment. | On this basis, this review also discusses in depth potential drugs or compounds that target GABA, using epilepsy as an example. | In 1961, Curtis, Phillis Watkins (1961) found that GABA had an inhibitory effect on spinal cord neurons, providing further evidence for GABAs function as a neurotransmitter. | GABA can react with ninhydrin to form a purple compound, which has a maximum absorption at 570 nm. | At the center of this channel is a pore permeable to chloride ions; the GABAA receptor exerts an inhibitory effect in the central nervous system by modulating the cell membranes depolarization. | GABAB receptors not only mediate the actions of major inhibitory neurotransmitters but also associate with neurological and gastrointestinal disorders, as well as mental health issues. | The GABAC ρ1 subunit not only plays an important role in inhibitory pathways and sensory processing in the retina and spinal cord but also acts as an inhibitory modulator in olfactory bulb neurons, affecting olfactory signaling processes (Chen et al., 2007). | At the same time, excessive intake of GABA (as a neurotrophic substance) by insects can also affect their growth and development (Kiep et al., 2015). | Effects of GABA on physiological functions in mammals GABA, as a major inhibitory neurotransmitter, has effects that extend beyond suppressing anxiety, relieving depression, and providing sedation and sleep aid. | Regulating the nervous system As a major inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA can effectively alleviate or directly suppress anxiety by blocking the reception of anxiety-related information in the central nervous system and binding to anxiety-reducing receptors in the brain (Jiang et al., 2020). | In mature neurons, GABA primarily serves an inhibitory role. | Systemic administration of the gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter-1 inhibitor NO-711 is prophylactic and therapeutic for paclitaxel-induced thermal nociceptive hypersensitivity and cold allodynia in some patients with dose-limiting painful peripheral neuropathy caused by paclitaxel during cancer treatment (Masocha Parvathy, 2016). | Although GABA shows potential inhibitory effects on cancer, most of these results are derived from in vitro cellular and animal experiments, and its actual effects on humans still need to be confirmed by further clinical studies. | Neuronal proteomic studies in young and aging animals revealed that the channel protein TMC-1 achieves its anti-aging function by regulating GABA signaling, and the TMC-1-GABA-PKC signaling axis is neuroprotective under aging and disease conditions (Wu et al., 2022). | A therapeutic serum containing GABA and a variety of peptides with neurotransmitter inhibitory and cell signaling properties has been shown to be capable of improving the appearance of expression lines under the eyes and on the face, including crows feet and forehead lines (Draelos, Kononov Fox, 2016). | As the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system, GABA is present in approximately 2550 of mammalian neurons (Miri et al., 2023). | There are many potential possible drugs or compounds that could target GABA for the treatment of epilepsy. | GABAA receptors play a key role in inhibitory neurotransmission; therefore, drugs targeting GABAA receptors have received extensive research attentions in the treatment of epilepsy. | By enhancing the inhibitory effects of GABA, these drugs can reduce neuronal excitability and exert an antiepileptic effect. | Phenobarbital effectively prolongs the opening time of the chloride channel by acting on the GABAA receptor, significantly enhancing the inhibitory effect of GABA. | In addition to research on drugs targeting the GABAA receptor for the prevention and treatment of epilepsy, research is actively underway on a wide range of drugs or compounds targeting the GABAA, GABAB and GABAC receptors for the prevention and treatment of a variety of disorders, such as Parkinsons disease, muscle spasms, depression and others.","GA (MISC), L (MISC), GA (MISC), GA (MISC), GA (MISC), ##C (ORG), GA (MISC), GA (MISC), GA (MISC), GA (MISC), GA (MISC), GA (MISC), GA (MISC), GA (MISC)"

Dynamics of intermolecular hydrogen bonding In addition to intramolecular hydrogen bonds, the time evolution of intermolecular hydrogen bonding was evaluated to explore the stability of the docked CatB with Lurasidone, Paliperidone, and Ca-074Me. The presence of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the protein and small molecules governs the formation of stable docked complexes . | When comparing with the reference inhibitor Ca-074Me, it showed 17 hydrogen bonds with CatB, with a higher stability of 13 bonds (Fig 6C, upper panel). | Among the studied compounds, Paliperidone had the most favorable binding energy at 38.82 kJmol, which indicates that it interacts most favorably with CatB. | Based on these results, Paliperidone and Lurasidone can be considered as potential inhibitor candidates with high binding affinity towards CatB. | The congruency of these results with other simulation analyses lends credibility to our findings and the prospect of these compounds as CatB inhibitors. | Additional experimental work would be required to substantiate the observed inhibitory properties of these compounds on CatB activity. | Both compounds demonstrated high binding affinities to functionally relevant residues in the CatB catalytic pocket, supporting their selectivity and therapeutic potential. | Structural stability observed during MD simulations, along with insights from PCA and FEL analyses, further validated their potential as CatB inhibitors. | Despite these limitations, Lurasidone and Paliperidone provide a strong foundation for repurposing as lead compounds for AD and cancer therapies. | Supporting information S1 Fig Chemical structures of CA-074Me, E-64, and selected synthesized molecules as CatB inhibitors. | (DOCX) S2 Fig Re-docking of a co-crystalized dipeptidyl nitrile inhibitor of CatB showing superimposition to each other.","Alzheimers (MISC), AD (MISC), A (MISC), Cathe (MISC), B (MISC), CatB (MISC), anti (MISC), Alzheimers (MISC), AD (MISC), CatB (MISC), CatB (MISC), DrugBank (ORG), CatB (MISC), CatB (MISC), Lu (MISC), Pa (ORG), ##don (MISC), CatB (MISC), Cat (MISC), CatB (MISC), Cat (MISC), Lu (ORG), Pa (ORG), Lu (MISC), Pa (ORG), CatB (MISC), AD (MISC), CatB (MISC), Alzheimers (MISC), AD (MISC), AD (MISC)"

11658958.xml,Pharmacological Mechanisms of Cryptotanshinone: Recent Advances in Cardiovascular, Cancer, and Neurological Disease Applications,"Given its superior efficacy, modern medicine utilizes it to treat a range of diseases, including liver diseases and tumors.3 To date, numerous chemical compounds have been extracted from the Salvia miltiorrhiza. | In addition to their efficacy in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, danshen preparations have been demonstrated to improve the prognosis of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.35,36 Furthermore, danshen preparations are utilized in conjunction with other proprietary Chinese medicines for the management of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and alcoholic fatty liver disease.3739 Furthermore, a review of the existing literature revealed that, while there are currently no clinical trials investigating CTS, tanshinone IIA, which shares a similar structural composition with CTS, has been approved for use as a proprietary drug (tanshinone IIA sodium sulfonate) and has already been the subject of several clinical trials.40 A comparison of cryptotanshinone with tanshinone IIA indicates that both belong to the group of chemical compounds known as diterpene quinones, and that they are similarly characterized by low bioavailability. | For instance, CTS causes apoptosis by regulating the PI3KAktNF-κB signaling pathway and amending the expression of Bax and Bcl-2.81 It can also restrict the G0G1 cell cycle and induce apoptosis in non-small cell lung cancer cells by means of the PI3KAktGSK3β pathway.82 Furthermore, research indicates that CTS may act as a potential inhibitor of SIRT3, which has been demonstrated to impede colorectal cancer proliferation by targeting SIRT3 proteins and arresting the cell cycle in the S phase.83 The STAT family of transcription activators play a significant role in the proliferation, apoptosis, and regulation of the tumor microenvironment. | Hence, they are considered an effective anti-cancer target.84 CTS functions as an efficient STAT3 inhibitor, and combination of CTS with paclitaxel is able to suppress tumor cell growth through JAKSTAT3 signaling pathway suppression and promote apoptosis.85 Whats more, research has shown that CTS induce renal carcinoma cell and gastric cancer cell apoptosis by inhibiting the JAKSTAT3 pathway and suppressing proliferation.86,87 In addition to effectively inhibiting STAT3 expression, CTS may also exert an anticancer effect by inhibiting other members of the STAT family, such as STAT1 and STAT5.88 In addition to its known mechanisms of action, CTS has been found to also impede cancer cell proliferation through alternative molecular targets or pathways. | First, CTS activates the AMPKTSC2 axis to suppress downstream protein mTORC1 signal transduction, thus hindering cancer cell growth.78 Second, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) is be capable of stimulating continuous cell proliferation,89 and CTS acts as a novel CDK4 inhibitor by down-regulating the expression of mutant oncogene Kras to block the transition of cells from G0G1 phase to S phase, thereby inhibiting cancer cell growth.47 Whats more, studies have demonstrated that CTS may target TAZ downstream of Hippo, attenuating the stemness of NSCLC by translocating from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.90 Suppression of Invasion and Metastasis Angiogenesis during cancer metastasis is closely related to the recruitment of metalloproteinases (MMP family),91 and CTS decreases MMP expression and increases metallopeptidase (TIMP) expression to inhibit invasion and metastasis in colon and non-small cell lung cancers.9294 During angiogenesis, EMT activation converts epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells, which is produced by N-cadherin or E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell interactions,91 and CTS downregulates the mTORβ-cateninN-cadherin signaling pathway and reduces N-cadherin expression thereby inhibiting bladder cancer cell invasion and metastasis.95 In addition, focal adhesion kinases (FAK) are a class of non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) in the cytoplasm that promote invasion and metastasis of cancer cells,96 and CTS downregulates FAK and C-myc transcription to inhibit ovarian cancer cell metastasis.97 Inducing Autophagy Autophagy is a biological process in which lysosomes degrade their own proteins and organelles under the regulation of ATG genes,98 and autophagy is able to inhibit tumor growth to promote tumor apoptosis and has an inhibitory effect on tumor development to some extent.99 On the one hand, CTS has the ability to regulate the Atg5 gene in cancer cells, enhance the expression of Beclin-1 and LC3-II, and trigger autophagy in cancer cells via the traditional Beclin-1 signaling route.75,100 On the other hand, CTS promotes autophagy in HCT116 colon cancer cells by enhancing endoplasmic reticulum stress, which later affects downstream BadBcl-2 expression to promote apoptosis.101 Given that CTS inhibits P-gp mediated efflux93 and its antitumor activity, CTS induces ROS production, promotes cellular autophagy and leads to cancer cell death in multi-drug resistant colon cancer.102 Promoting Apoptosis Apoptosis is the process of programmed cell death that occurs in organisms under physiological or pathological conditions.103 Imbalances in the regulation of cell proliferation and death are central to cancer development, where DNA damage and external signaling can trigger apoptosis.104 CTS is an active herbal substance with great potential for fighting cancer, as it upregulates the BaxBcl-2 ratio through multiple signaling pathways such as JNKp38, PI3KAkt, JAKSTAT3, and NF-κB, overexpresses Caspase family proteins, and induces apoptosis in various types of cancer cells, including gastric cancer,105 liver cancer,74 colon cancer,93 and cholangiocarcinoma.81 The transcription factor p53 is upstream of the apoptotic signaling pathway, and it targets the PUMA promoter region to promote apoptosis.74 CTS not only upregulates p53 gene expression for apoptosis induction,106 but also increases PUMA protein expression to further exert a potent anticancer effect.107 Additionally, CTS induces necroptosis by increasing Caspase-3 protein levels via the JNKp38 pathway in gastric cancer cell lines, and activates the RIP1RIP3MLKL pathway for Ca2 and ROS-overexpression induced necroptosis in NSCLC cells.108 Immunomodulation Tumor immunotherapy is an emerging therapy that activates the specific response of the bodys immune system to fight tumors.109 Based on the therapeutic principles of tumor immunotherapy, numerous bioactive compounds derived from plant sources have shown remarkable anti-tumor efficacy.110 CTS has significant anti-cancer potential and acts on multiple pathways in the human immune system to achieve therapeutic effects. | For instance, when CTS is used in conjunction with the immune checkpoint inhibitor PD-L1, it enhances specific immune responses and memory responses.116 Reducing Drug Resistance Drug resistance in tumor cells is a significant cause of tumor treatment failure. | The mechanisms behind this include the efflux of drugs by transporter pumps, expression of proto-oncogenes or oncogenes, DNA repair, and tumor stem cells.117 The etiology of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) is associated with the generation of BCR-ABL fusion genes, which could be a target for the treatment of chronic granulocytic leukemia.118 CTS could act as an inhibitor of STAT5 or STAT3 (BCR-ABL downstream protein) to downregulate C-myc in CML and reverse BCR-ABL kinase non-dependent drug resistance.88 To enhance the sensitivity of anticancer drugs, several therapeutic approaches are used with CTS. | For example, CTS inhibits ATP production in ovarian cancer cells, induces activation of AMPK, which controls the energy reduction process, and inhibits glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS),123 Further studies showed that both AMPK inhibitors and silencing AMPK could partially reverse the therapeutic effects of CTS.124 In addition, in hepatocellular carcinoma, STAT3 may regulate glycolysis through the HK2 pathway.127 Further studies have revealed that STAT3 inhibits the transcriptional activity of downstream SIRT3 to regulate glycolysis and proliferation in breast cancer cells.128 In addition, PKM2, which is a rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis, is downregulated by CTS to inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of breast cancer cells through the PKM2β-Catenin pathway.129 Summarily, CTS also showed promising potential in the treatment of cancers with the effect mechanism via multiple targets and pathways (Figure 4 and Table 2). | These derivatives had anti-neuroinflammatory effects by inhibiting the TLR 4 mediated MAPK signaling pathway and had higher bioavailability and stronger bioactivity in comparison to CTS.69 It is worth mentioning that in recent years a combination of computerized virtual screening and scientific experiments have been favored, such as simulating the binding of CTS and AD disease proteins and finding potential molecular targets on the basis of which the scientific hypothesis was validated by cellular and animal experiments.132,134 This provides viable ideas for finding potential targets for small molecule drugs against the disease. | It relieves oxaliplatin induced nerve pain149 and alleviates monosodium urate induced neuropathic pain150 while inhibiting the chronic constrictive injury induced postoperative neuropathic pain and its inflammatory progression in rats by suppressing the PI3KAkt signaling pathway.145 Furthermore, CTS exhibits neuroprotective effects, including inhibition of Aβ aggregation and cerebrovascular endothelial cell inflammatory responses to counteract vascular dementia (VD),151 and promotion of neuronal growth and memory improvement via the extracellular ERK12 signaling pathway.152,153 Digestive System Protection Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a chronic and recurrent inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract.154 One potential treatment for IBD is CTS, which has shown promising results in animal models of the disease. | Table 3Disease and Mechanisms of the Major Action of CTSAuthor and YearDiseasesMechanismEffectsZhao et al 2022108Non-small

against various enteroviruses (EVs) in clinical trials. | However, these compounds encountered issues with resistance and adverse effects, which impeded their approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). | The activation of TREM1 by EVD68 depends on NFκB p65, as shown by inhibition studies using NFκB p65 inhibitors and siRNA. | Blocking the TREM1 pathway with an LP17 inhibitor also reduced the activation of the p38 MAPK pathway, indicating the significant role of TREM1 in activating p38 MAPK through phosphorylation . | Pleconaril, pocapavir, pirodavir, and vapendavir are WINlike compounds occupying the hydrophobic pocket in the canyon of VP1, as shown in Table 1 . | This study signifies distinct mechanisms imposed by drugs with different EVD68 strains Pleconaril analogs with substitutions at isoxazole and phenyl ring VP1 in vitro Pleconarilresistant enteroviruses efficiently inhibited pleconarilsusceptible enteroviruses within the micromolar range (IC50 0.025.25 μM) Pleconaril analogs with substitutions at isoxazole and phenyl ring VP1 in vitro Pleconarilresistant EVs combination either with nucleotide polymerase inhibitor or 2C inhibitor delayed the

activity against various EVD68 strains were discovered. | Furthermore, telaprevir provided neuroprotective effects on motor neurons and resulted in improved limb paralysis outcomes, extending beyond the site of viral inoculation. | R523062 2CPro in vitro EVD68 R523062, a 2C inhibitor, is highly effective against contemporary strains of EVD68. | Rupintrivir 2CPro in vitro EVD68 Rupintrivir, a

substance with significant activity against EVD68. | Vapendavir, a capsid inhibitor, significantly improved asthma exacerbation caused by HRV . | However, a study has shown the effectiveness of two capsid inhibitors, including pocapavir and vapendavir, revealed their lack of efficacy against three strains of EVD68 identified during the 2014 outbreak (MO18947, USAMO18949 and USAIL18956). |

| Molecular docking and reverse genetics analyses revealed an overlapping binding site between R856932 and pleconaril, highlighting the compounds mechanism and potential resistance pathways . | Analysis of the structureactivity relationship (SAR) and the VP1 proteins structural biology led to identifying compounds with significant in vitro antiviral activity, including broadspectrum efficacy against various EVD68 strains (prototype and contemporary). | The leading compound, 19, demonstrated superior broadspectrum antiviral activity attributed to the 1,2,4oxadiazole group facilitating binding to EVD68 VP1s hydrophobic pocket. | Moreover, antiviral studies of compound17 and its analogs have shown significant potential against EVB, EVC, EVD, and rhinovirus A and B . | Fluoxetine, a

for the Treatment of EVD68 Infection There are no approved therapies for EVD68, although several compounds have shown in vitro efficacy, including Rupintrivir, Enviroxime, and Pleconaril . | A recent study explored the structureactivity relationships of a compound targeting the 2C protein of EVD68, EVA71, and coxsackievirus (CV)A24v. | This compound, structurally similar to the FDAapproved fluoxetine, exhibits better chemical properties. | Several novel inhibitors with broadspectrum efficacy against EV and RV were identified, revealing a shared druggable binding site on their 2C

a compound extracted from Pseudolarix kaempferi Gordon, is predominantly utilized in managing dermatological conditions . | These findings suggest compounds inducing G2M phase arrest, like pseudolaric acid B, oridonin, and erianin, could be promising in treating EVD68related diseases, highlighting the need for further investigation into Chinese medicinal herbs for potential therapeutic applications . | The efficacy of avoenin against prototype EVD68 was evaluated, revealing an EC50 of 2.0 μM, approximately ten times less potent than the capsid inhibitor pleconaril, which has an EC50 of 0.23 μM. | Despite the EC50 of avoenin not being particularly low compared to other capsidtargeting enterovirus inhibitors operating in the nanomolar range, the study signifies the identification of avoenin from avocado as a compound with considerable antiEVD68 activity . | However, Pleconaril and other capsid inhibitors failed to show potent antiviral activity against other EVs and developed resistance and unwanted side effects in the clinical setting; therefore, they could not attain approval from the FDA. | The leading compound, 19, distinguished itself through its broadspectrum efficacy and strong in vitro performance, attributed to its enhanced interaction with the EVD68 VP1 protein. | Further research into these compounds bioavailability and metabolic stability could pave the way for new therapeutic strategies against EVD68 infections . | Protease inhibitors (PI) have been evaluated against multiple EVD68 strains. | Although located significantly distant from the inhibitors binding site, this mutation indirectly affects rupintrivirs binding efficiency through subtle structural modifications rather than direct interactions. | Exploring herbal compounds and their active components, particularly those derived from TCHM, has shed light on their potential as effective and affordable treatments against viral infections. | These findings highlight the need for further research into these compounds as potential treatments for EVD68related diseases . | Despite setbacks with traditional antivirals such as pleconaril, promising developments in novel quinoline derivatives, protease inhibitors, and the exploration of herbal compounds, alongside the potential use of hIVIG, offer new paths forward. | Future research should focus on the rational design of inhibitors and further evaluation of combination therapies, potentially broadening our arsenal against not only EVD68 but also other enteroviruses.","ABS (ORG), ##D (MISC), E (MISC), California (LOC),

11659403.xml,Anti-aging properties of the aminosterols of the dogfish shark,"As a consequence, the development of anti-aging compounds based on the rational targeting of specific pathways has fallen short of the goal. | To date, the most impressive compound is rapamycin, a natural bacterial product initially identified as an antifungal, and only subsequently discovered to have anti-aging properties. | This review is the first to gather together published studies conducted both in vitro and in numerous vertebrate species to demonstrate that these compounds target aging pathways at the cellular level and provide benefits in multiple aging-associated conditions in relevant animal models and in humans. | A preferable approach would be the discovery of a single compound that by itself exhibited the desired pharmacodynamic health benefits through synergistic activity across the multiple interconnected networks involved in aging. | Anti-aging compounds In 2002 the National Institute of Aging established a screening program (Interventions Testing Program) to evaluate the effect of treatments on the lifespan of the genetically heterogeneous UM-HET3 mouse stock9. | Nine compounds have been identified to date: aspirin and nordihydroguaiaretic acid10, canagliflozin11, captopril12, glycine13, acarbose and Protandim14, 17α-estradiol15, and rapamycin12,16,17. | Of these, only rapamycin, administered at non-immunosuppressive doses, emerged as the most promising human clinical candidate in large part due to its efficacy in the mouse study in both genders, the overall clinical experience with the compound in organ transplantation, and relatively few adverse side effects at the proposed human doses. | A second compound, metformin, widely used as a first-line treatment for Type 2 diabetes, is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials of life extension based on the results of longevity studies in rodents conducted in several laboratories18. | The discovery of

resultant effects on cellular function, such as ER stress, are well-recognized components of the pathophysiology of the diseases of aging65,72. | PTP1B is a membrane-associated tyrosine phosphatase that plays a major role in the regulation of the activity of many receptor tyrosine kinases that utilize the PI3KAKT pathway, such as insulin and IGF1, and the JAK-Stat pathway, such as the neurotrophins and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). | Trodusquemine is the most extensively studied inhibitor of PTP1B, with a large body of research conducted in animals that appears to support the targeting of PTP1B in different disease states (Table 1). | Since these effects could be observed by either systemic or intra-cerebroventicular administration of much smaller amounts of the compound, we concluded that trodusquemine acted via a central mechanism36,37. | Autoradiographic studies in mice administered tritiated trodusquemine confirmed that the compound accessed the brain and localized to specific areas of the brain, such as the hypothalamus and the arcuate nucleus, which are involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis, diurnal rhythm, and a multitude of other physiological functions. | The compound was administered as an iv infusion over 30 minutes at doses ranging from 330 mgm2. | Attempts to reformulate the compound to permit administration by other routes were not performed, leading to the discontinuation of the development program. | In a parallel experiment, tunicamycin had no effect on arteries from PTP1B knock-out mice, consistent with the PTP1B inhibitory effect of trodusquemine in this model. | The discovery of small molecules that can safely restore regenerative capacity lost during aging would have great therapeutic value in many age-related diseases. | Trodusquemine was discovered to have potent regenerative properties in an unbiased screen of diverse compounds using the zebrafish tail amputation model34. | As yet, no studies of life prolongation by trodusquemine in mice have been published, but we can compare the two compounds with respect to their known effects on the mechanisms underlying aging-associated diseases. | Rapamycin was shown to inhibit fungal growth by targeting an intracellular protein named TOR95; an orthologous protein target, mTOR was shown to be the target of the compound in mammalian cells9698. | Trodusquemine has been shown to effectively reverse rapamycin-induced diabetes, through its inhibitory effects on hepatic gluconeogenesis112. | Conclusion We have shown that trodusquemine targets several major age-related conditions, suggesting that this compound and related aminosterols have the potential to extend the healthy human lifespan. | We favor endogenous compounds with anti-aging properties that have evolved over hundreds of millions of years within the biological context of long-lived animals over man-made compounds targeting single pathways. | Although we naturally think of

Therefore, we designed an assay to precisely measure the GSC invasion into 3D brain organoid tissues and identify compounds that can perturb the GSC invasion. | Although brain organoids hold promise for 3D-organoid-based compound screening, it requires generating a high quantity of organoids with increased homogeneity to arrive at statistically significant results54. | We then aimed to adapt GSC-invading organoids for a drug screening assay to identify compounds inhibiting the GSC invasion in the brain tissue. | Using this setup, we screened compounds that could prevent the neuro-invasion property of GSCs.Fig. | 7Hi-Q brain organoids allow glioma invasion assays and can adapt medium-throughput drug screening assays to identify anti-glioma compounds.A Experimental scheme for a glioma invasion assay using Hi-Q brain organoids that can be adapted for drug screening. | C, D Assay design adapted to screen the compounds preventing GSC invasion. | Two organoids were tested for each compound. | Each box represents a well that is supplied with a compound (D). | E Dot plot shows the selected compounds that prevent GSC invasion into organoids. | The table at the right lists selected ten compounds that can stop the GSCs invasions into brain organoids. | The biological functions of each compound are also listed. | Fulvestrant and Selumtinib significantly prevent GSC invasion into brain organoids as selected compounds. | The bar diagram quantifies the inhibitory effects of the selected compounds on GSC invasion. | We consolidated a library of 180 compounds with known biological targets to design a medium-throughput assay (Supplementary Table 3). | We began the preliminary screening assay in 96-well format by incubating Hi-Q brain organoids and GSCs for 72 h with 5 µM of each compound. | Via this assay, we identified sixteen compounds that negatively affected GSC invasion (Fig. | As a secondary screen, we tested the ability of ten of these sixteen compounds (which exhibited the most inhibitory effect) to perturb GSC invasion at 1 µM concentration. | This analysis identified Selumetinib and Fulvestrant as effective inhibitors of GSC invasion into brain organoids as judged by the differences in the number of GSC foci between twenty-four and seventy-two hours of invasion assay (Supplementary Fig. | Selumetinib is a mitogen-activated protein kinase 1, and 2 inhibitors used to treat neurofibromatosis56. | We then tested whether Selumetinib and Fulvestrant compounds could perturb GSC invasion when supplied as single cells or spheres in Hi-Q brain organoids (Supplementary Fig. | We then applied high-resolution quantitative 3D imaging and evaluated the abilities of these compounds in perturbing GSC invasion. | Compared to vehicle control, these compounds significantly prevented the invading power of GSCs when supplied with either compact spheres or single cells (Fig. | In summary, the brain organoids generated via the Hi-Q approach are amenable to model glioma and can ultimately serve as a test system to screen potential therapeutic compounds to inhibit the invasive behavior of GSCs. Discussion In vitro brain organoids have shown promise in modeling human brain development, neurological diseases, and drug screening settings. | Second, extensive development of meso- and endodermal lineages from EBs might influence the differentiation of the ectodermal cells that cannot be reversed by the commonly used compounds such as retinoic acid, Noggin, or SB431542. | This allowed us to perform the initial differentiation steps of hiPSC in Matrigel and ROCK inhibitor-free conditions and obtain uniform-sized neurospheres, the early neural tissue intermediates. | We also believe one can optionally add factors that can enhance neural differentiation or maturation, such as retinoic acid, Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) at any time of the culture. | Second, the described method does not use the ROCK inhibitor throughout the culturing. | Our proof-of-principle experiment in this work has successfully used Hi-Q brain organoids in a medium-sized drug screening assay and identified two compounds that effectively perturbed the invasion behavior of patient-derived glioma stem cells (GSCs) in vitro and mouse xenografts. | By generating brain organoids in large quantities in a versatile and robust way, we trust that our approach and developed applications will pave the path for personalized medicine through disease modeling and high throughput compound screening. | The cells were then centrifuged at 100 g for 3 min and resuspended in 1 ml of STEM Diff Neural induction medium (NIM) (Stem cell technologies, Catalog 05835), supplemented with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor (Selleckchem, Cat S1049). | The cells were counted using a hemocytometer, and 3 x 106 cells were suspended in 1 ml of NIM medium, supplemented with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor. | Neurosphere formation and transfer to spinner flasks For the next five days, partial media change was done by replenishing 0.8 ml of NIM with 1 ml of NIM daily without the ROCK inhibitor. | After 21 days, the organoids were further cultured in the Human brain organoid maturation medium devoid of the SMAD inhibitors (SB431542 and Dorsomorphin). | Three plates of the Target Selective Screening Library (Selleckchem) were used for the screening (180 validated selective inhibitors dissolved in DMSO, 1 mM stock solution). | 72 h after organoids were placed in the plates, they were either treated with a 5 µM compound (dissolved in DMSO) or alone. | In parallel, one plate was treated with control compounds. | Compounds were defined as hit compounds if the compound showed only 0 or 1 spot in both time points, i.e., 24 h and 72 h.","CDK (MISC), Co (MISC), ##ck (PER), Selumetinib (MISC), Fulves (MISC), ##tra (ORG), ##nt (MISC)"

Alpha-thrombin can also be involved in the production of IL-6 and IL-1 by macrophages and ECs. It can inhibit the STAT pathway by binding to the protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) thrombin receptor using LIF.64 According to the STAT signaling role in the LIF induction in the heart and the high expression of PAR-1 on cardiomyocytes, it can be hypothesized that thrombin could be an inhibitory factor for LIF function.","C (MISC), C (MISC), Le (MISC), L (MISC), L (ORG), C (MISC), PubMed (MISC), L (ORG), C (MISC), C (MISC), C (MISC), C (MISC), United States (LOC), C (MISC), United States (LOC), C (MISC), C (MISC), C (MISC), C (MISC)"

Polyphenols in Liposomes: A Study on Their Antimicrobial Activity
to Turn a Byproduct into a Tool to Treat Bacterial Infection,"According to the innovative and sustainable perspective of the circular economy model, Olea europaea leaves, a solid byproduct generated every year in large amounts by the olive oil production chain, are considered a valuable source of bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols, with many potential applications. | The extracts were found to be rich in polyphenols up to 26.7 mgGAEgleaves; in particular, hydroxytyrosol-hexose isomers (up to 6.6 mggdry extract) and oleuropein (up to 324.1 mggdry extract) turned out to be the most abundant polyphenolic compounds in all of the extracts. | The extracts demonstrated good antimicrobial activity against both bacterial strains under investigation, with the minimum inhibitory concentration ranging from 140 to 240 μgextractmL and the minimum bactericidal concentration ranging from 180 to 310 μgextractmL, depending on the specific extract and the bacterium tested. | Moreover, a possible synergistic effect between the bioactive compounds inside the extracts tested was highlighted. | Since antiquity, olive trees have been cultivated to produce olive oil and compounds suitable for beneficial and medicinal purposes,1 due to the presence of phenolic bioactive compounds identified in many tree components and byproducts. | Moreover, the amounts of polyphenols produced are strictly related to the type of cultivar, the state of soil hydration, and the condition of plant growth such as temperature, soil properties, light, and irrigation.2,3 Olive leaf extracts (OLEs) contain many of these bioactive polyphenols, exhibiting several health benefits such as antioxidant, antiinflammatory, antitumor, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, immune-stimulant, antiaging, antiviral, and antimicrobial properties.4,5 Regarding the antimicrobial activity, OLEs have been proven to be active against many bacteria species, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative, such as Escherichia coli,6,7Pseudomonas aeruginosa,6,8Staphylococcus aureus,6,7,912Bacillus subtilis,6 and Klebsiella pneumoniae,6 thanks to their ability to affect a multitude of bacterial molecular target.13 Thereby, the recovery and reuse of this byproduct, which represents an economic and environmental problem for olive growers, can be an example of a circular economy, which aims to turn biomass waste and residues into valuable products, in order to minimize waste production. | In this perspective, olive leaf extraction is the key step in the recovery of bioactive compounds, which can be achieved according to traditional techniques14 and innovative green methods.1517 Nowadays, commercial applications of OLEs are mostly limited to folk medicine,18,19 and although many efforts have been made to extend their use from traditional to pharmaceutical applications, their utilization in modern medicine is limited by several challenges, such as the complex composition in active molecules of their extracts, as well as the stability and bioavailability of these molecules. | Generally, the study of the therapeutic and pharmacological properties of plant extracts is limited to determination of the main bioactive compounds with the aim of identifying a candidate that can be used for drug development. | In fact, compared to traditional drug-delivery systems, liposomes offer several advantages, including site-targeting, sustained or controlled release, protection of drugs from degradation and clearance, superior therapeutic effects, reduced toxic side effects, and versatility in encapsulating lipophilic, hydrophilic, and amphiphilic compounds. | The extracts produced were characterized in terms of yield of extraction, total phenolic content, and antioxidant capacity; moreover, the main phenolic compounds present in the extracts were identified and quantified by ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC)photodiode array (PDA)mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. | 2.4.2 Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) The antioxidant capacity of OLE100, OLE50, and OLE20 was determined by TEAC assay following the reduction process of the ABTS radical cation (ABTS) to ABTS by reaction with antioxidant compounds.45 ABTS was produced through the reaction between a 7 mM ABTS solution and 2.45 mM potassium persulfate in water, keeping the mixture under stirring overnight at room temperature in the dark before use. | The percentage of ABTS inhibition (inhibition) triggered by the antioxidant compounds present in OLEs was determined according to the following equation:2where A0 is the absorbance recorded for the diluted ABTS solution and At is the absorbance recorded after 1 or 4 min of reaction of the antioxidant compounds in OLEs with ABTS. | 2.4.3 Determination of the Main Phenolic Compounds in OLEs by UPLCPDAMS Analysis Determination of the main phenolic compounds in the OLEs has been assessed by an UPLC Acquity H-Class Bio (Waters, Milford, MA) set up with a solvent mixing system, an autosampler, a thermostatically controlled column, and a PDA detector, directly coupled with an ion trap mass spectrometer (LXQ-MS System, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). | Phenolic compounds were separated using an Acquity UPLC HSS T3 column (1.8 μm, 150 2.1 mm i.d.; Waters, Milford, MA), maintaining the column temperature at 40 C. | Quantification of the main phenolic compounds in the OLEs was performed using the external calibration method. | 2.6.3.2 OLEs-Loaded Liposomes The EE () of OLEs polyphenols embedded in neutral and galactosylated liposomes was determined by FolinCiocalteu assay (see above) by comparing the amount of polyphenolic compounds entrapped within the lipid vesicles with the amount measured in the dried extracts. | Liposomal suspensions were diluted in MeOH (1:1 vv) to break the lipid aggregates and enhance the release of embedded phenolic compounds. | 2.6.4.2 OLEs-Loaded Liposomes The release of phenolic compounds from OLEs-loaded liposomes was determined by a dialysis method (PBS volume 50 times the total volume of liposome samples). | Gentamicin was tested as a control against both bacterial strains at a concentration of 5 μgmL, showing a bactericidal effect against the ATCC 25923 strain and an inhibitory effect on the ATCC 33591 strain, as was already reported in the literature. | 3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Preparation of OLEs OLEs were obtained by UAE, a versatile green technique for extracting bioactive compounds from plants, applicable at both laboratory and industrial scales. | Compared to traditional solidliquid extraction methods, UAE typically enables the successful extraction of natural products within minutes due to various ultrasound effects that lead to cell wall disruption, enhancing the mass transfer and release of bioactive compounds. | Additionally, UAE allows for the use of less toxic solvents and a reduction in their consumption.52 Bioactive compounds from olive leaves were extracted using mixtures of H2O and EtOH in different ratios. | Its absorption at 734 nm decreases in the presence of antioxidant compounds able to quench it through a direct reduction by electron transfer or by hydrogen-atom transfer. | Therefore, this assay is widely used to evaluate the antioxidant properties of many compounds, food, or plant matrixes.59 The antioxidant capacity of OLEs was determined at two different reaction times (1 and 4 min), following an end-point procedure reported in the literature.45 The results, expressed as millimoles of trolox equivalents per gram of olive leaves extracted (mmolTEgleaves) in Table 1, displayed that the extract prepared using the highest percentage of EtOH in the mixture of extracting solvents (OLE20) shows the highest antioxidant capacity, which in detail doubles upon going from OLE100 to OLE20, with a trend similar to that recorded for the TPC. | 3.5 Identification and Quantification of Phenolic Compounds by UPLCPDAMS In order to identify and quantify the main polyphenols present in the OLEs, an UPLCPDAMS method was developed by analyzing a mixture of several analytical standards representing the main phenolic compounds that can usually be found in O. | In particular, two structural isomers of this compound characterized by a pseudomolecular ion M H with mz 315 but with different RTs (respectively 1.29 and 1.56 min; Figure S3) were detected. | The presence of these types of compounds in olive leaves is already known in the literature.60,61 In the following sections, these two isomers are referred to as HOTyr-hexose isomer a (RT 1.29 min) and isomer b (RT 1.56 min). | In Table 2, the collected results are expressed as milligrams of compound per milliliter of extract (mgmLextract), milligrams of compound per gram of extracted olive leaves (mggleaves), and milligrams of compound per gram of dry extract (mggdry extract). | It is worth noting that, among the compounds identified, OLEUR is the most abundant one in all of the extracts. | Table 2 Amounts of HOTyr-hexose Isomer a and Isomer b, VERB, and OLEUR in the OLEs Produced compound

systems of OLEUR and OLEs were formulated with an unsaturated natural phospholipid (DOPC) and Chol in the presence or absence of the cationic galactosylated amphiphile GLT1 (Chart 1), with the aim of enhancing their solubility in water, stability in biological fluids, and bioavailability at the target sites.62 OLEUR was selected for inclusion in liposomes because it represents the most abundant polyphenol in the OLEs among those quantified. | The inclusion of OLEUR or OLEs in DOPCChol liposomes induced a slight decrease in the ζ-potential values, which become more negative, probably due to localization of the biocompounds loaded onto the membrane surfaces, which could interact with the polar headgroups of DOPC through the formation of hydrogen bonds.67 Instead, DOPCCholGLT1-based liposomes, both empty and loaded, exhibit a positive and quite high ζ potential, with a slight decrease in value when OLEUR or OLEs are entrapped, thus reducing the probability of aggregation phenomena accountable for the physical instability of liposomes.68 Moreover, the positive ζ-potential values recorded represent indirect evidence of GLT1 inclusion within the lipid bilayer. | The in vitro release study of phenolic compounds of OLE100, OLE50, and OLE20 from neutral (1b1d) and galactosylated (2b2d) liposomes was evaluated over time by FolinCiocalteu assay, determining the TPC still encapsulated in liposomes over a period of 24 h. | Chart 2 Molecular Structures of Polyphenols under Investigation All of the polyphenols investigated possess interesting biological properties: HOTyr has been one of the most widely studied polyphenols in the last years due to its antiinflammatory, antithrombotic, anticancer, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties;70,71 VERB is a phenylpropanoid

Derivatives as Potential Modulators of Alpha-Synuclein Amyloid Aggregation,"Efforts to prevent and halt the progression of these diseases involve the search for small molecular compounds. | We identified several compounds with specific functional groups capable of both inhibiting the aggregation of alpha-synuclein and redirecting the fibril formation pathway. | These imidazothiazines could potentially be used in developing highly efficient, small molecular weight protein aggregation inhibitors. | Introduction Amyloid protein aggregation in the form of insoluble fibrils is associated with multiple widespread and incurable disorders, such as Alzheimers or Parkinsons disease.1,2 More than 30 different proteins and peptides have been identified, whose cytotoxic aggregates accumulate in the intercellular spaces of organs and tissues.1 Despite decades of research and enormous effort in deciphering the amyloid aggregation process, there are still very few known treatment modalities,3,4 and the number of affected individuals is projected to increase further in the foreseeable future.5,6 Efforts to prevent and halt the progression of these diseases involve the search for various types of inhibitors, which range from small molecular weight compounds7 to monoclonal antibodies8 or complex drug mixtures.9,10 In the case of small molecules, a number of different class compounds have been identified as having antiamyloid potential by either directly inhibiting the fibril formation process or targeting factors that create conditions suitable for amyloid aggregation. | These compounds include various polyphenols (gallic acid,11 epigallocatechin-3-gallate12), alkaloids (tolserine,13 galantamine14), terpenoids (1.8-cineole,15 α-pinene16), and polyketides (hispidin17). | Several small molecular weight compounds have progressed to clinical trials, such as Anleb138b and NPT100-18A.18 Anleb138b has been found to inhibit alpha-synuclein (α-syn) oligomer formation,19 while NPT100-18A interferes with α-syn aggregation by displacing the protein from membranes.20 Minzasolmin, currently in Phase 2 clinical trials, stands out as one of the most promising potential disease-modifying therapeutics for Parkinsons disease.21 Biophysical evaluations revealed that this compound acts early in the aggregation process by displacing membrane-bound oligomeric α-syn and returning it to a monomeric form, thus preventing the formation of larger protein aggregates and eventually Lewy bodies.21 However, despite hundreds of such potential antiamyloid compounds, the success rate in clinical trials remains very low, with most molecules failing at the initial phases.22 To expand the list of potential amyloid aggregation inhibitors, this work was dedicated to analyzing the activity of a previously unexplored small molecular weight compound group imidazothiazines. | Despite no prior research on their antiamyloid potential, it has been shown that compounds bearing a 1,3-thiazine moiety exhibit a wide range of biological activities,23 including antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, analgetic, and anticancer properties. | To evaluate their possible influence on amyloid fibril formation, we synthesized 21 compounds and examined their effect on the aggregation process of α-syn an intrinsically disordered protein related to the onset and progression of Parkinsons disease.24 We discovered that some of the imidazothiazine derivatives possessed strong antiamyloid properties, which resulted in significantly longer aggregation lag phases. | The inhibitor compounds also redirected the aggregation pathway, causing the formation of fibrils with different secondary structures and morphologies. | However, using 4-iodoaniline as the starting compound, the Sonogashira reaction did not proceed as expected. | For instance, 2-alkynylthio-4,5-dimethylimidazoles 1g,h required higher reaction temperatures to fully convert the starting materials while maintaining similar reaction time to those of compounds 1ac,f (Table 1, entries 13, 6), and the cyclization of compound 1e (Table 1, entry 5) required a prolonged reaction time of up to 12.3 h. | Compounds 2a, 2c, 2d, 2g, and 2i (Table 1, entries 1, 34, 7, 9) were synthesized and isolated in our previous work.25 To evaluate the impact of the protecting group on α-syn aggregation, the Boc group was removed from compound 2j (Table 1, entry 11). | The deprotection was carried out under acidic conditions using TFA in DCM, resulting in compound 3 with a 61 yield. | Table 1 Au(I)Cl Initiated Cyclization Reactions of Various 2-Alkynylthioimidazolesabc a In an MW vial, compound 1 (from 50 mg to 200 mg, 0.170.45 mmol) was dissolved in 5 mL of DCE, and AuCl (10 mol ) was added under an argon atmosphere. | To broaden the scope of the compounds for investigation, ester 2d was modified by substituting it with an amide group. | Notably, compound 2h was synthesized from the corresponding 2-alkynylthio-4,5-dimethylimidazole. | Both methods are viable, depending on whether the goal is to modify an existing compound rapidly or to obtain a specific target compound. | Reaction conditions for amides 5: into a solution of compound 4 (50 mg, 0.17 mmol, 1 equiv) in 5 mL of DCM, EDCIHCl (49.9 mg, 0.26 mmol, 1.5 equiv), HOBt (35.2 mg, 0.26 mmol, 1.5 equiv), and appropriate amine (0.21 mmol, 1.2 equiv) were added. | To investigate the necessity of the imidazothiazine ring for α-syn aggregation, it was decided to synthesize compounds 6 and 7 while retaining the imidazole ring and maintaining the same distance to the functional group as in the imidazothiazine 5a. | The mentioned compounds were obtained under classical alkylation and acylation conditions (Scheme 1). | According to the results, it was evident that the strongest aggregation reduction was achieved with compound 2c bearing an unsubstituted imidazothiazine heterocyclic system. | An additional comparison of compounds 2h and 5a confirmed the decrease in activity resulting from the introduction of methyl groups to the imidazole ring. | (A) Aggregation half-time (t50) ratios (sample t50 values divided by control t50 values) of α-syn samples containing equimolar concentrations of different compounds (100 μM, n 6, error bars are combined standard deviations). | Rescaled images of kinetics with compound 2e are shown below in panel C. | Example kinetic curves of α-syn aggregation in the presence of compounds that inhibit or enhance the reaction. | The crucial role in reducing α-syn aggregation of the thiazine ring was confirmed by tests with compounds 1c, 6, and 7. | Similar to the lack of influence on α-syn aggregation, these three compounds also did not cause any end-point sample fluorescence value deviations from the control samples (Figure 1B). | Comparing compound 2c, with an OEt group, and compound 2b, with an OMe group, revealed that a shorter chain decreased the average aggregation half-time ratio from 1.75 to 1.3. Compound 2a differed from compound 2b only in having a Me group instead of an OMe. This small structural change did not significantly impact α-syn aggregation reduction as the average values were 1.5 and 1.3, respectively. | Despite these differences, all three compounds (2a, 2b, 2c) resulted in a significant increase in both the reaction t50 values, as well as the end-point fluorescence intensities (Figure 1A,B). | Additionally, the functionalization of the phenolic group with an ester moiety in compound 2d showed minimal change in α-syn aggregation, with t50 and fluorescence intensity values being similar to those of the control. | Replacing the ester group with various amides (compounds 5a, 5c, and 5e5f) increased activity compared to compounds 2d and 4, while activity remained the same for compounds 5b and 5d. | The best result was achieved with amide 5e, which yielded an average half-time ratio of 1.8, while the introduction of an additional OMe group in benzyl (amide 5f) resulted in a similar activity to compound 2c, with a half-time ratio of 1.6 (Figure 1A). | Replacing the phenolic group with substituted anilines resulted in enhanced activity of the corresponding compounds. | Unlike all other inhibitors, 2e caused a massive reduction in the sample end-point fluorescence intensity (Figure 1B). | While the addition of the CH2CONHCH2CH(CH3)2 group in compound 2f did not enhance the t50 value as expected and even lowered it, compared to lose aniline 2e and mimicked compound 5a. | Maintaining this additional group while changing the imidazole ring to benzimidazole 2j resulted in an increased average half-time ratio of 1.8, similar to compounds 2c and 5e. | The role of the protecting group in α-syn aggregation reduction was crucial, as the activity was completely diminished in the case of compound 3. | In summary, 21 compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit α-syn aggregation. | Effect on Fibril Structure and Morphology Despite the positive antiamyloid activity of the compounds, a majority of them yielded samples with a significantly higher ThT fluorescence intensity (Figure 1B). | Since none of these compounds possess an intrinsic fluorescence capacity under the ThT-specific excitation and emission wavelengths (Figure S2), the observed phenomenon had two possible explanations. | Either the compounds shifted the equilibrium between the native and aggregated states of α-syn in favor of amyloid fibrils, or the resulting structures had different ThT binding modes.30 We have previously observed a similar event, where antiamyloid compounds redirected α-syn aggregation into fibrils with different secondary structures,31 which, in turn, can affect their dye-binding properties.32,33 To examine this possibility, all samples (n 6 for each compound) were tested using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. | Figure 2 α-Syn aggregate secondary structure dependence on the presence of compounds. | (A, B) Seven different α-syn fibril FTIR spectra (FTIR) and their second derivatives detected after aggregation with or without compounds. | (C) Fibril type distribution in samples without (control 1, control 2) or with different compounds (color-coded boxes indicate the number of each specific type of fibril). | When α-syn was aggregated in the presence of exploratory compounds, four additional types of FTIR spectra were observed. | Type IV was only detected in one out of the six repeats for samples containing compounds 1c, 3, 5d, 5e, and 5f (Figure 2C). | Type VI fibril FTIR spectra were detected only for a small number of samples containing 2b, 2d, 2g, 2i, 5a, and 5d compounds (Figure 2C). | Finally, type VII spectra were observed only in the case of the strongest inhibitor compound 2e. | In some cases, such as with compounds 2c, 2e, and 2j, the aggregation reaction was redirected to produce fibrils with a single FTIR spectrum across all six repeats. | Interestingly, the compounds that increased t50 andor fluorescence intensity were also, for the most part, the ones that promoted the formation of these four different secondary structures (Figures 1A and 2C). | These findings suggest a possible correlation among the inhibitory effect, the resulting aggregate structures, and their ThT-binding ability. | This could be achieved either by the compounds promoting the formation of certain fibril nuclei or by selectively inhibiting the assembly of type IIII aggregate nuclei. | These morphological distinctions indicate that the inhibitory compounds can affect α-syn fibril self-association tendencies and length as well as the appearance of oligomeric or amorphous structures and the resulting overall sample ThT fluorescence intensity. | In order to gain deeper insight into the process and answer these questions, five compounds (2c, 2e, 2j, 4, and 5e) were selected for further study (Figure 4). | According to the obtained experimental data, compound 2e was chosen as the strongest inhibitor, and compounds 2c, 2j, and 5e were selected as moderate inhibitors. | Imidazotiazinylphenoxyacetic acid 4 was also additionally tested as the only compound that displayed a possible aggregation-enhancing activity. | To determine which fibrillization step was influenced by these compounds, α-syn aggregation was carried out under different compound concentrations. | Figure 4 Structures of selected active compounds 2e, 2c, 2j, 4, and 5e. | In the case of all four inhibitors, there was an increase in reaction lag times based on the concentration of the compounds (Figure 5A, 2c, 2e, 2j, and 5e). | Interestingly, each compound displayed different tendencies in how the lag times changed. | In the case of compound 2c, both 50 and 100 μM concentrations resulted in an almost identical value, while 200 μM yielded a considerably higher level of inhibition. | For compound 2e, the inhibitory effect became saturated at 100 μM and a higher concentration did not result in any notable effect. | Compound 2j only displayed an inhibitory effect at 100 and 200 μM, which was also similar under both conditions. | Out of the four inhibitors, 5e demonstrated the most linear dependence between the aggregation lag time and compound concentration. | The previously detected aggregation-enhancing compound 4 resulted in reduced reaction lag times under 50 and 100 μM concentrations. | Interestingly, 200 μM of the compound yielded a significantly higher reaction lag time, suggesting that it may act as an enhancer or inhibitor based on its concentration. | Figure 5 α-Syn aggregation kinetic parameter dependence on different concentrations of compounds. | (AC) Lag time, apparent rate constant, and fluorescence intensity value distribution of α-syn aggregation curves in the presence of different compound concentrations. | Examination of the reaction apparent rate constants (Figure 5B) revealed that all four inhibitors (2c, 2e, 2j, 5e) induced a concentration-dependent decrease in their average value, where the 200 μM compound concentration samples displayed a 2-fold lower rate constant than the control. | However, due to the large stochasticity of this parameter, statistically significant differences could only be determined for compound 2c. | In the case of 2e, the fluorescence intensity was significantly higher under conditions with 50 μM compound, while both higher concentrations yielded samples where the ThT signal was almost completely quenched. | For compound 5e, both 100 and 200 μM conditions resulted in an almost identical and significantly higher fluorescence intensity. | The enhancer compound resulted in a linear dependence between its concentration and the average sample fluorescence intensity values. | If lower compound concentrations are not sufficient to redirect all nuclei formation to a certain structure, then each condition results in a different distribution of fibril types, each with its own specific fluorescence intensity. | To determine if the significant differences in end-point fluorescence intensity were purely related to distinct fibril structures or a shift in monomeraggregate equilibrium, the highest compound concentration samples were centrifuged, and their supernatants were examined with SDS-PAGE. | Surprisingly, all tested compounds resulted in a similar residual concentration of α-syn regardless of the inhibitory effect or the end-point fluorescence values. | Another interesting aspect was the presence of bands between 25 and 40 kDa markers in samples with compounds 2c, 2j, 5e, and 4. | Since this band is not observed in either the monomeric or control sample, it suggests that the compounds may have been capable of stabilizing dimeric and trimeric forms of α-syn. | Compound Toxicity To determine whether the compounds with the highest antiaggregation effects can also counteract the cytotoxic effects of α-syn fibrils, an MTT assay was performed using SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. | When 20 μM of each compound was introduced to the medium without α-syn aggregates, all of them caused a statistically significant reduction in cell viability (Figure 6A, n 9, ANOVA Bonferroni means comparison). | The chosen concentration of compounds for the cell viability assay was much higher than the concentration that would likely exist at target locations after compound administration. | However, it was required to compare the relative toxicity of each compound, as lower concentrations do not significantly deviate from the buffer solution control (Figure S3). | MTT viability assay of the selected compounds (20 μM) in the absence (A) or presence (B) of α-syn amyloid fibrils (20 μM). | The negative effect on cell viability was significantly greater for compounds 2c ((41 4) cell viability) and 5e ((41 4)) when compared to the buffer solution control ((69 4)). | In contrast, the reduction in cell viability was less pronounced for compounds 2e ((56 6)) and 2j ((50 7)), with 2e having the smallest impact. | When the medium contained both α-syn fibrils and the compounds (Figure 6B), 2j stood out by markedly reducing aggregate-induced cytotoxicity. | The effects of compounds 2c ((40 4)), 2e ((38 4)), and 5e ((43 4)) were similar to the fibril control ((45 5)), while neuroblastoma cell viability in the presence of 2j was significantly higher ((59 6)). | Given the compounds 2j dual effect in inhibiting aggregation and reducing cytotoxicity, these results suggest that this compound decreases not only the rate of aggregate formation but also the cytotoxic effects of aggregates themselves. | Further modification of the core structure of compound 2e, resulting in the more substituted benzimidazothiazine 2j, led to a statistically significant reduction in the cytotoxic effects of the aggregates. | However, compound 2j still negatively affected cell viability at relatively high concentrations. | Therefore, future studies should focus on further structure modifications to improve compounds antiamyloid activity and physicochemical properties as potential drug candidates while minimizing their cytotoxicity. | Conclusions In summary, we synthesized 18 compounds containing an imidazothiazine framework (2aj, 3, 4, and 5af) under mild conditions using AuCl as a catalyst. | The significance of the imidazothiazine framework was demonstrated through inhibition activity comparison with two synthesized model compounds, 6 and 7. | The highest half-time ratios were achieved with compounds 2e, 2j, 5e, and 2c, with the best results observed for Boc-protected aniline 2e. | These compounds not only inhibit primary nucleation and shift the monomer-fibril equilibrium toward the nonaggregated state but also stabilize the oligomeric states of α-syn and redirect the aggregation reaction toward fibrils with distinct secondary structures and morphologies. | Additionally, one compound (2j) could reduce the cytotoxic effects of α-syn fibrils. | These findings suggest that compounds containing the imidazothiazine framework could serve as potential α-syn aggregation inhibitors. | Materials and Methods Compound Preparation Detailed compound synthesis protocols and

related to insulin receptors and steroidogenesis, have provided a deeper understanding of the mechanisms driving PCOS.5,6 These advances make SGLT-2 inhibitors a promising therapeutic option due to their ability to improve insulin sensitivity and potentially mitigate hyperandrogenism. | Studies that did not use SGLT-2 inhibitors as the primary intervention, whether alone or in combination with other treatments. | Results Study selection and study populations A total of five RCTs were included, with a combined total of 214 participants (Figure 1).1014 The interventions evaluated in these studies included various SGLT-2 inhibitors, specifically canagliflozin (100 mgday), dapagliflozin (10 mgday), licogliflozin (100 mgday), and empagliflozin (25 mgday). | Summary of the effect of varying SLGT-2 inhibitors on hormonal parameters, menstruations, and clinical hyperandrogenism in patients with PCOS. | FAI: Two studies reported a statistically significant decrease in FAI following treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors. | The decrease in S-DHEA was most notable in studies evaluating canagliflozin and licogliflozin, suggesting these drugs may have a more potent effect on adrenal androgen synthesis compared to other SGLT-2 inhibitors. | This increase in SHBG was more pronounced in studies with participants who had higher baseline insulin resistance, suggesting that the insulin-lowering effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors may play a key role in improving androgen profiles (Figure 2). | Gonadotropins: None of the included studies found a significant effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors on gonadotropin levels (LH and FSH). | This suggests that the primary hormonal effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors in PCOS are likely mediated through their impact on insulin sensitivity and androgen levels rather than direct effects on gonadotropins. | The effect of different studied SGLT-2 inhibitors on testosterone and SHBG levels expressed in percentage of baseline levels. | Menstrual cycle disorders The impact of SGLT-2 inhibitors on menstrual cycle regularity was assessed in two studies. | While SGLT-2 inhibitors appeared to restore more regular menstrual cycles in some participants, the variability in study populations and differences in baseline menstrual irregularities made it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about their efficacy in this regard. | One study noted that the participants who experienced the greatest improvement in menstrual regularity had higher baseline testosterone levels and were more insulin-resistant, suggesting that SGLT-2 inhibitors may be particularly effective in a subset of women with more severe metabolic disturbances. | When compared to metformin, SGLT-2 inhibitors showed similar benefits in terms of improving insulin sensitivity and reducing body weight. | The results showed no significant difference in hirsutism scores between canagliflozin and metformin, indicating that the impact of SGLT-2 inhibitors on clinical hyperandrogenism may be less pronounced than their effects on biochemical hyperandrogenism. | The results suggest that while SGLT-2 inhibitors may offer comparable metabolic benefits to metformin, their effects on hormonal regulation, particularly in the context of hyperandrogenism and menstrual irregularities, are less consistent Discussion PCOS is the most common endocrinopathy in women of childbearing age.13,15 Depending on the diagnostic criteria, its prevalence varies from 4 to 20.1,2 Its pathophysiology is complex and not completely understood. | By improving insulin sensitivity and reducing hyperinsulinemia, SGLT-2 inhibitors may indirectly decrease androgen production and increase SHBG levels, which reduce free androgen bioavailability. | Despite these promising findings, the effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors on androgen levels were not consistent across all trials. | These findings suggest that by reducing hyperinsulinemia and improving insulin sensitivity, SGLT-2 inhibitors may restore the balance between LH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to improved ovulatory function. | Dapagliflozin, an SGLT-2 inhibitor, has been shown to partially restore reproductive function in obese female mice by improving LH profiles and increasing ovulation rates. | 28 SGLT-2 inhibitors have demonstrated neuroprotective properties and the ability to suppress microglia-induced neuroinflammation in the central nervous system. | 29 However, the improvements in menstrual regularity observed with SGLT-2 inhibitors were not significantly different from those seen with metformin. | 30 The similarity in outcomes suggests that while SGLT-2 inhibitors offer a promising alternative, their effects on menstrual cycle regulation may not be superior to traditional treatments such as metformin. | Further research is needed to explore the mechanisms by which SGLT-2 inhibitors influence menstrual cycle regulation. | It is possible that SGLT-2 inhibitors exert similar effects, but the lack of long-term data limits our understanding of their full potential. | Long-term clinical implications The use of SGLT-2 inhibitors in nondiabetic women with PCOS is a novel therapeutic approach, and the long-term clinical implications of this treatment are still unclear. | While SGLT-2 inhibitors have been shown to provide cardiometabolic benefits in diabetic populations, their safety and efficacy in nondiabetic women with PCOS have not been thoroughly evaluated. | The potential cardiovascular protective effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors, such as reductions in blood pressure, body weight, and visceral fat, could offer additional benefits for women with PCOS. | These risks may be more relevant for nondiabetic women, and thus larger, long-term studies are needed to assess the risk-benefit profile of SGLT-2 inhibitors in this population Strengths and limitations This study analyzed five RCTs, selected through a rigorous literature search and the use of strict inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify high-quality literature for analysis. | Clinical implications While SGLT-2 inhibitors present a promising alternative for managing insulin resistance in PCOS, further research is essential to assess their long-term safety and efficacy, especially in nondiabetic populations. | The potential risks of prolonged SGLT-2 inhibitor use, such as urinary tract infections, warrant careful consideration, particularly in women with PCOS who may not have diabetes. | Recommendations for future research Future studies should focus on direct comparisons between SGLT-2 inhibitors and established treatments like metformin and oral contraceptives to better evaluate their relative efficacy in managing hyperandrogenism and menstrual irregularities. | Additionally, studies should investigate which specific subgroups of women with PCOS (e.g., those with higher baseline insulin resistance) may benefit most from SGLT-2 inhibitors. | Larger and longer-duration trials are also needed to establish a clearer understanding of the long-term effects and safety of SGLT-2 inhibitors for reproductive and metabolic outcomes in women with PCOS. | Conclusion This systematic review highlights the potential role of SGLT-2 inhibitors in managing PCOS, particularly through their effects on insulin sensitivity, androgen levels, and menstrual regularity. | The findings suggest that SGLT-2 inhibitors may offer benefits comparable to metformin for metabolic improvements, with the added advantage of possible cardioprotective effects. | However, the impact of SGLT-2 inhibitors on hyperandrogenism and menstrual regulation remains inconsistent across studies. | In conclusion, SGLT-2 inhibitors represent a valuable addition to the therapeutic options available for PCOS management, but further research is required to fully understand their role and establish clear guidelines for their use in this patient population.","##cystic

11660731.xml,The pleiotropic effects of statins: a comprehensive exploration of neurovascular unit modulation and blood–brain barrier protection,"A multitude of neuroprotective agents have been developed to exert neuroprotective effects and improve the prognosis of patients with ischemic stroke. | Statins are a class of pharmaceutical agents that act as inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which are commonly used to reduce lipid levels in patients with cardiovascular disease (Christophe et al. | (2019) Several clinical investigations have demonstrated that statins have a neuroprotective function in the treatment of ischemic stroke (Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease (LIPID) Study Group 1998; Collins et al. | demonstrated that RhoA inhibitors, ROCK inhibitors, and actin polymerization inhibitors enhance eNOS mRNA in cultured ECs by extending the half-life of eNOS mRNA rather than affecting eNOS gene transcription (Laufs et al. | This effect could be inhibited by compound C, an AMPK antagonist. | We foresee a more comprehensive and robust understanding of the pleiotropic effects of statins in neuroprotection, as research on statins and KLF2 in ischemic stroke continues to expand. | ECs treated with XMD8-92, an ERK5 inhibitor, and transfected with ERK5 siRNA demonstrated that ERK5 inhibition abolished the suppression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 production triggered by TNF-α (Wu et al. | (2019) found that ERK inhibitors significantly inhibited the inflammatory response induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, and simvastatin significantly inhibited the LPS-induced increase in TNF-α and IL-6 levels in microglia. | However, the inhibitory effect of simvastatin was significantly greater than that of ERK inhibitors alone, suggesting that statins may also inhibit the secretion of inflammatory cytokines by microglia through other mechanisms. | Previous research has shown that statins stimulate the production of suppressor of cytokine secretion (SOCS), which then functions as inhibitors of the JAKSTAT1 pathway by either blocking JAK tyrosine kinases or preventing STAT1 factors from binding to the cytoplasmic structural domain of the receptor (Huang et al. | Regarding most studies of neuroprotective agents in ischemic stroke and considering the pleiotropic effects of statins on neurons (Gutiérrez-Vargas et al. | The pleiotropic effects of statins in neurons also modulate synaptogenesis Anti-apoptosis Neuronal apoptosis-related signaling pathways are among the targets of most neuroprotective agents, and statins are no exception. | After the addition of atorvastatin, which inhibits the TLR4TRAF6NF-κB pathway, the expression of Bax and caspase-3 is suppressed, and the expression of Bcl-2 is significantly upregulated, increasing the rate of hippocampal neuronal survival (Han et al. | Statins are neuroprotective in ECs by improving EC function and maintaining BBB integrity through the activation of the ERK signaling pathway. | Thus, simvastatin can enhance neuronal autophagic activity following ischemic stroke by regulating the p-AMPKLC3BLAMP2 axis, ultimately promoting neuronal survival. | Conclusion Statins, besides their lipid-lowering effects, can also regulate individual members of the NVU through pleiotropic effects, resulting in the maintenance of BBB integrity and homeostasis, ultimately producing neuroprotective effects in ischemic stroke. | However, owing to various factors, numerous issues still need to be resolved for the wide application of statins as neuroprotective agents in the clinic, such as the type, dosage, and mode of drug delivery, which need to be explored and supplemented by more studies.","B (MISC), N (MISC), ##V (ORG), B (MISC), A (MISC), HM (MISC), B (MISC), B (MISC), NV (ORG), B (MISC), NV (ORG)"

metabolites were identified after SSF, and a Spearman correlation study revealed a direct relationship between antioxidant activities and certain metabolites including phenolic compounds, oligopeptides, and free fatty acids etc. | Among these metabolites, phenolic compounds produced by the shikimic acid pathway were diverse in variety and had the greatest multiple differences. | Trypsin inhibitors, which prevent the absorption of nutrients from food, are efficiently eliminated from soybeans during fermentation, reducing their antinutritional effects (16, 17). | Phenolic compounds were found to be the major contributor to the antioxidant effects in fermented soybeans (3). | Microorganisms convert substances into bioactive compounds that are associated with antioxidant activity through enzymatic processes (13). | Numerous studies have documented the bioactive effects of compounds derived from P. | Three novel amino acid compounds with antifungal activity against Candida albicans were isolated from the ethyl acetate extracts of P. | ostreatus Pleurotus species have the ability to extensively degrade a wide variety of substrates to release small molecules from carbohydrates and other macromolecular nutrients of soybeans. | Microbial enzymes cause the free phenolic compounds to break free from their bound form (50). | Phenolic compounds, which serve as metal chelators, hydrogen donors, reducing agents (free radical terminators), and singlet oxygen quenchers, constitute the majority of antioxidants. | The antioxidative activity of food is highly associated with the total phenolic compounds (3, 51). | Phenolic compounds found in soybean consist of phenolic acids (including ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, vanillic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, syringic acid, salicylic acid, protocatechuic acid, etc.), isoflavones (daidzein, glycitein, genistein and their glucosides) and anthocyanins (52). | Phenolic compounds such as phenolic acids (gallic, caffeic, and p-coumaric acids, benzoic acid and cinnamic acid derivative), flavonoids (myricetin, rutin, naringenin, quercetin, morin, and hesperetin), coumarins, quinones, and styrylpyrones also exist in oyster mushrooms (53). | Additionally, during fermentation, legumes produce more beneficial phenolic compounds because the microorganisms secreting ligninolytic and carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes hydrolyze the phenolic glycosides to release free aglycones (51, 54). | ostreatus) mycelium fermentation can greatly increase the content of phenolic compounds in soybean. | The fermentation of oyster mushroom mycelium led to a significant increase in total phenolic compounds, surpassing the rise observed in other fermented soybean products. | The ABTS scavenging assay can be used with hydrophilic or lipophilic compounds. | The use of cell models to investigate a compounds antioxidant activity has been expanding in prominence since they allow for a more realistic biological environment (62). | However, fungal fermentation is a complex metabolic process that can yield various antioxidant compounds, including phenolic compounds, antioxidant peptides and exopolysaccharides (EPS) (69). | Therefore, monitoring small molecule metabolites in fermented foods using metabolomics is crucial for evaluating their functional properties (72). | These metabolites included 40 amino acids, peptides, and analogs; 32 others; 24 lipids; 21 phenolic compounds; 13 carbohydrates and carbohydrate conjugates; 11 terpenoids; 6 nucleosides, nucleotides, and analogs; 4 organic acids and 3 alkaloids (Figure 4D). | After SSF, amino acids, carbohydrates and their derivatives, and phenolic compounds emerged as the main differential metabolites, which are related to the whole complex growth metabolism during fungal fermentation, including the synthesis of amino acids, the release of active peptides, the degradation of cellulose, the hydrolysis of bound phenols, and the generation of new active ingredients (77). | ostreatus also grew in soybean and degraded protein, carbohydrate, lipid, and other components of soybean into small molecular compounds including amino acids, peptides, carbohydrates and free fatty acids to survive. | The mycelium of six species of the genus Pleurotus were discovered to contain a wide variety of secondary metabolites including phenolic compounds,

stilbenes are the secondary metabolism of most fungus and plants, which are important phytochemicals with a broad range of antioxidant capacities (101). | By supplying hydrogen atoms and generating antioxidant radicals, pheonlic compounds could react with free radicals and transform them into more stable products. | The majority of phenolic compounds found in unfermented soybeans are anthocyanins, phenolic acids (ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, syringic acid, vanillic acid, salicylic acid, protocatechuic acid, etc.), and isoflavones (daidzein, glycitein, genistein, and their glucosides) (52). | However, in this study, it was observed that coumarin, flavonoids, lignan and stilbene were the phenolic compounds that underwent the most significant changed during the solid-state fermentation of soybeans by P. | A significant positive correlation was observed between antioxidant activity and the phenolic compounds including demethylsuberosin, L-Epicatechol, sesamolinol, combretastatin A4, resveratrol, hinokiflavone and cassiasside (Figure 5B). | L-Epicatechol is the flavonoid compound with the largest FC among all the differential metabolites, and its content is 358.1 times that of unfermented soybeans. | L-Epicatechol identified as a potent antioxidant compound in wild soybeans, with levels 1,750 times higher than those in cultivated soybeans (76). | A powerful inhibitor of tubulin polymerization, combretastatin A4 has a significant suppressive effect on the development of tumor cells (107). | Resveratrol possesses numerous biological properties and health benefits, including cardioprotective, neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, and antioxidant qualities (108, 109). | In the OPLS-DA analysis of the entire fermentation process, nine other flavonoids were among the differential phenolic compounds, including genistein 7-O-glucoside, apigenin 7-O-glucoside, acacetin

terpene-active compounds. | 3.4.6 Other compounds From the results of Figure 5D, it could be seen that other non-volatile metabolites also had a high contribution to antioxidant activity, such as alkaloids, organic acids, nucleosides, ketones, and aldehydes (119122). | The aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan were synthesized through shikimate pathway, which are the precursors to the synthesis of phenolic compounds (127). | An aminoglycoside antibiotic hygromycin B was identified in this study, demonstrating that this kind of compound can be synthesized and metabolized by mushroom mycelium (Figure 6). | A total of 154 differential metabolites covering 10 subclasses were detected after SSF, with amino acid and derivatives, carbohydrates, lipids, phenolic compounds, and terpenoids being the major classes of differential metabolites. | The antioxidant activity of fermented soybeans might be associated with specific phenolic compounds, oligopeptides and free fatty acids, etc. | The most abundant of these metabolites were phenolic compounds generated through the shikimic acid pathway. | ostreatus: first, to improve the soybeans properties for the

11660805.xml,Perspectives of traditional herbal medicines in treating retinitis pigmentosa,"Through the study of medical history of the origin of Kampo, we found that herbs medicines contain many neuroprotective ingredients. | It provides us a new perspective on extracting neuroprotective components from herbs medicines to treat neurodegenerative diseases. | 1 Introduction Plants have long served as the primary source of medicinal compounds since the advent of humanity. | Plants harbor a vast array of compounds, and these various compounds have tremendous potential in the development of future medicines. | Neurodegenerative diseases are driven by various shared pathogenic mechanisms, including: (1) abnormal protein dynamics characterized by protein misfolding and aggregation; (2) oxidative stress resulting from the formation of reactive oxygen species and free radicals; (3) dysfunction of neurotrophic factors; (4) mitochondrial dysfunction; (5) neuroimmune inflammation; (6) failure of neuronal Golgi apparatus; (7) disruption of cellaxonal transport; and (8) altered cell signaling. | Unfortunately, gene therapy does not cover all forms and onsets of RPs. Some of the advantages of herbal medicines and extracted compounds in treatment for IRDs include: (1) Genetic testing cannot detect all RP-associated genes or compound heterozygosity. | Each Chinese medicine recipe contains hundreds of known and unknown chemical compounds. | Presently, China recognizes over 10,000 types of traditional Chinese medicines, serving as a vast reservoir of organic compounds waiting to be explored. | From these organic precursor compounds, diverse drugs for numerous diseases can be developed in the future. | 5.2 Current market value of medicinal plant compounds Medicinal plant compounds have a long history, and many early medicines were derived from natural metabolites found in plants. | Plants contain a vast array of compounds, including secondary metabolites, which can be broadly categorized into three groups: phenolics, terpenoids, and alkaloids (48). | Numerous natural compounds from these plants which now serve as active ingredients in many modern pharmaceuticals. | These compounds exhibit chemical novelties that can serve as starting points for developing potential drug candidates targeting complex diseases. | Medicinal plant compounds encompass a variety of active ingredients and secondary metabolites that demonstrate favorable properties, including anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, antiviral, anti-cancer, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic effects. | Antioxidant effect rd10 7 Safranal Stigmas of saffron (Crocus sativus L.) Antioxidant effect, antiapoptotic effect P23H 8 Curcumin Turmeric ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) Antioxidant effect P23H 6 Phytogenic compounds currently in development to treat retinitis pigmentosa Herbal medicines currently being developed for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa include Lycium barbarum polysaccharide, salvianolic acid B, tanshinone IIA, rutin, quercetin, lutein, Safranal, curcumin, etc. | Numerous clinical and epidemiological studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of these plant-derived compounds on ocular diseases (51). | More importantly, these compounds have been tested in animal models of retinitis pigmentosa (details are listed below). | Regular treatment of LBPs benefited the neuronal survival in studies of animal models (6467). | However, polysaccharides have limited solubility in conventional solvent system, leading to difficulties in effective extraction and co-delivery with other compounds (73). | On the other hand, studies have shown the neuroprotective effects of salvianolic acid A (Sal A), that has similar chemical properties with Sal B, in a photoreceptor degenerative model (83). | Tan IIA is another compound found in the root of Danshen, and belongs to a group of diterpenes called tanshinones. | The compound has two pharmacodynamic groups: a catechol group in the B ring and a 3-position OH group. | The neuroprotective effects of lutein in treating ocular diseases have been well documented (114116), including its profound therapeutics in AMD treatment (117119). | The neuroprotection to rod photoreceptor by safranal can be further exemplified in light-damage models (135, 136). | Curcumin is the active compound extracted from turmeric ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) (138, 139). | Other botanicals, including Tibetan medicines (Saussurea medusa Maxim, known as snow lotus) (146148) and health products (various types of tea and mulberry leaves) also have antioxidant and neuroprotective effects. | The eight above-mentioned compounds and associated herbs can be found in this repository, although a large majority of herbal extracts have not been tested in the treatment for inherited retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa. | Additionally, developing new drugs from the organic compounds present in these herbal extracts, combining them with gene therapy, cell therapy, and other innovative approaches, holds great value in overcoming rare human diseases and improving physical and mental well-being.","Chinese (MISC), Tang Dynasty (MISC), Jianzhen (PER), Japanese (MISC), Ganjin (PER), Japan (LOC), China (LOC), Kampo (MISC), Japanese (MISC), Kampo (MISC)"

11661628.xml,Cannabis sativa extracts inhibit LDL oxidation and the formation of foam cells in vitro, acting as potential multi-step inhibitors of atherosclerosis development,"The downregulation of CD36 and OLR1 could be explained by the observed inhibitory effect of the cannabis extracts on the activation of the NFκB pathway by oxLDL. | The extract derived from hemp (E3) showed a chemical profile of a typical fiber, rich in CBDA and CBD and with a low content of the psychotropiccompounds. | To quantitatively determine the inhibitory action of the extracts on oxLDL internalization, a spectrofluorometric technique to measure DiI-oxLDL in the cellular fraction was developed (S2 Fig). | The effect of each of the extracts is greater than the expected additive effects of the cannabinoid components, which suggest either a synergistic effect of the extracts or the presence of a low-abundance compound with a large inhibitory effect (S3 Fig). | Cell survival and metabolic activity To rule out the potential effect of cannabinoids on cell metabolism and survival underneath the inhibitory action on the endocytosis of ox-LDL, the capacity of the J774.1 cells to reduce the metabolic probe MTT, a substrate of the mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase , was analyzed (S4 Fig). | In particular, the LD50 for E1 was more than six times higher than the ED50 obtained for the endocytosis of oxLDL, while with E2 the cells remained metabolically active even in the presence of concentrations as high as 40 μg mL-1 (Table 2), ruling out the cell death or an impairment of the energy metabolism as responsible for the inhibitory effect of the extracts on the uptake of oxLDL. | Effect of receptor antagonists To identify the cannabinoid receptor involved in the inhibitory effect of the cannabis extracts on oxLDL internalization by J774.1 cells, the effect of specific antagonists of the receptors were used. | Similarly, incubation with AM630 (5 μM) for 24h, a CB2 antagonist (KiCB2 31 nM vs KiCB1 5152 nM was unable to counteract the inhibitory effect mediated by any of the three extracts (Fig 5). | In line with the lack of effect of anandamide described above, these results suggest that the canonical cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) do not play a major role on the inhibitory action of the cannabis extracts on the oxLDL uptake by J774.1 cells. | 10.1371journal.pone.0310777.g005 Fig 5 Participation of canonical and non-canonical receptors in the inhibitory action of the extracts on oxLDL internalization. | These results highlight the participation of non-canonical receptors in the formation of foam cells and in the inhibitory effect of the phytocannabinoids. | These results reinforce previous reports on the participation of transient receptor potential cation channels and GPR55 on oxLDL internalization , linking the inhibitory effects of cannabinoids on foam cell formation to calcium signaling. | NFκB represents a family of transcription factors normally kept inactive in the cytoplasm through interaction with inhibitory molecules of the IκB family, the canonical pathway of NFκB activation involves the release of the heterodimer p65p52 associated with IκB. | The inhibitory action of the cannabis extracts on the uptake of oxLDL appears to be mediated by the phytocannabinoids present in the extract mixture since THC, THCA, CBD and CBDA effectively inhibited the endocytosis of oxLDL, being the non-psychotropic phytocannabinoids carrying the carboxylic group (THCA and CBDA), the molecules with the highest therapeutic indexes. | However, the effect of the extracts was greater than the addition of the inhibitory effect of the individual cannabinoid components. | Individual components could exhibit additive effects, their combined impact is simply the sum of their individual effects; antagonistic interactions, or synergistic interactions when compounds produce an effect surpassing the sum of their individual contributions. | About the target receptors interacting with the phytocannabinoids, an antagonistic interplay between phytocannabinoids and TRPV1, TRPV4 and GPR55 receptors appeared as relevant to oxLDL accumulation into the cells and the inhibitory effect of the extracts. | However, using cells that overexpress recombinant human TRPV1, it was reported that, although some phytocannabinoids can stimulate TRPV1 receptors inducing an increase in cytosolic Ca2, most of the compounds were little (CBD and CBDA) or not effective (THC and THCA). | Additionally, several compounds, including CBD, CBDA, and THCA, desensitized the cells to the stimulatory effect of capsaicin on Ca2 uptake . | Additionally, the relevance of TRPV4 receptors in foam cell formation by oxLDL-exposed macrophages has been shown using specific inhibitors and knockout mice, where ablation of these receptors prevented foam cell formation . | The log (inhibitor) vs. | normalized response (Eq 1) was used to determine the effective dose of the inhibitor to achieve 50 of inhibition (ED50). | The cells were then lifted in PBS with cell rakes, centrifuged at 200 g, and resuspended in a lysis buffer, composed as follows: 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2); 100 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; TX-100 1 and the SIGMAFAST protease inhibitor cocktail was added prior to lysing the cells. | J774.1 cells were incubated for 24 hours with the maximum concentration used of each compound and the cell viability determined by the MTT method.","UPLC (ORG), DAD (ORG), UV (MISC), ##is (MISC), CD (MISC), CD (MISC), NF (MISC), ##LD (ORG)"

at Roche (RHTS) we employed human iPSCderived macrophagelike cells, in which phagocytosis is compromised due to increased expression of alphasynuclein that is caused by an allelic triplication of the SNCA gene (3xSNCA) (Haenseler et al., 2017) and screened with Roches proprietary chemogenomic library (Roudnicky et al., 2020). | We initially identified 12 AHTS compounds and 6 RHTS compounds with phagocytosis modulatory potential that were then validated in organotypic hippocampal cultures and in mice. | This approach allowed us to identify the dopaminergicαadrenergic antagonist trifluoperazine and the ribose derivative deoxytubercidin as inhibitors of microglial phagocytosis. | The pathways in which these compounds are active can now be explored for their therapeutic potential to treat diseases related to indiscriminate phagocytosis. | A chemical library comprising 600 compounds was sourced from the Prestwick Chemical Library, based on the compounds chemical and pharmacological diversity, bioavailability, and safety for humans. | Compounds were diluted to working concentration using the Hamiltons Microlab Star automated liquid handling workstation, and the diluted compounds were manually dispensed to the cells. | The compound screening was performed in 2 phases: in the first phase, we tested the 600 compounds in three replicates at 10 μM and selected the top 30 hit compounds based on their effects on engulfment and degradation of apoptotic cells. | To determine which compounds were of interest in the first phase, we set a threshold equal to the mean activity of all compounds standard deviation. | In the second phase, we rescreened the 30 hit compounds at 3 different concentrations (1, 10, and 100 μM, three replicas per concentration). | In each of the phases, we discriminated the effects of the compounds on either engulfment or degradation of apoptotic cells by using two administration paradigms. | To check the effects on engulfment, microglia was incubated with the compounds for 2 h prior to coincubation with the apoptotic cells for 1 additional hour while maintaining the compounds in the medium. | To check the effects on degradation, microglia were coincubated with the apoptotic cells for 1 h and, after removing the excess of unphagocytosed apoptotic cells, they were allowed to degrade the engulfed cells in the presence of fresh media with the compounds for 2 h. | 2.5 AHTS hit selection and confirmation The following variables for each compound were obtained: number of microglia, mean area of Vampire particles per microglia, percentage of phagocytic microglia, and number of phagocytosed objects per microglia. | We visualized the effect of the compounds using a scatter plot to compare PC1 and PC2 and observed that most compounds clustered homogenously. | However, some compounds did not cluster with the rest of the compounds, indicating that they were some potential candidate compounds to modulate phagocytosis (effects if engulfment displayed in Supp. | We then analyzed how each principal component (PC) separated each compound and the way each variable weighted in each PC: PC1 explained close to 60 of the variance, as it had the largest eigenvalue, whereas PC2 explained 32 (Supp. | Thus, we selected the variable number of phagocytosed particles per microglia to assess the potential of these compounds to enhance or block either engulfment or degradation. | After this 2step filtering procedure, we checked the integrity of the data by analyzing two parameters in the dataset: 1, the variability between compounds, to determine how similar was the effect of all compounds by comparing the effect of each compound versus the mean effect of all compounds; and 2, the variability between replicas, to determine how similar is the variability of the effect of all compounds by comparing the SD (between wells) of each compound versus the mean SD of all compounds. | The filtering procedure had no effect on the variability between compounds but reduced the variability between replicas (p .001, Supp. | Thus, variability was reduced while preserving the differences between compounds for both engulfment and degradation. | Next, we removed the data of those compounds that had a toxic effect on microglia (70 of the control). | From 600 initial compounds, 63 were eliminated due to their toxicity in the engulfment experiments, 23 were eliminated due to their toxicity during the degradation experiments, and 4 were eliminated due to their toxicity in both series of experiments (leaving a final number of 510 compounds). | This final filtering did not affect either the variability between replicas or the variability between compounds (Supp. | PCA showed that while most compounds clustered homogenously, some compounds did not cluster along PC 1, indicating potential phagocytosis modulators (Supp. | We followed the same data homogenization strategy as in Phase 1 to decrease variability between replicas by filtering out replicas where the number of microglia and the number of phagocytosed objects showed high variability between wells, and finally filtering out compounds based on their toxicity (Supp. | As in the first phase, we achieved a decrease in the variability between replicas (p .001 in engulfment, no significant differences in degradation) without affecting variability between compounds (p .05) (Supp. | In this phase, no compounds were eliminated due to toxicity on microglia: only three compounds at their highest dose (100 μM) showed toxic effects on microglia and were subsequently removed (at that dose only). | The variability between replicas and compounds was also monitored after eliminating toxic compounds. | The zscore that summarized the effect of each compound across the three concentrations was calculated as follows: ZscoreMeanX1X10X100MeanallStd.devall 2.6 Human iPSC culture and differentiation to macrophagelike cells Two human iPSC lines were used: SBNeo1 as control and SFC8310303 carrying a synuclein triplication (3xSNCA), both generated in the StemBANCC consortia and deposited at European Bank for iPSCs (Gutbier et al., 2020). | A single cell suspension of iPSCs (4 106 cells) was plated into AggreWell 800 iPSCs were plated into AggreWell 800 (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) plates in mTesR1 supplemented with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor (Y27632, Calbiochem Millipore, Burlington, MA). | 2.7 RHTS screening At day 5 of differentiation to macrophagelike, Roches compounds prediluted in culture media were added at 1 μM final concentration, with 6 replicate plates and incubated for 24 h. | 2.8 RHTS hit selection and confirmation In total 2200 compounds were screened at 1 μM with 6 replicates for their potential to increase phagocytosis in the macrophages derived from the 3xSNCA iPSC line. | 2.9 Organotypic cultures and compound incubation Hippocampal organotypic slices were prepared following the protocol described in (Beccari et al., 2018). | At day 7 of culture, hippocampal slices were incubated with 100 μM of the compounds diluted in organotypic culture medium for a total of 6 h. | After 5 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing the compounds and 5 μgmL propidium iodide (PI). | After 1 hour of incubation with compounds and PI, slices were fixed in cold 4 paraformaldehyde solution for 40 min and, after rinsing with 1X PBS, were stored at 4 C until immunofluorescence processing. | Briefly, osmotic minipumps (flow rate 1 μLh; Model 1003D, Alzet) and brain infusion catheter tubes (Alzet) were filled with 100 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Thermo Fisher), Roche compound 1 (deoxytubercidin), Trifluoperazine (Selleckchem), and PSB0739 (Tocris Bioscience) (all at 10 μM concentration in PBS with 1:1000 DMSO) and connected. | To calculate the most consistent effect (X) across concentrations (1, 10, and 100 μM), we calculated a zscore from each compound: zscoreMeanX1X10X100MeanallStd.devall In RHTS, Images were analyzed in parallel to acquisition using Harmony (PerkinElmer; Waltham, MA, USA) predefined building blocks for detection of nuclei using the Hoechst Channel, detection of cytoplasm using the Hoechst reflection within the cytoplasm and the spot detector to detect pHRodo positive spots within the cytoplasm. | Mean, median, SD and SEM of phagocytic index over 6 replicates was calculated and the compounds that robustly induced phagocytosis were selected for further hit validation in dose response. | 3 RESULTS 3.1 Achucarro high throughput screening (AHTS) In the first phase of the AHTS, 600 Prestwick compounds were tested using 2 administration paradigms to check for effects in either engulfment or degradation, in triplicates at 10 μM (Figure 1a,b; Supp. | In order to select the candidate compounds that could modulate phagocytosis, we plotted their effect on engulfment versus degradation (Figure 1c), setting a threshold equal to the mean activity of all compounds SD. | We selected the top 30 compounds that, based on the data distribution, belonged to three different groups: 1, All compounds that surpassed the threshold for enhancing engulfment and degradation; 2, those that crossed the threshold for inhibiting engulfment; and 3, an extra compound that showed a very strong enhancement of engulfment and a very strong inhibition of degradation. | Those 30 candidate compounds were identified and screened in a second phase at 3 concentrations (1, 10, and 100 μM; data from one compound was lost due to technical reasons, resulting in 29 compounds tested) (Supp. | To obtain more robust data about their activity and an estimation of the working concentration of these compounds for their use in vivo, we analyzed them based on a zscore that accounted for a global effect of the 3 concentrations tested. | Those compounds with a zscore greater than 1 or lower than 1 were selected as hits (14 compounds, of which 12 were tested later in organotypic slices) (Figure 1d). | Comparing the results obtained from this phase with the results obtained from phase 1, we observed that some of the compounds displayed the same effect on phase 1 and phase 2 (34.5 of compounds for engulfment and 42.4 for degradation), showing a significant correlation between the two phases (Supp. | However, some compounds displayed opposite results in the two phases, even when we compared the effect of the 10 μM concentration, suggesting that independent testing of the compounds in the two phases is necessary to obtain robust results. | The compounds were categorized in 5 groups: proengulfment compounds; prodegradation, antiengulfment, prodegradation compounds; and a compound with mixed proengulfment and antidegradative properties. | The mechanisms of action of these compounds were multiple, but several of them targeted main neurotransmitter pathways, such as dopamine, serotonin, adrenaline, noradrenaline, and GABA (trifluoperazine, nafronyl oxalate, maprotiline, dobutamine, baclofen). | Another group of compounds targeted sodium and potassium channels (gliclazide, nicardipine, zoxazolamine). | A final group of compounds targeted pathways related to DNA and RNA and are used as antitumoral agents (N6methyladenosine, thioguanosine, doxorubicin). | FIGURE 1 AHTS screening and hit compounds. | In blue, compounds selected as candidate potentiators of phagocytosis. | In mauve, compounds selected as candidate inhibitors of phagocytosis. | (d) Zscore (arbitrary units) of compounds that potentiate engulfment (blue) or degradation (green), and inhibit engulfment (red) or degradation (orange) of apoptotic cells across concentrations, compared to the rest of the compounds. | The effect of the compounds was deemed significant if their engulfment or degradation zscores were higher or lower than 1 (dotted purple lines). | Premacrophages were differentiated to macrophages in the final assay format, incubated with compounds for 24 h and pHRodo labeled apoptotic NPCs for the last 2 h of incubation. | FIGURE 2 RHTS screening, controls, and hit compound identification. | Cells were incubated with 3 times the amount of fixed, pHrodo labeled NSCs. (e) Comparison of the median versus the average effect on 6 replicates of the 2200 compounds at 1 μM on the phagocytosis of macrophages. | Each dot represents one compound, the color indicates the compound source plate and the size of the symbol the standard deviation between replicates (n 6). | (f) Hit compounds from the primary screen were identified as those with phagocytosis above 1.3 relative to control and SEM below 0.2 (blue circle) from the 6 replicates. | The assay hits that were potential inducers of phagocytosis were identified as those compounds with a ratio of phagocytic microglia higher than 1.3 compared to control and SEM below 0.2 (Figure 2f). | From this last group, 6 compounds were selected for further validation in organotypic cultures (Figure 2j,k). | 3.3 Organotypic culture validation of AHTS and RHTS compounds Next, we tested both the AHTS and the RHTS candidate compounds in hippocampal organotypic slices, which retain all the cell types from the CNS, as well as the structures and connectivity (Beccari et al., 2018), and in which apoptotic cell death occurs in the first days of the culture (Lossi et al., 2009). | We incubated the organotypic slices with the compounds at 100 μM (the highest dose used in the AHTS) for 6 h, based on the effective concentration range of drugs we have previously tested to modulate microglial phagocytosis in these cultures (Abiega et al., 2016; Beccari et al., 2023), and analyzed cell death, microglial numbers, microglial phagocytosis of dead (apoptotic and necrotic) cells, and microglial morphology. | The candidate compounds had been categorized in the AHTS into four different groups based on their effects on engulfment and degradation separately. | Therefore, both proengulfment and antidegradation compounds would increase the Ph index, and prodegradation and antiengulfment compounds would decrease it. | These seemingly counterintuitive scenarios can be discriminated by taking into account the total number of dead cells, which should be expected to decrease in proengulfment and prodegradation compounds, and increase in antiengulfment and antidegradation compounds. | Due to technical reasons related to the vehicle in which the compounds were dissolved and the number of compounds, we divided the experiments into different batches. | As controls, we used untreated (UT) slices and the vehicle in which the compounds were dissolved. | First, we tested compounds dissolved in DMSO: potential phagocytosis enhancers Roche compounds Ro16, thioguanosine, N6methyladenosine, danazol, and gliclazide, potential phagocytosis inhibitors oxethazaine and zoxazolamine, and the mixedeffect compound doxorubicin. | We first assessed Roche compounds, and we found that deoxytubercidin (Ro1), a ribose derivative, highly increased the number of apoptotic and PI cells (Figure 3ac), and strongly inhibited their phagocytosis (Figure 3d,e). | In the second batch of Roche compounds, we did not observe any significant changes in cell death, phagocytosis, or microglia numbers compared to the DMSO vehicle but not to UT slices (Supp. | Overall, these results identified deoxytubercidin as a phagocytosis inhibitor in organotypic slices. | (g) 3D reconstructions of representative morphological features of microglia for each tested compound. | Note the variable degrees of dendrite branching, number and lengths of processes, and soma sizes for microglia exposed to different compounds. | In the next batch, we assessed two potential engulfment enhancers that shared a mechanism of action with deoxytubercidine: thioguanosine, a purine analog used as an antineoplastic compound (De, 2023); and N6methyladenosine, an mRNA regulator involved in tumorigenesis and compound resistance (He et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2023). | Both compounds reduced apoptotic cells phagocytosis but only m6A increased the number of dead cells or microglia (Supp. | As deoxytubercidin, both thioguanosine and N6methyladenosine behaved as phagocytosis inhibitors in organotypic slices, although they did not lead to delayed apoptotic cell clearance and accumulation, possibly because the effects on phagocytosis were stronger in deoxytubercidin. | We then analyzed a compound with mixed proengulfment and antidegradation properties in the AHTS, doxorubicin, an anthracycline antibiotic used as an antineoplastic agent (Carvalho et al., 2009; JohnsonArbor Dubey, 2023). | Overall, the three compounds in this batch, and thioguanosine, N6methyladenosine, and doxorubicin behaved as phagocytosis inhibitors in organotypic slices similar to deoxytubercidine, regardless of their initial classification in the AHTS. | 18.2 1.2, p .09, with no statistically significant effect in each individual experiment), we skipped it in the rest of the compounds dissolved in DMSO (danazol, gliclazide, oxethazaine, and zoxazolamine). | In the next batch, we analyzed two compounds that were classified as proengulfment compounds in the AHTS: danazol, an antigonadotropic and antiestrogenic agent (Barbieri Ryan, 1981); and gliclazide, an antihyperglycemic compound (Khunti et al., 2020). | We then analyzed two compounds classified in the AHTS as degradation blockers: oxethazaine, a local anesthetic and antacid used to relief pain associated with the digestive system (McMillen et al., 1992; Seifter et al., 1962; Yasuhara Levy, 1988), and zoxazolamine, a centrallyacting muscle relaxant (McMillen et al., 1992; Yasuhara Levy, 1988). | Next, we assessed two compounds dissolved in methanol, maprotiline and nicardipine, that were originally classified as prodegradation and antiengulfment in the AHTS, respectively. | Maprotiline is a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor used as an antidepressant (Wells Gelenberg, 1981). | This compound increased the number of dead cells and reduced their phagocytosis, without changing microglial numbers but reducing their complexity (Supp. | These results suggest that both maprotiline and nicardipine were phagocytosis inhibitors in organotypic slices. | Finally, we analyzed compounds dissolved in water, the potential degradation enhancer dobutamine, and the engulfment blockers trifluoperazine and nafronyl, as initially classified in the AHTS. | These findings indicated that nafronyl had a toxic effect, whereas trifluoperazine behaved as an antiengulfment compound in organotypic slices. | In summary, hippocampal organotypic slices allowed us to validate some compounds identified in the AHTS and RHTS in a complex ex vivo system that maintains neuronal connectivity and microglia function. | Most compounds (deoxytubercidin, thioguanosine, N6methyladenosine, doxorubicin, gliclazide, maprotiline, nicardipine, nafronyl, trifluoperazine), regardless of their original classification in previous HTS, behaved as antiengulfment compounds at 100 μM in organotypic slices: they decreased the Phagocytic index and increased the number of dead cells. | While we have not explored the origin of this discrepancy between the effect of the compounds in cultured cells versus organotypic slices, it is likely that some differences may be related to the model system itself. | The only compounds with consistent effects between the HTS and the organotypic cultures were nicardipine and trifluoperazine, both confirmed antiengulfment compounds. | 3.4 In vivo validation of AHTS and RHTS compounds Following our bottomup strategy in the validation of microglial phagocytosis modulators, we tested in vivo the compounds with the most robust effects on the inhibition of engulfment: deoxytubercidin and trifluoperazine. | Overall, across all compounds and experiments (in organotypics and in vivo), we found a significant correlation of the Ph index with microglial numbers (Figure 7a). | To explore how phagocytosis in microglia could be addressed pharmacologically, we have employed an unbiased bottomup approach staring with a phenotypic (i.e., phagocytosis) small molecule HTS in mouse primary microglia (AHTS) and human iPSCderived macrophages (RHTS), followed by initial testing of a few hits in an organotypic hippocampal slice cultures paradigm of apoptotic cell phagocytosis, and confirmation of an effect for two compounds of interest in an in vivo paradigm of removal of apoptotic newborn cells in the adult hippocampal neurogenic niche in mice. | For the two HTS, we chose two separate chemical libraries, which contain small molecules that are wellannotated, related to their known mechanism. | Overall, our approach exemplifies that wellannotated chemical libraries can be used to discover novel modes of action for small molecules with known mechanism. | Here, we identified the antipsychoticantineoplastic trifluoperazine and the ribose derivative deoxytubercidin as inhibitors of microglial phagocytosis in our experimental setup. | These platforms have focused on microglial functions, including the expression or release of inflammatory, immunomodulatory andor neuroprotective factors (Hansen et al., 2010; Patil et al., 2021) or exovesicles (Ruan et al., 2022), or on the response to pathological protein aggregates derived from amyloid beta or alphasynuclein (Bassil et al., 2021). | In addition to the proper screening, here we also describe a complete analysis pipeline, including filtering steps for sources of variability (such as technical replicates and toxic effects); the use of a zscore to compile data from different concentrations; and validation of selected hit compounds in organotypic mouse hippocampal slice cultures and an in vivo paradigm of phagocytic removal of newborn apoptotic cells in the neurogenic niche. | 2, Timing: discriminating between engulfment versus degradation along a time course can provide additional information about the mechanism of action of the hit compounds. | 3, HTS design: we recommend including reference compounds that induce or inhibit phagocytosis (i.e., a clear and bestdefined regulator of function) or have no effect (inert, like a buffer control), commonly referred to as positive and negative controls. | It is important to note that some compounds may only show a specific mode of action at low concentrations and hit offtargets or become toxic at higher concentrations. | 5, Library diversity: the polypharmacology of the compounds and their known must be considered when selecting the chemical library. | 6, Compound cell specificity: because neurons and microglia communicate bidirectionally, some compounds may indirectly regulate microglial phagocytosis by acting on neurons, which in turn may modulate microglial function. | 7, Validation: it is imperative to validate the hit compounds in complex systems, especially in vivo or in 3D multicelltype human model systems. | 4.2 Trifluoperazine as microglial phagocytosis inhibitor Our bottomup approach and experimental setup allowed us to identify trifluoperazine as a phagocytosis inhibitor with stronger inhibitory effect at 100 μM than PSB0739, a highly specific P2Y12R inhibitor (Cserép et al., 2020). | Trifluoperazine is a phenothiazine, a firstgeneration heterocyclic antipsychotic compound that has recently been shown to display antitumoral effects as well (Kidron Nguyen, 2024). | It was also recently identified as a potential phagocytosis inhibitor in a machine learningdriven screening based on its in silico inhibitory activity of MEGF10 (Multiple EGF Like Domains 10) (Gravina et al., 2022), an astrocyteenriched receptor of the complement C1q protein that mediates astrocytic synaptic phagocytosis (Chung et al., 2013). | Our results, however, invite to speculate that the beneficial effect of trifluoperazine in cancer may be compromised if the resident phagocytes have impaired their ability to clean up apoptotic tumor cells because of the antiphagocytic effect of the compound. | 4.3 RNADNA metabolism and microglial phagocytosis Our screening also validated deoxytubercidin as a phagocytosis inhibitor in organotypic slices and in vivo, although it had been initially classified as enhancer in the RHTS. | Interestingly, the purine analog thioguanosine, and the mRNA regulator N6methyladenosine were also initially classified as phagocytosis enhancers in AHTS but were confirmed as inhibitors in organotypic slices. | In summary, we demonstrate that based on wellannotated chemical librariers one can establish phenotypic screens to identify compounds with the ability to modulate the phagocytic function of microglia in vitro and in vivo. | One reason why we detected mostly inhibitors of phagocytosis rather than enhancers could be that the cells in culture are already extremely efficient in that function and further optimization is difficult to achieve, even for iPSCderived macrophages that show a clear deficit due to a genetic predisposition (i.e., 3xSNCA). | The compounds identified in our screens are a starting point to study microglia function, which may be regulated by thus far unknown molecular mechanisms.","Achucarro (LOC), Prestwick Chemical Library (ORG), Roche (ORG)"

These lasting changes highlight a critical role for GABAreceptive microglia in mediating the selective elimination of inhibitory synapses and reveal that the disruption of this inhibitory pruning contributes to permanent deficits in neural circuitry not only in the cortex, but in their downstream projection targets (Figure 2D). | The relationship between microglia and inhibitory synapses requires further investigation, particularly in other brain regions, as elucidating how these cells regulate inhibitory neurotransmission will provide critical insight into their complex roles in neural circuit formation. | While astrocytes have numerous roles in regulating neuronal survival and activity, this review will focus on astrocytic functions at synapses. | This change is accompanied by an increase in the frequency of mIPSCs, suggesting an imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission induced by the absence of NL2 (Stogsdill et al. | Interestingly, in the cortex of 1

formation (Elmariah et al. | Astrocytes nearly double the quantity of clustered GABAA receptors (GABAARs) on neuronal surfaces apposed to inhibitory presynaptic terminals and astrocyteconditioned media cocultured with hippocampal neurons induces a similar effect (Elmariah et al. | BDNF signaling through its TrkB receptor is required for astrocytic promotion of GABAAR cluster formation and subsequent stabilization of developing inhibitory synapses. | Perhaps most intriguingly is that neither BDNF release nor TrkB activation is required in astrocytes themselves to induce inhibitory synaptogenesis, but rather, astrocytes mediate the neuronal release of BDNF and its subsequent binding to neuronal TrkB to facilitate GABAAR clustering (Elmariah et al. | This requires further investigation in order to foster understanding of how astrocytes communicate with neurons to carry out inhibitory synaptogenesis and, as such, mediate a critical step in neural circuit formation

promote inhibitory synapse formation (Elmariah et al. | CamKII then recruits neuroligin 2 (NL2) to the postsynaptic domain to induce inhibitory synaptogenesis. | (C) Astrocytic NRCAM interacts with neuronal NRCAM, which colocalizes with the GABAergic synaptic scaffolding protein, gephyrin, and regulates the inhibitory synapse organization. | The Nterminal goes on to help form perineuronal nets, while the Cterminal domain goes to the postsynaptic neuron to induce inhibitory synapse formation (Takano et al. | 2.4.2 TGFβ1 While TGFβ1 has been identified as an astrocytesecreted factor involved in excitatory synaptogenesis through Dserine release and NMDA receptor activation, it also plays an essential role in mediating the formation of inhibitory synapses (Figure 4A) (Diniz et al. | The application of astrocyteconditioned media to murine cortical neuronal cultures increases the quantity of inhibitory synapses by approximately 85 while also elevating levels of VGAT and GABAA (Diniz et al. | This synaptogenic effect is completely blocked when TGFβ1 function is neutralized, while treatment of cortical neurons with purified TGFβ1 results in a 90 increase in inhibitory synapses (Diniz et al. | The synaptogenic effect of TGFβ1 is also observed in vivo, as injection of this molecule into the cerebral cortex increases levels of inhibitory synapses by up to 135 (Diniz et al. | Additionally, how TGFβ1 induces NMDA activation and subsequently selects between promoting excitatory synapse versus inhibitory synapse formation requires further exploration, as both of these pathways involve the same initial steps. | Further, more recent studies examining the synaptogenic effect of TGFβ1 on gliafree cortical neuronal cultures observed no induction of inhibitory synapse formation (Irala et al. | This raises the question of whether TGFβ1 is indeed a mediator of astrocyteinduced inhibitory synaptogenesis (Figure 4B), particularly considering that TGFβ1 is predominantly expressed by microglia and not astrocytes in vivo. | Although NRCAM in perisynaptic astrocyte processes is localized to both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, NRCAM deletion only alters astrocytic proximity to inhibitory synaptic elements, and thus is necessary to mediate adhesions specifically between astrocytes and inhibitory synapses (Takano et al. | Deletion of NRCAM from either astrocytes or neurons in the mouse visual cortex significantly reduces inhibitory synapse density and mIPSC frequency, revealing that a loss of perisynaptic NRCAM interaction produces deficits in GABAergic transmission (Takano et al. | Although it is evident that neuronal NRCAM and astrocytic NRCAM interact to facilitate functional and structural inhibitory synaptogenesis (Figure 4C), how this homophilic interaction mediates processes such as gephyrin recruitment require further investigation. | When NCAN is applied to cortical neurons, inhibitory synapse formation is observed (Irala et al. | Mice lacking NCAN exhibit an approximate 50 reduction in inhibitory synapses in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) at P30, accompanied by a significant reduction in mIPSC frequency (Figure 4D) (Irala et al. | The functional consequences of impaired astrocytic NCAN release on maintaining excitatoryinhibitory neurotransmission balance require further exploration. | Additionally, because NCAN is also critical for PNN formation, it is plausible that astrocytemediated inhibitory synaptogenesis through NCAN is coupled to the proper orchestration of PNNs, another mechanism by which astrocytes may affect inhibitory circuitry to limit plasticity. | Similarly, IL33 deletion causes a significant increase in excitatory and inhibitory synapses onto alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord at postnatal day 30 (Vainchtein et al. | Collectively, these data reveal that astrocytemicroglial communication mechanism that results in downstream activation of AKT promotes proper microglial

11663375.xml,Natural Modulators of Key Signaling Pathways in Skin Inflammageing,"This review explores the signaling pathways associated with skin inflammageing, as well as the natural plants and compounds that directly or indirectly target these pathways. | Role of the NF-κBRIG-I Pathway NF-κB activation, driven by ageing factors such as ROS, senescent cells, and DNA damage, leads to increased inflammatory cytokine production (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8), further amplifying inflammatory and age-related disturbances through classical pathway activation.18 The trans-activation motifs of NF-κB are key regulators associated with ageing across human tissues, and persistent NF-κB signaling activation fosters cellular senescence.19 SASP produced by senescent cells necessitates NF-κB signaling to impact adjacent youthful cells.20 RIG-I, a pattern recognition receptor in the skin, identifies viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns,21 and its blockade mitigates senescence-associated inflammation, extending cell growth.22 RIG-I is upregulated in senescent cells via the ATM-IRF1 axis, which mediates IL-6 and IL-8 expression.23 Klotho, by interacting with RIG-I, inhibits induced IL-6 and IL-8 expression, acting as an anti-ageing agent by dampening RIG-I-mediated inflammation.24 Loss of the ageing-related protein Klotho triggers the NF-κBRIG-I pathway, enhancing pro-inflammatory mediator production.25 Furthermore, RIG-I promotes keratinocyte proliferation and wound repair by inducing tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease-1 (TIMP-1) expression through NF-κB signaling pathway.23 NF-κBRIG-1 activation driven by ageing factors therefore increases inflammatory cytokine production and affects skin ageing.15 Role of the mTOR Signaling Pathway The mTOR regulates cell growth, metabolism, and nutrient signaling, with hyperactivation often linked to inflammation.26 This pathway comprises two complexes: mTORC1 is vital for regulating cell growth and substrate phosphorylation to increase anabolism (eg, mRNA translation, and lipid synthesis) or inhibit catabolism (eg, autophagy); mTORC2 promotes cell survival and cytoskeletal organization via Akt activation, with both complexes contributing to inflammageing (Figure 3a).27 Overexpression of the upstream mTOR modulators (eg, PI3Ks, Akt, TNF-α, Ras, Raf kinase, MEK, ERK12, and Rsk) escalates mTORC1 activity, positioning mTOR at the center of inflammageing processes.26 mTOR overactivation induces cellular senescence, whereas inhibition through rapamycin or genetic interventions halts senescence, attenuates SASP, and prolongs the lifespan of mice.28,29 Thus, inhibiting the PI3KAKTmTOR or RASERKmTOR pathways and restoring autophagy may decelerate skin cell senescence. | This augmentation in NAD concentration subsequently serves as a critical signal to induce the expression of Sirt1.43 Sirt1, in turn, deacetylates LKB-1, an AMPK activator, forming a positive feedback loop.44 In terms of functionality, activation of AMPK can suppress mTORC1 through activating TSC12, and it also prompts Sirtuins to catalyze the deacetylation of FoxO proteins or autophagy-associated proteins, namely ATG5 and ATG7,45 resulting in an upregulation of PGC-1α expression which improves mitochondrial biogenesis, and cytoplasmic p53 inhibition, which facilitates autophagy.43 Sirtuins, comprising seven proteins (SIRT1SIRT7), play a pivotal role in postponing cellular ageing and augmenting organismal lifespan through the regulation of various cellular mechanisms.46 Age-related metabolic inflammation depletes NAD, which subsequently reduces Sirt activity. | Table 1Natural Plants That Regulate Skin Inflammageing via the NF-κBRIG-I PathwayNo.Natural PlantCompoundPlant SourcesMain CompoundsMechanism of ActionModel of EvaluationReferences1Centella asiatica extractAlkaloids, flavonoids, phenols, tannins, and terpenoidsNF-κB pathway;

11663940.xml,Pharmacological inhibition of the MAP2K7 kinase in human disease,"While there has been interest in inhibiting JNK due to its involvement in inflammatory processes and cancer, there is increasing focus on developing MAP2K7 inhibitors to enhance specificity when MAP2K7 activation is associated with disease progression. | Despite some progress, further research is needed to fully comprehend the role of MAP2K7 in cancer and assess the potential use of kinase inhibitors in cancer therapy. | This review examines the role of MAP2K7 in cancer and the development of small-molecule inhibitors. | Abnormal activation of kinases has driven the development of small-molecule inhibitors for treating diseases. | The catalytic domain contains a conserved core comprising two lobules (N-terminal and C-terminal) connected by a hinge region that defines the ATP-binding domain, which is the target of most kinase inhibitors. | Kinase inhibitors can be classified into seven types (type I-VII) based on their binding (to the active ATP-binding site, inactive ATP-binding site, or different domainallosteric) and binding mode (reversible or irreversible). | The tyrosine kinase inhibitor Imatinib (classified as type IIA) was the inaugural small-molecule inhibitor to receive approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2001. | Its successful management of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia marked a significant milestone in cancer therapy and paved the way for the development of various kinase inhibitors. | The availability of crystal structure, chemical probes, and cell-free assays for MAP2K7, a member of the STE kinase family in the kinome, facilitates the development of specific inhibitors by medicinal chemistry. | NF𝜅B activates the inhibitor GADD45β. | Although the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor Sunitinib caused cardiotoxicity in old rats, the drug led to upregulation of miR-133b and inhibition of MAP2K7 in young rats (9). | In addition to homeostatic and physiological regulation, the MAP2K7-JNK pathway can be modulated with small molecules. | Cobaltic protoporphyrin IX chloride (Rosiglitazone), an anti-diabetic medication, has a neuroprotective effect by inducing heme oxygenase that prevents the assembly of the MELK3-MAP2K7-JNK3 complex via JIP1 and thus heme oxygenase can be beneficial in cases of cerebral ischemia (18). | While this finding does not establish a cause-effect relationship, the aberrant activation of these kinases provides an opportunity to investigate the use of specific small molecule inhibitors to inhibit prostate tumor growth. | We studied the tumor suppressor function of the Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) in pediatric leukemia because we identified that KLF4 inhibits T cell proliferation during homeostasis, and it is expressed at low levels in lymphoblasts from children with T-ALL, especially in the poor prognoses of ETP-ALL and TLX groups and the inhibitory role in T cell proliferation (5052). | Pharmacological modulation of MAP2K7-JNK activity There is an increasing interest in developing MAP2K7 inhibitors not only to treat human disease but also as a tool to investigate MAP2K7 in T-ALL pathobiology. | Specific inhibitors are needed because most small molecules used to study MAP2K7, with a few exceptions, were identified as off-target inhibitors. | Although medicinal chemistry aims to increase specificity through covalent inhibition, clinical oncologists are concerned that covalent inhibitors may cause off-target toxicity. | Despite this, many kinase inhibitors used in the clinic covalently bind to the target. | Selected compounds with low IC50 were further optimized for stabilization (D-enantiomers), cell membrane permeability (replacing the N-terminal acetyl group with a benzyloxycarbonyl group), and chemical derivatization to improve bioavailability while retaining anticancer activity. | Chemical compound Specificity MAP2K7 inhibition(IC50) CytotoxicityIC50 Cancer Activity in a mouse model(dose) Ref. | DTP3 peptide Inhibits interaction of GADD45β and MAP2K7 Activation(28 nM) 17-31 nM MM (14.5 mgKg) (54) HWY336 MAP2K4, MAP2K7 Inhibition(10 μM) n.d. n.d. n.d.

and MAP2K7 kinase inhibitor in the human embryonic kidney HEK293 cell line ( Table 3 ) (55). | HWY336 competes with substrates but not with ATP via non-covalent interactions in the activation loop of MAP2K4 and MAP2K7, yet this inhibitors anticancer properties have to be investigated. | A structure-based design was conducted using the structure of an EGFR inhibitor able to inhibit MAP2K7 with low potency because pyrazolopyrimidine-based compounds inhibit EGFR, and the ATP binding pocket of EGFR is similar to MAP2K7 ( Table 3 ) (56). | The compound 4a showed the highest potency (10 nM) in a biochemical assay and inhibited MAP2K7 by covalently reacting to Cys218 at the end of the hinge region in the ATP binding domain. | Kinome studies of compound 4a revealed off-target kinases with more than 50 inhibition (e.g., BLK, BMX, BTK, ITK, JAK3, mTOR, and S6K) all containing the Cys218 in the ATP-binding pocket (56). | A recent study showed a structural analysis of MAP2K7 activation and identified small molecules with inhibitory activity (57). | Then, a small-scale screen (360 compounds) using the melting thermal shift assay identified nine compounds that could bind the flexible MAP2K7 ATP binding pocket with KD in the nanomolar range. | These compounds included type I inhibitors (e.g., Ibrutinib, OTSSP167, and CPT1-70-1) and trifluoromethyl-benzene-based type II inhibitors (e.g., HYJ2-002-1, XMD15-46, and TL10-105) (57). | Kinase assays using full-length MAP2K7-S287DT291D protein with ATP pre-incubation showed high potency for the nine identified compounds with IC50 values ranging from 60 nM to 160 nM. | The compounds that showed higher cytotoxicity in the monocytic cell line THP-1 at 1 μM concentration were OTSSP167, CPT1-70-1, and TL10-105. | This report has shed important information on the MAP2K7 structure in the inactive and active form, the flexibility of the ATP binding domain, and the inhibitory activity of Type I and Type II reversible and covalent inhibitors. | JNK inhibitors (e.g., JNK-IN-8) showed cytotoxicity in T-ALL cell lines with IC50 10 μM by inhibiting the MAP2K7-JNK pathway (58, 59). | Selective inhibition of the kinase MAP2K7 with small molecules is possible because of the distinct features of its ATP binding pocket compared to other MAP2Ks (61, 62). | 5Z-7-Oxozeaenol synergistically induces in vitro cytotoxicity with etoposide and dexamethasone, suggesting the feasibility of using this inhibitor in frontline therapy. | However, this compound failed to efficiently control leukemia in the cell-based xenograft (CBX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models due to drug toxicity that prevented achieving therapeutic concentrations in vivo (64). | We recently found that the MELK inhibitor OTSSP167 also inhibited MAP2K7 kinase activity at an IC50 of 160 nM and induced cytotoxicity in T-ALL cells at low nanomolar concentrations (IC50 10-57 nM) through inhibition of the MAP2K7-JNK pathway in T-ALL cell lines (57, 65). | Despite being a pan-kinase inhibitor, OTSSP167 targeted other pathways besides MAP2K7-JNK, such as mTOR and NOTCH1, in T-ALL cells (65). | Yet, despite being potent and well tolerated, future use of OTSSP167 in the clinic is somehow overshadowed by the potential of target toxicity due to its pan-kinase inhibitor activity. | Recently, covalent MAP2K7 inhibitors were identified in a high-throughput nanomole-scale synthesis for late-stage functionalization of acrylamide-based kinase inhibitors ( Table 3 ) (66). | Two MAP2K7 inhibitors (compounds 1 and 2), previously identified via structure-based drug discovery and virtual screening, were used to generate libraries through copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition synthesis that were screened with the in-cell western assay (phosphorylated JNK detection) using U2O2 cells (osteosarcoma) treated with sorbitol. | The generated series from compounds 1 and 2 yielded derivatives (4-amino-pyrazolpyrimidine core and indazole scaffold) with JNK inhibition capacity in the low nanomolar range (30 nM) and irreversible binding to the Cys 218 in the recombinant protein. | Although the top inhibitors in each series were selected for absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies, none of these compounds were tested in mouse models. | Finally, Scheidts group designed a novel MAP2K7 inhibitor, DK-2403, based on rational design with a streamlined one-pot synthesis (67). | In recent years, significant efforts have been dedicated to developing novel MAP2K7 inhibitors for use as research tools and potential new cancer treatments. | Among the nine small molecules with MAP2K7 inhibitory capacity described in the literature, only four were evaluated in cancer models, predominantly multiple melanoma and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and three were assessed in mouse models. | Our research group identified abnormal MAP2K7 activation in pediatric T-ALL and conducted proof-of-concept evaluations of 5Z-7Oxozeaenol and OTSSP167 compounds. | Although promising results indicated that MAP2K7 inhibition can control leukemia burden in preclinical mouse models, the compounds did not exhibit the desired high potency, high specificity, and low toxicity. | More recently, we described the design and synthesis of an irreversible MAP2K7 inhibitor, DK2403, with high specificity that has yet to be investigated in pre-clinical mouse models. | The clinical application of potent and specific MAP2K7 inhibitors in leukemia also requires optimal pharmacology and toxicology studies in animal models and pre-clinical evaluation using patient samples. | Undesired activity in the central nervous system could be minimized by decreasing the lipophilicity of lead compounds or devising delivery systems that are not permeable in the blood-brain barrier. | For all these reasons, Phase I clinical trials should examine the safety and adverse events of MAP2K7 inhibitors, particularly in cognition, cardiac function, and immunity. | Another alternative to overcome these shortcomings is repurposing existing kinase inhibitors tested in humans for new therapeutic purposes, although this would imply off-target inhibition of MAP2K7 (low potency). | A clearer understanding of MAP2K7s role in normal and disease states and the development of small-molecule inhibitors will facilitate the exploration of potential clinical applications in cancer and other diseases.","MA (MISC), ##2K (MISC), c (MISC), Jun (MISC), J (MISC), J (ORG), ##N (MISC), ##K (ORG), MA (MISC), ##K (MISC), MA (MISC), ##2K

11664001.xml,Understanding Post-COVID-19: Mechanisms, Neurological Complications, Current Treatments, and Emerging Therapies,"Cell dysmetabolism has also been the subject of recent reviews that explore its association with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as prion disease, Alzheimers, and Parkinsons disease.1618Recent observations suggest that mitochondria, beyond their role in cellular metabolism, actively transfer between cells to repair loss of function and may even play a crucial role in immune regulation.1923 Extracellular mitochondria can have regenerative effects when they act as activators of immune cells in order to dispose of damaged cells.24 On the other hand damaged mitochondria have been found to have a tight link with the etiology of neurological proteinopathies.1618 The essential functions of mitochondria, both within and outside the cell, along with their diversity in our bodies, tissue-specific physiology, and ability to transfer between cells, could be pivotal in understanding the diverse symptoms of PACS, where mitochondria may exert a significant influence.2527 We believe that targeting cellular metabolism or metabolic homeostasis could also be a key element in producing new therapeutic agents. | In addition, specific mitochondrial proteins in NDEVs, such as subunit 6 of respiratory chain complex I, subunit 10 of complex III, and the neuroprotective proteins Humanin and MOTS-c, were significantly reduced in PACS patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms, but not in those without these symptoms, relative to controls. | Due to high levels of ROS and inflammation seen in brain damage we suggest that supplementation such as Tempol (a synthetic antioxidant compound that mimics the activity of superoxide dismutase, an enzyme that naturally protects cells from oxidative stress by neutralizing superoxide radicals). | AntioxidantVitamin Supplemental Therapy Excessive reactive nitrogen species and ROS can be formed when there is brain injury.92 Subsequently, this can lead to secondary brain damage along with lipid peroxidation, and inflammatory mediators.92 Endogenous enzymes (Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx)) and non-enzymatic molecules such as Reduced Glutathione (GSH), melatonin, and coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone), aid in keeping free radicals in a homeostatic state.93,94 Nevertheless, using supplementation through diet or medication is crucial in both the prevention and treatment of pathologies.92 One study by Yang et al studied the effects of multifunctional antioxidant treatment, such as Tempol at 200 mgkgd to mice via subcutaneously implanted osmotic mini-pumps and found promising results in regards to neuroinflammation.95 Tempol is a superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic, as well as a free-radical scavenger derived from peroxynitrite that is able to reduce hydroxyl radicals.95 The authors found that there was a 2 fold decrease in titers in IL-1, IL-2, Interferon-Gamma (IFN-γ), and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-α), as well as a decrease in the activation of Nuclear Factor Kappa-Light-Chain-Enhancer of Activated B Cells (NF-κB) in the optic nerve.95 Similarly, it has been reported that antioxidant vitamins have a positive role in neurogenesis.96 Vitamin A, which is involved in cell cycle regulation and cell proliferation has been associated with cognitive impairments in executive function and memory when a deficiency exists.96 While vitamin C has a role in neurite outgrowth and cell maturation, therefore, it is not surprising that its supplementation has been reported to improve attention, language, and memory abilities.96 Vitamin D has also been found to improve hippocampal neurogenesis and cognition in male wild-type and transgenic AD-like mice.97 Through Y-maze tests, the authors were able to report improved working memory in comparison to control.97 Similarly, vitamin E is involved in cell proliferation, and its supplementation aids in the preservation of attention, perceptualmotor speed, memory, and language.96 Polyphenols and polyphenol-rich whole foods can have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.98 Foods such as blueberries, strawberries, and grape seed extract have been known to increase and promote neurogenesis.98 Resveratrol, found in peanuts, tree nuts, grapes, cocoa, and wine have also been found to activate sirtuin 1 which can induce neurogenesis.98 Furthermore, it has been proposed that antioxidants can even help reduce the severity of neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntingtons disease, via the promotion of functional neurogenesis and neuroprotection.99 Therefore, it is interesting to suggest that antioxidants and vitamin supplements can have a beneficial effect in PACS patients and it indirectly attacks the secondary effects that SARS-CoV-2 can have in the CNS as well as stimulate neurogenesis (Figure 3). | Patients that suffer from fatigue due to PACS could benefit from an array of treatment options such as vitamin C combined with L-Arginine, and apheresis.7578 However, non pharmaceutical options such as physical rehabilitation have also been shown to improve symptoms of PACS patients.79 This is similar to supportive treatment in regards to neurological affectations of PACS, where the mainstay method of treating patients is through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).80 However, other authors mention that by reducing free radicals and oxidative stress, generated by compounds such as anthranilic acid, cognitive function could improve in PACS patients.82 It is also important to note that new research has been carried out on pharmaceuticals such lithium and fluoxetine due to their metabolic role in the mitochondria and their antioxidant effect84,85.86 Similarly, other researchers tried to explore the role of drugs like Dextroamphetamine-amphetamine, Naltrexone, Montelukast,

11664153.xml,The endocannabinoid system in the brain undergoes long-lasting changes following neuropathic pain,"CB1Rs mediate retrograde signals that result in short-term synaptic plasticity, known as depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) or depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE), and long-term depression (LTD) at excitatory and inhibitory synapses.8,9 The ECS participates in neuropathic pain The changes in the ECS associated with neuropathic pain are summarized in Table 1. | For example, the levels of AEA and 2-AG are elevated in pain-related brain regions such as the PAG, rostral ventral medulla (RVM), and lateral entorhinal cortex in chronic neuropathic pain models.10 The increased eCB levels might be related to increased biosynthesis or decreased metabolism and serve as endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms. | The neuroprotective effects of eCB alterations may be related to changes in neuronal excitability and transmission. | The activities of the vesicle-associated protein Rab3B and downstream Rab3-interacting molecule 1α (RIM1α) are inhibited following the reduction in PKA activity, leading to decreased GABA release.11 DSE and DSI modulate presynaptic neurotransmitter release by suppressing either inhibitory or excitatory neuron excitability. | The short-term influence of the ECS in balancing excitatory and inhibitory transmission might underlie the hyperexcitability of the brain following neuropathic pain. | Selective inhibition of the ZIv-Po circuit or administration of cannabinoids in the Po of the thalamus ameliorated pathological pain.41 In addition, thalamic reticular nucleus projections to the ventroposterior region of the thalamus are responsible for hyperalgesia caused by chronic sleep disruption-induced chronic pain.42 More importantly, inhibitory effects have been observed in this pathway. | The activation of CB1Rs increases the disinhibition on the RAIC and produces analgesia via strengthening the descending pain inhibitory pathway (②). | As a result, the inhibitory action of the PAG-RVM pathway on nociceptive signals is strengthened (⑤). | The majority of CB1Rs are expressed in the terminals of GABAergic neurons in the mPFC.49 The inhibitory effect of GABAergic neurons on excitatory neurons is suppressed by the ECS through presynaptic CB1Rs. For example, a double immunoelectron microscopy study on the rodent mPFC revealed that CB1Rs in GABAergic neurons are associated with postsynaptic mGluR5 in pyramidal neurons.50 The activation of mGluR5 plays an important role in the change in glutamatergic signaling into retrograde eCB signaling. | In the long-lasting phase of neuropathic pain, increased eCB levels lead to CB1R dysfunction, breaking the feedback loop and resulting in uncontrolled inhibitory inputs from GABAergic neurons, suppressing mPFC function and leading to depression.17 Glutamatergic neurons in the mPFC and serotonergic neurons in the prelimbic mPFC are involved in mood disorders.53 Exogenous cannabinoids such as cannabidiol (CBD) produce antidepressive effects in the prelimbic mPFC through CB1Rs and serotonergic receptors.54 These findings suggest that cannabinoid and non-cannabinoid receptors of different neurons contribute to regulating anxiety and depression following neuropathic pain. | The antinociceptive effect of activated CB1Rs in the RAIC depend on the disinhibition of GABAergic neurons and the enhanced function of the descending pain inhibitory pathway via the dorsolateral fasciculus (Figure 4A).22 Despite these varying changes in CB1Rs, the neural mechanisms underlying the analgesic effects of activated CB1Rs in the IC warrant further investigation. | The central and peripheral manifestations of anxiety and depression are mediated by CB1R and CB2R signaling, indicating that the ECS is a crucial regulator of these conditions in neuropathic pain.83 Emotional aspects of neuropathic pain, such as fear and anxiety, are processed through a neural circuit from the ventral hippocampus (VH) to the BLA.84 AEA levels in the hippocampus increased after systemic injection of the FAAH inhibitor URB597, which inhibited both depressive-like behaviors and neuropathic pain.33 This antidepressant effect is enhanced by the activation of CB2Rs and TRPV1 receptors by AEA.85 The application of PEA can indirectly increase AEA levels by acting as a false substrate for FAAH, potentially having a positive cooperative effect on neuropathic pain and related emotional disorders.86 Through double immunostaining and electron microscopy, CB1Rs of hippocampal astrocytes were identified and quantified.87 Acute application of exogenous cannabinoids triggered LTD at hippocampal CA3CA1 synapses. | Midcingulate cortex (MCC) In addition to the ACC, the MCC plays important roles in emotion, action, memory and pain.104 Nociceptive information from the anteromedial thalamic nucleus arrives at the MCC.105 In naive mice, chemogenetic activation of the MCC aggravates pain sensitivity.106 Moreover, hypersensitivity to pain is associated with the MCC-IC pathway.107 In addition, the connections between the MCC and the ZI lead to inhibitory effects.108 Poor episodic memory performance, executive function, speed and mental flexibility are associated with the MCC in Parkinsons disease patients.109 This poor performance is associated with lower CB1R levels in the MCC.109 Phytocannabinoids such as THC and CBD significantly reduce connectivity between the DLPFC and the IC.110 The distribution and physiological function of the ECS in the MCC should be explored. | Cannabis-based medicines are derived from plants and act as agonists to CBRs. The activation of CBRs by phytocannabinoids or synthetic cannabinoids may help relieve neuropathic pain.114 Pharmacological approaches such as the use of CBRs agonists, eCB-regulating enzyme inhibitors, and other interventions that modulate the ECS have been shown to relieve neuropathic pain.115 Short-term and long-term changes in ECS components in the brain can occur after neuropathic pain.","EC (ORG), EC (MISC), EC (ORG), CBR (MISC), CB (MISC), CB (MISC), EC (MISC), EC (ORG)"
11664163.xml,The role of the FKBP51–Hsp90 complex in Alzheimer’s disease: An emerging new drug target,"Consequently, there has been an increase in research activity toward finding small molecules that can re-balance the chaperone and co-chaperone machinery to counter the effects of disease resulting from old age. | The significance of deranged expression of HSPs and various chaperones in AD cases has been reported,78, 79, 80 and it has been shown that 17-AAG, an Hsp90 ATPase inhibitor, can attenuate Aβ toxicity and prevent memory loss in the Tg2576 transgenic AD mice model.81 In this mouse model, inhibition of Hsp90 improved synaptic markers and density, in vivo long-term potentiation, and memory loss.81, 82 It appears this effect was mediated by activation of HSF1, which in turn upregulated synaptic genes. | It was suggested that HSF1, APP, and Aβ peptide may form a self-regulating system that counters the deleterious effects of Aβ on synaptic function.83 Furthermore, most recently, the small-molecule allosteric activator of the ATPase activity of Hsp90, the dihydropyridine LA1011, was shown to decrease Aβ plaque, and tau aggregates in the APPxPS1 AD mice model.23, 84, 85 Furthermore, it should be noted that, although PIN1 does not itself appear to be an Hsp90-dependent client protein, its catalytic activity is modulated by phosphorylation at Ser 16, thus preventing it from interacting with its target motif,86 and significantly, it appears that the Hsp90-dependent kinase, protein kinase A, is responsible for inactivating PIN1.86, 87, 88, 89 Thus, a decrease in Hsp90 activity could impact indirectly on the isomerase activity of PIN1 by preventing its inhibition, which would favor dephosphorylation at the pSer 262-Pro motif and downregulation of tau phosphorylation as a whole. | HSP-induced microglial activation appears to induce cytokine production ((Interleukin-6) IL-6 and (Tumor necrosis factor alpha)TNF-α), thus providing neuroprotection by increasing phagocytosis and clearance of Aβ peptides.90, 91 The mechanism by which microglial activation occurs by exogenous HSPs is thought to involve NF-kB and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways mediated by Toll-like receptor 4 activation. | Aha1 was identified as an activator of Hsp90 ATPase activity and as such affects the dwell time of the Hsp90 chaperone cycle and therefore the chaperoning of client proteins.134, 135 Aha1 is known to localize with tau NFT in human AD tissue.136 In vitro, a combination of Hsp90 and Aha1 dramatically induces tau fibrillation in the presence of ATP, and it was noted that such tau aggregation was greater than for a Hsp90FKBP51 combination. | Interestingly, the Aha1-binding inhibitor KU-177 dramatically decreased tau aggregation in vitro. | In vivo, the overexpression of Aha1 in the rTG4510 tau transgenic AD mouse model dramatically increases aggregated tau, leading to both neuronal loss and cognitive impairment.136 A similar study also showed that overexpression of Aha1 increased pathological tau levels in 16-month-old wild-type mice and impaired associative learning.137 Furthermore, similar studies with a C-terminal-binding inhibitor, SWE84, of Aha1 preferentially cleared phosphorylated and aggregated prone tau.138 It may be significant that Aha1 levels are induced in AD brain tissue while they are slightly repressed in aged tissue.94, 136 Hsp90 also associates with the peptidylprolyl isomerase (PPIase) immunophilins, FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51), and FKBP52 and with cyclophilin 40 (Cyp40, also known as peptidylprolyl isomerase D).42 Cyp40 is thought to provide a neuroprotective function since it was recently shown to disaggregate tau fibrils in vitro and, significantly, to prevent toxic tau accumulation in vivo.139 Unfortunately, Cyp40 expression levels not only decrease with age; they are repressed in AD.42, 94 In contrast, FKBP52 induces tau aggregation by a mechanism that involves a direct molecular interaction with truncated and wild-type tau.140, 141 Elevated levels of FKBP52 have been shown to increase pathological tau in 16-month-old wild-type mice, to cause defects in cognitive flexibility during spatial learning, and to evoke a neuroinflammatory response.137 Fortunately, FKBP52 levels appear to be lower in the cortex of AD patient brains, and it appears that FKBP52 is not a major driver of tau pathology in this case.94, 122 Unlike FKBP52, FKBP51 levels not only progressively increase with age but further increases are seen in AD patients.42, 94, 121, 125 Stress, which is also associated with AD, is also known to increase FKBP51 levels.142, 143 FKBP51 was shown to be able to preserve toxic tau oligomers in vivo25 and decreased tau levels are found in the brain of mice lacking FKBP51.110, 121 Elevated FKBP51 levels, therefore, seem to be a prime factor that may be able to elicit a tauopathy. | Consequently, there is a drive toward developing small molecules that can restore age-related decline in proteostasis or to develop Hsp90 inhibitors that promote the degradation of tau.92, 154, 155 Toward restoring an age-related decline in proteostasis, the dihydropyridine, LA1011, was selected on the basis of its Hsp co-inducing effect (enhanced induction above an already induced state) and its favorable toxicological data.84 Remarkably, a 6-month treatment plan of LA1011 administration improved the spatial learning and memory functions in wild-type mice and eliminated neurodegeneration in the APPxPS1 double mutant mouse model. | Alternatively, small molecules that inhibit FKBP51 directly, either inhibiting its PPIase activity or blocking its TPR domain form binding to Hsp90, could be developed.157 It is noteworthy that there is evidence that FK506 has been shown to reduce Aβ and tau levels in the hippocampus and cortex of 3xTg-AD mice.158 Unfortunately, FK506 displays adverse side effects.159 Concluding remarks and future directions There is growing evidence that AD is a result of an imbalance in the homeostatic processes that regulate APP, Aβ peptides, and tau.33, 34, 119, 120 Hsp90 is emerging as a central regulator of tau pathology, and many of its co-chaperones influence or regulate tau proteostasis. | The most important appears to be FKBP51, an immunophilin that is known to stabilize tau and whose expression is known to increase, not only due to stress or damage of brain tissue but a factor known to be elevated in AD tissue.42 Recent work has shown that a small molecule, a dihydropyridine known as LA1011, was able to eliminate neurodegeneration in the APPxPS1 double mutant AD mouse model.84 LA1011 was shown to be an activator of the Hsp90 ATPase activity and also a competitive inhibitor against FKBP51 binding to Hsp90.23, 85 It appears that LA1011 may be able to restore the homeostatic mechanism of the Hsp90FKBP51 complex such that tau phosphorylation returns toward a normal balanced level, thus avoiding tau hyperphosphorylation.","Alzheimers (MISC), AD (MISC), Hsp90 (MISC), FK (MISC), AD (MISC), FK (MISC), H (MISC), FK (MISC), FK (MISC), FK (MISC), H (MISC), AD (MISC), FK (MISC), ##10 (MISC), H (MISC), AD (MISC), AD (MISC), Alzheimer (MISC), AD (MISC)"

11664286.xml,Recent advances in potential enzymes and their therapeutic inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease,"Meanwhile, enzymes and their inhibitors have become the focus of research in AD treatment. | Early inhibitors were used for characterizing and labeling the γ-secretase complex containing PSEN1. | But poor drug qualities of these compounds lead scientists to use a wide variety of small molecule γ-secretase modulators (GSMs). | At earlier stages of AD progression, histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1 inhibitors such as trichostatin A and valproic acid (VA) upregulate the NEP level and increase its activity. | Several unexpected candidates have been introduced as potential enzyme inhibitors. | Recent research reveals a biological connection between homocysteine (Hcy) and detoxifying enzymes such as PON1, BLMH, and BPHL, suggesting their involvement in AD .The significance of this topic is highlighted by a recent study focusing on bioactive compounds produced by microalgae and cyanobacteria, which exhibit enzyme inhibitory effects to AD . | Our search terms included Alzheimers disease, Target enzymes in AD, Enzyme inhibitors, Clinical studies in AD, Multi-target drugs in AD. | Original research articles exploring the role of enzymes in AD and studies discussing various inhibitors targeting these enzymes. | Additionally, we provide a comprehensive review of the enzymes associated with AD and the latest advancements in developing enzyme inhibitors for therapeutic applications, highlighting several recent studies and clinical trials focused on these inhibitors. | From analyzed data, the correlation between APOE4 and reduction of neprilysin, plasmin, plasminogen activators (uPA and tPA), and ECE-2 insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) has been suggested as markers in the AD onset . | Numerous medical approaches targeting these pathological processes have shown promise in preclinical and clinical trials, particularly those involving ChE inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, secretase modulators, xanthine oxidase inhibitors, and sirtuins. | That is the reason why secretase inhibitors are widely used in AD drug development. | Rivastigmine is a pseudo irreversible carbamate inhibitor which stimulates the activation of both the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and protein kinase B (Akt) which regulate ADAM-9, -10, and 17 and also reduces Aβ production . | showed a high rate of secreted-frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1) in detergent extracts of entorhinal and frontal cortex from AD patients which are common as endogenous ADAM10 inhibitors. | MK8931 is a BACE1 inhibitor that reduces Aβ peptide production in animal models. | The great efficiency of TTP-854 (HPP854), the other inhibitor of mild AD, has been approved in phase I of a clinical trial. | Other inhibitors like AZD3839 (LY3314814) interact with the ion channel and decrease levels of CSF . | Cleavage in the cytoplasmic terminal of APP (CT31) induces the neuroprotective effect of neuregulin-1 (NRG1) and decreases apoptosis and cytotoxicity in SH-SY5. | γ-secretase small-molecule inhibitors (GSIs) effectively decrease Aβ production in vivo but high toxicity is the main concern of using these drugs. | APP-α is generated by α-secretase and has neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties . | In the apoptosis process, Pin1 and SIRT1 act as neuroprotective factors in amyloid deposition, reducing and recreating amyloid surrogate protein. | Multiple activators of SIRT1 are being tested for a variety of pathologies. | One of these natural activators of SIRT1 is a polyphenol that is present in virgin olive oil, oleuropein aglycone (OLE). | That is the reason HDAC inhibitors have shown promising results in clinical trials . | HA contributes to Aβ cytotoxicity through the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress leading to the suppression of the Sirt1proliferator-activated receptor coactivator 1 (PGC1ɑ) pathway. | Taurine, a naturally occurring β-amino acid in the brain, has been demonstrated to have neuroprotective properties. | The other natural cysteine protease inhibitor is Cystatin C (CysC) which inhibits SIRT1 and decreases Aβ40 secretion in microvascular endothelial brain cells. | This evidence suggested that SIRT2 inhibitors could play a vital role as a potential drug target for AD. | For example, Allosteric modulators with hydrophobic pockets might potentially be a new drug in the design of SIRT2 inhibitors. | In the sporadic rat model, the AK-1 inhibitor increases α-tubulin acetylation and degrades the Aβ aggregates. | It is the general inhibitor of SIRT2 . | Moreover, it was reported that SIRT3 controls many neuroprotective factors, such as ketones, sesamin, and resveratrol . | Nicotinamide riboside is one of the activators of SIRT3 that reduces DNA damage in hippocampal neurons by decreasing tau protein . | 3.2.4 SIRT4 SIRT4 is an ADP-ribosyltransferase located on the 12q24.23-q24.31 chromosomes with weak deacetylase ability but also with high inhibitory effects on glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) of mitochondria and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex. | Glas et al demonstrated that balsalazide could be a selective drug as SIRT5 inhibitor in AD . | Da Kalbas et al found 3-arylthiosuccinylated and 3-benzylthiosuccinylated peptide derivatives as the new SIRT5 inhibitors . | Several natural products such as Quercetin, Luteolin, Delphinidin, and Fucoidan are SIRT6 activators. | Further research should be performed to characterize these natural compounds and their derivatives for the treatment of AD . | The inhibitor or substrate bind to the active site located at the b-sheet and helix-rich domain . | In addition, a bipartite outer chamber of MAO-B with an inner cavity causes more selectivity than MAO-A in reaction with inhibitors . | All of these characteristics of MAOs, inspire scientists to find MAOs inhibitors for various disorders such as AD. | Hydrozine-based inhibitors like iproniazid and phenelzine were first studied as an antidepressant. | Rasagiline and safinamide, the irreversible MAO-B inhibitors, and resveratrol as the MAO-A inhibitor were used in phase II clinical trials of AD. | However, ladostigil and diphenyl pyrimidines, the combination of MAO and AChE inhibitors, influence antidepressant and anxiolytic activity . | Several natural products are used as MAO-A and MAO-B inhibitors for the treatment of AD . | A combination of natural inhibitors affects different enzymes. | For example, coumarintacrine hybrids are natural effective inhibitors of AchE and MAO . | On the other hand, the use of a significant number of structurally distinct synthetic inhibitors, like minerals with fewer side effects and selective inhibition, is increasing . | Related to these studies MAO inhibitors have broad-reaching cellular and pericellular effects (Fig. | The plan of either repurposing existing or developing novel synthetic MAO inhibitors is a promising and exciting area of investigation .Fig. | Two classifications of xanthine oxidase inhibitors, purine-like and non-purine XO inhibitors, affect XO activity. | Allopurinol is the class of purine-like XO inhibitors that decreases high levels of uric acid in cancer medication and reduces endothelial dysfunction and platelet aggregation in cardiovascular diseases . | Febuxostat and topiroxostat are two non-purine inhibitors that are used currently for the treatment of hyperuricemia , , . | Natural inhibitors are vastly studied about XOD inhibition , , . | About flavonols, quercetin - 3 -Me, persicarin, and apigenin, without glycosyl group, show a strong XOD inhibitory effect . | Donepezil (derived from indanone base), galantamine, and physostigmine are three traditional AchE inhibitors. | These two compound lead to high ligand efficiency and beneficial inhibitory effect in both in vivo and in vitro. | The main structure of these inhibitors include condensed aromatic cores with quaternary ammonium or nitrogen . | One of the first successful achievements in the synthesis of hybrid compounds was the development of heptylene linked bis- (6-chloro)-which has a potency 3000 times higher than the tacrine in inhibiting AChE . | designed the effective quinolinrone-tacrine compound by replacing naphthoquinone scaffold with 2, 5, 8-quinolinetrione. | This new compound showed low hepatotoxicity and good anti-amyloid aggregation properties . | Tolserine and phenserine are new generations of ChE inhibitors. | Galangin is a flavonoid with a potent inhibitory effect on AchE, but human clinical trials are required. | In hybrid groups, donepezil-tacrine and tacrine-ferulic acid (T6FA) have shown a great inhibitory effect on both AchE and BuChE activity . | Tunicamycin as PKR inhibitor attenuates neural cell apoptosis. | Some studies have demonstrated that COMT inhibitors, such as Entacapone and Tolcapone, can block Aβ fibril formation in the treatment of AD . | 4 Enzymes inhibitors in AD In 2012, it was demonstrated that natural inhibitors such as curcumin can inhibit the activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), the protein kinase responsible for phosphorylating c-Jun at Ser-63 and Ser-73, induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) lesions. | Furthermore, another study identified JNK-IN-8 as a selective JNK inhibitor that prevents the phosphorylation of c-Jun, a direct substrate of JNK . | studied a new JNK 3 inhibitor, 2-aryl-1-pyrimidinyl-1H-imidazole-5-yl acetonitrile, which is able in improving cognitive memory in APPPSEN1 and the 3xTg mouse model . | Tideglusib is a non-ATP competitive, irreversible inhibitor of GSK3β, representing a significant challenge in the treatment of AD . | Non-peptidic anti-aggregate drugs, including tramiprosate, clioquinol (PBT1), and second-generation inhibitors of metal-induced Aβ aggregation (PBT2), have demonstrated promising results in Phase II clinical trials by enhancing Aβ degradation . | The only inhibitor for Erk12 is FR-180204. | Reduction of Aβ levels are obtained with secretase inhibitors in line with exogenous monomeric Aβ show neuroprotective potential by decreasing cell death. | Some medicinal compounds may act on multiple tau kinases, providing a good opportunity as AD inhibitors .Table 3The Secretases

inhibitor, blocks Fyn kinase and the stem cell factor (SCFc-Kit) signaling pathway through mast cell-microglia interactions, playing a role in the neuroinflammatory process . | Inhibitors of the Srcabl family of kinases (Saracatinib and thiamet-G) show the same inhibitory effect on Fyn kinase for mild-to-moderate AD . | A group of sirtuin-activating compounds (STACs) (e.g., resveratrol, polyphenol, quercetin, curcumin, and kaempferol) causes a significant increase in sirtuin ratios. | Both reversible and irreversible inhibitors of MAOs are currently used as therapeutics of AD. | The long-lasting irreversible inhibitors as antidepressant agents such as isocarboxazid and tranylcypromine increase NE in neurons but inevitably induce hypertensive reactions. | L-deprenyl (selegiline) is effective inhibitor which inhibit MAO-B activity, exclusively effecting distance between phenolic group and N-terminal of c-Jun in JNK1 . | Research has shown that Cabergoline, an agonist of dopamine D2-like receptors, offers neuroprotective benefits against oxidative stress. | Hydrangea, another noncompetitive inhibitor, inhibits AChE and BuChE activity . | Further, the inhibitory effect of hybrid donepezilAP2238 has been shown on AChE and A toxicity, but human toxicology studies are still being conducted. | Some natural product-based inhibitors like Thymohydroquinone and Carvacrol are two constituents of aromatic plants that have a strong AChE inhibitory effect and their related clinical trials have been successfully performed. | Current AD therapeutics utilizing MTDs, such as AChE inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists, are expected to provide a more effective approach by binding to various enzymes and receptors. | New compounds based on 1,2,4-thiadiazole combined with tacrine demonstrate efficient inhibition of ChEs, particularly exerting a dominant effect on BuChE, while simultaneously blocking two binding sites on the NMDA receptor . | Ladostigil is an advanced example of an MTDs currently in Phase II clinical trials, demonstrating inhibitory effects on both MAO-B and AChE enzymes simultaneously . | The ChE inhibitory activity is primarily attributed to the Rivastigmine (RIV) moiety, while the anti-Aβ aggregation and antioxidant effects are mainly ascribed to the Benzimidazole (BIM) moiety . | The inhibitor of various enzyme isoforms are listed in Table

therapeutic use. | Meanwhile, enzyme inhibitors with the most effective in AD have shown important challenges in therapeutic strategies. | The serious toxicities associated with synthetic inhibitors have resulted in the discontinuation of several clinical studies. | Consequently, specific compounds are being developed to mitigate the adverse effects of these inhibitors. | The conflicting studies

11664333.xml,Cognitive-enhancing effect of Cordia dichotoma fruit on scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment in rats: metabolite profiling, in vivo, and in silico investigations†,"These conditions result in neurodegeneration and a loss of synapses and neurons, which results in the macroscopic atrophy of the brain areas related to memory, such as the hippocampus.4 Cholinergic neurons release acetylcholine (ACh), a neurotransmitter that has a role in signal transduction linked to memory and learning.6 Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors raise synaptic ACh levels, allowing the signal to be potentiated, thus improving cognition and everyday functioning.4 So, methods that lower the high level of AChE are thought to be effective for treating memory problems.7 Additionally, noradrenaline (NA) and dopamine (DA) are crucial neuromodulators involved in cognitive functions and are related to the psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia.8 Concerning AD treatments, current anti-AD drugs, such as donepezil (DON), rivastigmine, galantamine, and memantine, help alleviate clinical symptoms. | In this regard, several natural products have gained interest in the pharmaceutical industry and the scientific research community due to their neuroprotective effects, targeting different pathological pathways related to AD.4 Cordia dichotoma G. | In this study, CDFME was profiled by untargeted LC-QTOF-MS-MS metabolomics in both negative and positive electrospray ionization (ESI) modes to characterize its bioactive compounds, and its total phenolics content (TPC) and total flavonoids content (TFC) were determined. | To gain insights into the potential AChE inhibitory activity of the most abundant metabolites identified in CDFME, molecular docking studies were conducted, comparing their binding affinity for AChE with that of DON. | Finally, the stability within the enzyme active site of the most potentially AChE inhibitory metabolites was evaluated using molecular dynamics and molecular mechanics methods. | CDFME samples were analyzed in both positive and negative ESI modes, using an Agilent Technologies Zorbax SB-C18 column with dimensions of 150 mm LT 2.1 mm ID, 5 μm particle size, and 90 Å pore diameter, and an optimized acetonitrile: water gradient (both with 0.1 vv of formic acid) that enabled the comprehensive profiling of CDFME compounds within 25 minutes. | Detailed information about the separation conditions, MS, and MSMS measurements, as well as data processing, was as described in a previous work.18,22 Detected compounds were identified as metabolites based on their predicted molecular formula, accurate molecular mass, retention time (Rt), and MSMS spectra, and by comparison with various databases (e.g., KEGG, https:www.genome.jpkeggcompound, the Phytochemical Dictionary of Natural Product Database, https:dnp.chemnetbase.comfaceschemicalChemicalSearch.xhtml, Mass Bank of North America, https:mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu, and PubChem, https:pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), in addition to other literary sources. | 2.9 Molecular docking The 18 most abundant metabolites identified in CDFME were docked against the AChE target receptor using the Schrödinger 2021 suite.25 As reference standards, DON and the co-crystallized inhibitor were used. | The chemical structures of these compounds were sketched with ChemDraw Professional 17.0 (Cambridge Soft Corporation., Cambridge, USA). | The enzyme structure was subjected to correction, 3D hydrogenation, and energy minimization procedures.27 A standardized docking procedure was conducted using the default program specifications.28 The ideal binding pose for each examined compound was selected based on criteria like root mean square deviation (RMSD), score, and binding mode. | Additionally, a validation check for the applied force field was performed by redocking the co-crystallized ligand of AChE (DON) inside AChE binding site.29 The valid performance was verified by achieving a low RMSD value (2 Å) and close similarities between the binding modes of both the native and redocked poses of the co-crystallized inhibitor of AChE. | Metabolites displaying the highest binding scores, indicative of their potential as AChE inhibitors, were further evaluated by molecular dynamics and molecular mechanics methods. | The complexes of rosmarinic acid, caffeoyl-4-hydroxyphenyllactate, sebestenoid C, and sagerinic acid with the AChE receptor were subjected to a 200 ns simulation.30 As a reference, the co-crystallized inhibitor (DON) complex was used. | Results and discussion 3.1 Total phenolics and total flavonoids contents Phenolic compounds are important plant components with significant redox properties. | The hydroxyl groups in the structures of these compounds are essential in enabling the scavenging of free radicals, thereby contributing to their antioxidant activity.31 TPC and TFC values were determined to complement the metabolite profiling by LC-QTOF-MSMS, as the phenolic contents of plant extracts have been linked to the enhancement of anti-AChE activity.9 The TPC and TFC values in CDFME were

The annotated metabolites (Table 2) pertained to numerous classes encompassing: 17 phenolic acids, 5 organic acids, 5 lignans, 3 coumarins, 5 amino acids, 12 fatty acids and their derivatives, 16 fatty acid amides, 3 polar lipids, 4 terpenoids, and 11 other compounds. | 3.2.1 Phenolic acids and their derivatives Phenolic acids are compounds having one or more hydroxyl groups andor methoxy groups and a carboxylic acid function at the benzene ring. | Phenolic compounds play an essential role in the resistance of plants and the control of physiological processes.32 They are categorized into monomers and polymers (dimers, trimers, and tetramers) according to the number of phenyl moieties in their structures. | dichotoma fruits are rich with phenolic compounds with antimicrobial and antioxidant activities, suggesting their potential application as preservatives in the food industry.34 In the current research, a total of 17 phenolic acids were identified in negative ESI mode (Fig. | dichotoma fruit.34 Meanwhile, sebestenoid C and nepetoidin B were previously reported in Cordia sebestena fruit.39 3.2.2 Organic acids Organic acids are organic compounds with acidic characteristics, classified according to the number of carboxylic groups. | S16) were identified.32 3.2.6 Fatty acids and their derivatives Fatty acids, consisting of 1224 carbon chains with a COOH group at one end, are essential structural components of lipids, plant cell membranes, and certain bioactive compounds. | They are namely palmitoleic linolenic glucoside (42), palmitic oleic glucoside (47),46 dirhamnosyl linolenic acid (48),55 palmitic acid derivative (51),46 linoleylhydroxamate (57), linoleylhydroxamate isomer (59),56 linolenic acid (62), and linolenic acid isomer (63).32 Unsaturated fatty acids, such as linolenic acid and its derivatives (42, 48, 57, 59, 62, and 63), are vital nutrients with a variety of physiological benefits, including neuroprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory actions.57 Additionally, four fatty acid nitrogenous derivatives were also identified, namely, N-decyl diethanolamine (41), N-decyl diethanolamine (45), lauramine oxide (46), and lauramine oxide isomer (54).54 Many studies have reported the presence of various fatty acids in C. | These compounds produced main fragment ions of and , indicating ammonia and ammonia plus water losses at the carboxamide functional group. | 3.2.9 Terpenoids Terpenoids are a class of natural compounds that are derived from mevalonic acid (MVA), which are made up of a plurality of isoprene (C5) structural units. | Terpenoids demonstrate a broad spectrum of biological properties, including antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, and antiallergic effects.60 Four terpenoid compounds were identified in positive ESI (Fig. | Their fragmentation was characterized by the neutral loss of an acetic acid unit (60 mz), but their exact structure could not be conclusively determined.62 3.2.10 Other phytochemical classes Other compounds, belonging to phytochemicals distinct from those mentioned above, were identified in both positive andor negative ESI modes (Fig. | AChE inhibitors are now considered the most potential medication for AD, as they enhance the viability of ACh in central cholinergic synapses.73 Indeed, one of the main reasons for cholinergic deficits following SCOP administration is the increase in AChE activity and the subsequent decrease in ACh levels.2,65 The results obtained (Table 3 and Fig. | Phenolic compounds, such as caffeic acid, syringic acid, lariciresinol,74 salvianolic acid B, and rosmarinic acid,67 were reported to have a potent anti-AChE effect. | p-Coumaric acid mitigates LPS-induced brain damage and decreases AChE level in the brains of mice.66 Coumarins have the potential to treat AD and enhance cognitive performance by blocking AChE.75 Moreover, previous research showed that amino acids76 and organic acids such as quinic acid74 exhibited in vitro AChE inhibitory activity. | Likewise, as observed before for ACh, CDFME (200 mg kg1) induced a similar neuroprotective effect to DON, resulting in significant reductions in NA and DA levels compared to the SCOP control group by 53 and 41, respectively. | 3.4.3 Molecular docking The cholinesterase inhibitory activity of the 18 most abundant compounds in CDFME was compared to both DON and the co-crystallized inhibitor, as reference standards. | These values were comparable to those obtained for DON (8.13 kcal mol1) and the co-crystallized inhibitor (7.88 kcal mol1). | As these phenolic acids and lignan showed the best compromise between the abundance in CDFME, the affinity for AChE, and previous literature reports suggesting relevant neuroprotective properties, they were selected for further investigation in this part of our study.80 The 2D and 3D interactions, along with the binding positioning for these four compounds, are depicted in Table 4. | The co-crystallized inhibitor of AChE was stabilized by binding to Ser200, Ala201, Gly118, and Gly119 amino acids. | Based on the above and considering that these four compounds occupied the same binding pocket of the co-crystallized inhibitor, a promising antagonistic activity could be inferred (Table 4). | 3D interactions 3D positioning Rosmarinic acid Caffeoyl-4-hydroxyphenyllactate Sebestenoid C Sagerinic acid 3.4.4 Molecular dynamics simulations The complexes of the four selected compounds with the AChE target receptor (rosmarinic acid, caffeoyl-4-hydroxyphenyllactate, sebestenoid C, and sagerinic acid-1OCE) were subjected to 200 ns molecular dynamics simulations to investigate their stabilities, using as a reference standard the co-crystallized inhibitor (DON) complex (Co-1OCE). | 5 (A) RMSD values of the complexes of the four selected compounds (rosmarinic acid, caffeoyl-4-hydroxyphenyllactate, sebestenoid C, and sagerinic acid) and the co-crystallized inhibitor (DON) with the AChE receptor as a function of the simulation time (200 ns) (B) RMSD values of the ligand-protein bindings for the four selected compounds (rosmarinic acid, caffeoyl-4-hydroxyphenyllactate, sebestenoid C, and sagerinic acid) and the co-crystallized inhibitor (DON) in the complex with the AChE receptor as a function of simulation time (200 ns). | Additionally, the ligands RMSD analysis was conducted to clarify the degree of stability for rosmarinic acid, caffeoyl-4-hydroxyphenyllactate, sebestenoid C, and sagerinic acid compared to that of the co-crystallized inhibitor (DON) (Fig. | The RMSD values for the four compounds fluctuated along the simulation time up to 7.2, 4, 4.5, and 13.5 Å, respectively, compared to the co-crystallized DON (4.8 Å). | 6B) represented that Ser81, Asn85, and Tyr70 amino acids were the most prominent residues involved in interactions with the co-crystallized inhibitor of AChE. | As can be observed in Table 5, all the examined complexes showed superior ΔG binding energies compared to that of the co-crystallized inhibitor complex (46.56 kcal mol1). | This suggested a very promising perspective regarding the AChE inhibitory potential of the examined compounds from CDFME, particularly the phenolic acids; caffeoyl-4-hydroxyphenyllactate and sebestenoid C. | Conclusion In light of the aforementioned findings, CDFME demonstrated the presence of valuable phenolic compounds, coumarins, essential amino acids, and phospholipids, which were reported to have a neuroprotective effect. | Additionally, molecular docking revealed that among the most abundant metabolites, rosmarinic acid, caffeoyl-4-hydroxyphenyllactate, sebestenoid C, and sagerinic acid were found to show the highest binding affinity towards AChE with binding scores of 7.57, 7.38, 8.47, and 7.78 kcal mol1, respectively, compared to DON (8.13 kcal mol1) and the co-crystallized inhibitor (7.88 kcal mol1). | Further research into bioassay-guided separation and quantification of potential active compounds in the fruit extract, as well as their therapeutic evaluation in AD, is advised. | dichotoma fruit methanolic

11664478.xml,Research Progress on the Anti-Liver Cancer Mechanism and Toxicity of Rhubarb Anthraquinone,"Surgery, local destructive therapy and liver transplantation are the most effective treatments for patients with early-stage liver cancer.5 Anti-tumor therapy includes molecularly targeted drug therapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, chemotherapy and so on. | First-line regimens for systemic antitumor therapy include sorafenib, tislelizumab monoclonal antibody, lenvatinib, and donafenib, and combinations include anti-PD1PD-L1 combined with intravenous anti-VEGF drugs (atezolizumab combined with bevacizumab).6 Second-line systemic anti-tumor therapies include regorafenib, apatinib, and ramucirumab.7 In addition, other second-line systemic anti-tumor treatment options include FDA approval of PD-1 in combination with CTLA4 inhibitors (nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab) for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who have progressed after prior sorafenib treatment or who cannot tolerate sorafenib.8 However, the adverse effects of antitumor therapy are numerous and are dominated by nausea, hypertension, diarrhea, malaise, and rash.9,10 With the advancement of technology, the treatment of liver cancer is also advancing. | So far, a series of natural products are being clinically evaluated against cancer, such as polyphenols, Icariin, resveratrol, silybin, saponins (ginsenoside Rg3 and glycyrrhetinic acid), berberine, and the inorganic compound arsenic trioxide. | Modern research believes that rhubarb mainly contains flavonoids, saponins, AQs and other compounds.16 After reviewing the literature, there are no reports on the anti-liver cancer effects of rhubarb flavonoids and saponins, but there are many reports on the anti-liver cancer effects of rhubarb AQs. Therefore, it is speculated that AQs should be the main anti-liver cancer substances of rhubarb. | AQs are a class of natural quinone compounds that are widely found in natural plants. | Modern research shows that AQ compounds have various pharmacological effects, such as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antioxidant, lipid-lowering, and anti-tumor etc.1721 In recent years, the anti-cancer effects of AQ compounds have been widely studied and are considered to be potential therapeutic drugs for lung cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer and other cancers. | Drugs derived from AQ compounds, such as doxorubicin (DOX), Mitoxantrone, epirubicin, idarubicin, and varubicin have been successfully used in the chemotherapy of malignant tumors and solid tumors.22 Rhubarb AQs are mainly including emodin, rhein, chrysophanol, aloe-emodin and physcion and corresponding glycosides.23 Many in vivo and in vitro experiments have confirmed that rhubarb AQs can inhibit the growth of liver cancer cells. | In addition, Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS)MS analysis found that the methanol extract of rhubarb mainly contained 16 components, including AQ, flavonoids and tannin compounds, and a total of 7 AQs were detected.25 The AQs of rhubarb include AQ glycosides and AQ aglycones. | It was found that there are currently many literatures reporting the anti-liver cancer effects of emodin, rhein, chrysophanol, physcion and aloe-emodin among rhubarb AQs.

Emodin(6-Methyl-1,3,8-trihydroxyanthraquinone) is a naturally occurring AQ compound that has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, and anti-cancer pharmacological effects.5557 With the deepening of research on emodin, emodin has also been confirmed to have a variety of hepatoprotective effects, including NAFLD, liver fibrosis, and liver cancer.58 Liver cancer will occur with the progression of NAFLD and liver fibrosis. | Kim Y S et al combined emodin (20 μM) and sorafenib and found that emodin enhances the inhibitory effect of sorafenib in HCC cells in a time-dependent manner, and it can reduce the resistance of liver cancer cells to sorafenib and synergistically increase the stasis phase of HCC cells in the G1 phase. | Its mechanism is related to emodin inhibiting the activity of SREBP-2, thereby inhibiting oncogenic AKT signaling and inactivating the oncogenic transcription factor signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3).31 The anti-liver cancer effect of new preparations made by combining emodin with other drugs is also vary significant. | For example, Li Cs research explored a new pharmaceutical compound β-dihydroartemisinin-emodin (β-DHA -emodin), which can induce HepG-2 cell apoptosis by up-regulating the expression of caspase-389 and Bax and down-regulating the expression of Bcl-2.77 In the process of treating liver cancer, cisplatin will reduce the therapeutic effect due to its drug resistance. | The Anti-Liver Cancer Effect and Mechanism of Rhein Rhein (4,5-dihydroxy-9,10-dioxoanthracene-2-carboxyli acid) is a lipophilic AQ compound with pharmacological effects of hepatoprotective, renal protective, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer and antibacterial activities.8287 The therapeutic mechanism of rhein for liver cancer mainly includes mitochondrial damage and autophagy-mediated apoptosis of liver cancer cells. | The Anti-Liver Cancer Effect and Mechanism of Chrysophanol Chrysophanol (1,8-dihydroxy-3-methylanthracene-9,10-dione) is the most abundant free AQ compound in rhubarb and has anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and neuroprotective effects.100102 There are few studies on chrysophanols anti-liver cancer effect, and its anti-liver cancer mechanism is mainly reflected in affecting the function of mitochondria. | p21 can act as an inhibitor of CDK, reducing the expression of CDK2, cyclin D and thymidylate synthase (TSase) proteins, thereby arresting Hep3B cells in the S phase.46 P21 has been shown to be a key mediator of cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, preventing the transition to G1S,103 and p27 inhibits the activation of the cyclin E-CDK2 complex and plays a key role in the progression of the cell cycle from the G1 phase to the S phase.104 In addition, Xie Yans research found that chrysophanol can induce liver cancer cells death by affecting mitochondrial function, and chrysophanol (50 μmoll, 100 μmoll) can enhance the expression of CyPD protein, which is a molecular component and regulator of mPTP and is involved in the apoptosis process of liver cancer cells.47 The mechanism of chrysophanol anti -liver cancer is shown in Figure 4. | FENG Q, etc., found that 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity (6PGD) expression is increased in different cancer tissues and can promote tumorigenesis.114 The expression of 6PGD is involved in HCC growth and survival and is considered a potential target to overcome HCC resistance to chemotherapy drugs.115 Physcion is an inhibitor of the small molecule 6PGD. | Furthermore, 6PGD inhibition significantly reduced NADP-dependent sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) enzyme activity, and the reduction of SIRT1 activity inhibited the growth and survival of HCC cells.115 Glycolysis was first discovered in HCC cells and is a hallmark of liver cancer, responsible for regulating HCC cells proliferation, immune evasion, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, and drug resistance.117 Pan X P et als study found that physcion (20 μM) could enhance the inhibitory effect of sorafenib on drug-resistant HCC cells, increase the level of miR-370 and downregulate the expression of proto-oncogene serinethreonine-protein kinase 1 (Pim-1), thereby inhibiting c- Myc-regulated glycolysis.49 Another study confirmed that combined treatment with physcion and sorafenib significantly inhibited tumor growth in mice. | Aloe-emodin has anti-cancer, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, neuroprotective and hepatoprotective pharmacological effects.118122 The anti-liver cancer effect of aloe-emodin is related to promoting the apoptosis and growth of liver cancer cells. | However, the molecular mechanism by which aloe-emodin reduces the stability of CARP mRNA in cells remains to be further explored.54 Kuo P L showed that aloe-emodin (10 µgmL, 20 µgmL) has an inhibitory effect on both human liver cancer cell lines HepG2 and Hep 3B. | In addition, aloe-emodin inhibited DNA synthesis in HepG2 cells by upregulating the tumor suppressor p16 and inhibiting Retinoblastoma (Rb) phosphorylation, and reduced cell migration by upregulating the transfer of the inhibitor nonmetastatic protein 23 (nm23).51 P-Rb plays an important role in controlling cell cycle progression and cell growth.123 The PI3K-AKT signaling pathway is closely related to cell growth.","China (LOC), ReviewT (ORG), Web (MISC), of (ORG), Science

aim of reducing inflammatory factors. | The pharmacodynamic data can be used to determine whether the NLRP3 inhibitor ZYIL1 can improve ALS symptoms. | At the same time, for diseases like AD and PD,

there are also small molecules that cannot cross the bloodbrain barrier and are therefore not applicable to these diseases. | This highlights the need to focus on compounds with both inhibitory potential and potential for modification, with the goal of identifying compounds that can modulate inflammasome activation without causing side effects or off-target activities. | Another strategy is to develop inhibitors that target multiple pathways, such as combinational therapies that simultaneously target different aspects of the inflammatory process, potentially providing more effective control of neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases. | However, this approach requires careful considerations of compound specificity, ability to cross the bloodbrain barrier, and the overall

7617104.xml,ATP-competitive inhibitors of PI3K enzymes demonstrate an isoform selective dual action by controlling membrane binding,"The identification of common oncogenic mutations in PIK3CA has driven the development of many inhibitors that bind to the ATP-binding site in the p110α subunit. | Upon activation, PI3Kα undergoes conformational changes that promote its membrane interaction and catalytic activity, yet the effects of ATP-site directed inhibitors on the PI3Kα membrane interaction are unknown. | Using FRET and biolayer interferometry assays, we show that a class of ATP-site directed inhibitors represented by GSK2126458 block the growth factor activated PI3KαWT membrane interaction, an activity dependent on the ligand forming specific ATP-site interactions. | We find that an ATP substrate analogue can increase the wild type PI3Kα membrane interaction, uncovering a substrate based regulatory event that can be mimicked by different inhibitor chemotypes. | Our findings, together with the discovery of small molecule allosteric activators of PI3Kα illustrate that PI3Kα membrane interactions can be modulated by factors related to ligand binding both within the ATP site and at allosteric sites. | PI3K inhibitor development has provided both isoform selective and pan-isoform PI3K inhibitors . | While many of these block the ATP binding site, little is known about the effects these compounds have on the non-nucleotide substrate binding functions of the PI3Kα enzyme including macromolecular interactions such as the plasma membrane interaction. | The helical domain p110αE545K mutation mimics the growth factor activated state by blocking the inhibitory effect of the p85α nSH2 domain on PI3Kα enzyme activity and increases the interdomain flexibility needed for the membrane interaction . | PI3Kα X-ray crystal structures show that most inhibitors occupy the ATP binding site found between the N- and C-terminal lobes of the kinase domain . | The inhibitor binding site is adjacent to protein regions that are buried at the protein-membrane interface (Figure 1B), and are involved in lipid binding including the PIP2 substrate (Figure 1B). | The potential for using this to develop compounds to specifically modulate PI3Kα activity has been demonstrated recently by the identification of a small molecule that increases PI3Kα activity and the membrane interaction by binding to a non-catalytic site . | ATP competitive inhibitors can regulate non-catalytic activities in some protein kinases. | ATP site inhibitors can also affect intramolecular interactions as seen by decoupling of regulatory and kinase domains in proteins with Src-family domain architecture . | As the PI3Kα kinase domain has important functional intermolecular interactions including membrane binding and PIP2 substrate recognition, we hypothesised that inhibitors that bind in the ATP site could also induce conformational changes that affect non-catalytic functions exemplified by PI3Kα membrane interactions. | Our data show that ATP-binding site directed ligands including ATP do regulate membrane binding, and that this effect can be either negative or positive, depending on inhibitor chemistry. | GSK2126458 represents a new class of dual action inhibitors. | Results ATP-site directed inhibitors regulate the PI3KαWT membrane interaction We selected a set of potent PI3K ATP-site directed inhibitors based on their differences in isoform selectivity and ATP binding site interactions, these included A66, PIK-75, ZSTK474 and GSK2126458 (Figure 2A, Supplemental Table S1)

of a bis-phospshorylated PDGFR derived peptide (P1pY) in the assay. | All four inhibitors antagonised the P1pY-activated PI3KαWT FRET signal in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 2B), indicating a decrease in the membrane interaction. | Biolayer interferometry (BLI) was used as an orthogonal method to confirm that ATP-site directed inhibitors can regulate the PI3KαWT membrane interaction. | An inhibitor to protein concentration ratio was maintained at 4:1. | Anionic lipids affect the membrane interaction of inhibitor-bound PI3Kα enzymes As the PI3Kα membrane interaction uses both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, we considered if inhibitor regulation was influenced by different anionic lipid species, including site specific interactions associated with PIP2. | The BLI data demonstrated that the oncogenic PI3KαH1047R mutant membrane interaction could be regulated by ATP directed inhibitors, but that this was dependent on the anionic lipid composition (Figure 4B, Supplemental Table S1, Supplemental Figure S2DH). | Both compounds decreased the membrane interaction capacity, while only PIK-75 appeared to have a regulatory effect when PS was removed, and increased PI3KαH1047R interaction capacity (Table 1, Supplemental Figure S2E,H). | We previously described a PI3K inhibitor series that shared features with known PI3Kα inhibitors alpelisib and A66 , differing only in the moieties that access the ATP site affinity pocket with one compound possessing a difluorophenyl-sulfonamide inspired by GSK2126458 (Supplemental Figure S3AF). | We investigated the intrinsic fluorescence properties of this series and considered only compounds 1, 2, 3, and 5 suitable for use in the FRET assay (Supplemental Figure S3G). | Benzene sulphonamide containing ATP competitive inhibitors are more effective at disrupting PI3KαWT membrane binding. | (A) FRET data for 0.5 μM P2pY activated PI3KαWT in the presence of compounds 1 (blue), 2 (red), 3 (black) and 5 (magenta) across a concentration range from 125 nM to 8 μM. | FRET I-I0 values are expressed as a percentage of the FRET signal for each inhibitor at its lowest concentration. | (B) BLI wavelength shift (λ) data for P2pY activated PI3KαWT (1 µM) binding to immobilised liposomes in the presence or absence of inhibitor (GSK2126458, 4 µM; A66, 20 µM; compound 1, 50 µM; compound 2, 50 µM; compound 4, 50 µM; compound 5, 50 µM; n 4 biosensors; data shown as Mean SD). | Superposition of a molecular docking model of 5 in the PI3KαWT ATP binding site onto the X-ray crystal structure of GSK2126458 bound p110γ (PDB: 3L08) suggested that the difluorophenyl-sulphonamide group in both compounds could make similar interactions (Figure 5C). | To understand if the Val851 interaction contributed to the effect of difluorophenyl-sulphonamide containing compounds on the PI3KαWT membrane interaction, we designed and synthesised 6, an analogue of GSK2126458 where the central quinoline group was replaced by naphthalene, removing the hydrogen bonding capability (Supplemental Figure S4). | We confirmed GSK2126458 as a potent inhibitor of PI3Kα with an IC50 of 0.4 nM (Supplemental Table S1), then showed that removing the ligands hydrogen bond acceptor atom decreased potency for PI3KαWT by 1000 and that the compound had similar potencies for other class I PI3K enzymes (Supplemental Table S3). | BLI data showed that 6 retained the ability to decrease the P2pY-activated PI3KαWT membrane interaction as did the extremely weak difluorophenyl-sulphonamide containing inhibitor 7 (Figure 5D, Supplemental Figure S4, Supplemental Table S3). | showed that release of the inhibitory interaction between the p85 nSH2 domain and p110α subunit in pY-peptide activated PI3KαWT increased the membrane interaction. | However, ablating the inhibitory nSH2 interaction with an oncogenic E545K kinase domain mutation that is unaffected by peptide activation rendered the membrane interaction insensitive to regulation by GSK2126458 (Figure 6B). | In all experiments inhibitors were tested at 4 µM with 1 µM of the different enzymes and membrane binding was followed by BLI for 300 s. | The graph shows the wavelength shift in the presence or absence of compound as Mean SD; PI3KαWT pY n 14; PI3KαWT pY GSK n 8; PI3KαE545K pY n 10; PI3KαE545K pY GSK n 4; PI3KβWT pY n 4; PI3KβWT pY GSK n 4; PI3KδWT pY n 4; PI3KβWT pY GSK n 5. | Oncogenic mutations occurring in the p110α ABD-RBD linker region are sensitive to regulation by GSK2126458 To understand if the regulatory mechanism used by GSK2126458 was restricted to PI3KαWT or if other oncogenic mutants were also sensitive to its effects, we studied the membrane interaction affinity and capacity for mutations with diverse and well described effects on autoinhibitory interactions in the p110α-p85α heterodimer (Figure 1C). | ATP analogues and ATP-site directed inhibitors have divergent effects on the PI3KαWT membrane interaction Based on our finding that the PI3KαWT membrane interaction can be negatively or positively regulated by ATP-site directed inhibitors, we explored whether these responses might mimic the effect of ATP substrate binding to PI3KαWT. | We then screened a range of inhibitor chemotypes (Supplemental Figure S7A) and discovered that apart from GSK2126458 no other inhibitors showed negative regulation of the PI3KαWT membrane interaction to a level that reached statistical significance (Supplemental Figure S7B). | Conversely, AS252424 showed some evidence of positive modulation (Supplemental Figure S7B), and the PI3Kβ sparing inhibitor GDC0032 significantly increased the PI3KαWT membrane interaction (Supplemental Figure S7C). | Along with PIK-75, these data show that it is possible for catalytic site inhibitors to also have effects on membrane binding that work against the catalytic inhibition. | The graph shows the wavelength shift in the presence or absence of compound as Mean SD; PI3KαWT DMSO Mg2 n 14, DMSO Mg2 n 7, GSK Mg2 n 4, GSKMg2 n 4, AMP-PNP Mg2 n 3, AMP-PNP Mg2 n 5. | Understanding how small molecule inhibitors of PI3Kα affect essential macromolecular interactions like membrane binding is necessary for a complete definition of the mechanism of action of ATP binding site inhibitors and the discovery of compounds with specific mechanisms of action. | We showed that some ATP binding site directed inhibitors regulate the PI3Kα membrane interaction in its growth factor activated state, with some compounds mimicking the effect of nucleotide binding by promoting membrane interaction while others antagonise the enzymes membrane interaction. | Benzene-sulphonamide containing inhibitors represented by GSK2126458 form a new class of inhibitor with a dual mechanism of action that blocks ATP binding and acts as a full antagonist of the phosphopeptide-activated PI3KαWT membrane interaction. | Antagonism of the membrane interaction by this class of compound is specific to PI3KαWT and is dependent on the enzyme being able to access its basal state in the presence of the compound. | Our results answer the question about the effect of inhibitors on the PI3Kα membrane interaction by demonstrating that regulation of the membrane interaction is coupled to ATP binding site occupancy. | Activation involves the release of intersubunit inhibitory constraints between the p85α nSH2 domain and the p110α helical domain, the p85α coiled coil region (iSH2 domain) and the p110α-C2 domain, as well as intrasubunit movement of the p110α ABD relative to other p110α domains. | Within the p110α subunit, conformational changes associated with activation also allow movement of the helical regulatory motif Kα8 and Kα11, these changes release an inhibitory constraint from the C-terminus helix in the kinase domain and potentially expose the WIF motif important for PI3KαWT membrane binding to better interact with the membrane . | Together, these mutations showed that antagonism of the membrane interaction by GSK2126458 is dependent on the PI3KαWT enzyme adopting a native basal state that includes the inhibitory nSH2-p110α and C-terminus helix interactions. | The nSH2 inhibitory effect results from binding to the p110α helical, kinase and C2 domains, stabilising the C2-iSH2 interaction and preventing the movement of the ABD relative to other p110α domains . | The H1047R mutation was recently shown to affect the p110α regulatory motif, removing inhibitory interactions between the C-terminus, Kα11 and the activation loop, potentially reorienting C-terminus membrane binding motifs into a productive binding conformation . | The inability of GSK2126458 to modulate membrane binding for the mutant enzyme demonstrates that the H1047R substitution prevents the enzyme from adopting a native-like state where inhibitory interactions between the regulatory motif and the activation loop are re-instated, supporting a model where steric effects of the substitution are not accommodated at the Kα11 activation-loop interface . | Based on these data, we hypothesise that GSK2126458 selects for p110α conformations that promote assembly of the p85α-p110α complex including the nSH2-p110α interaction, shifting the peptide activated enzyme to a basal-like state that is less responsive to phosphotyrosine containing peptide than the enzyme with no inhibitor bound. | Our essential structure activity relationship study showed that the negative regulatory effects of the benzene sulfonamide containing inhibitors were most effective when the ligands could interact with both the linker region found at the base of ATP binding site, and a conserved Lys located in the N lobe of the kinase domain . | Communication between the activation loop that contains PIP2 lipid substrate recognition sites , the p110α regulatory motif and iSH2 and nSH2 domains of p85α provide a compelling mechanism for coupling inhibitor binding to membrane interaction . | It may be anticipated that different inhibitor chemotypes select specific protein conformations that have positive, negative or neutral effects on the membrane interaction via the regulatory motif and helical domain-nSH2 interactions. | Our data for PIK-75 and GDC-0032 support this hypothesis and show that different inhibitor chemotypes can mimic ATP and have positive regulatory effects. | Conformational selection within the kinase domain by ATP directed inhibitors involves other ATP binding site features along with the activation loop. | Selection of specific active site conformations upon inhibitor binding is also well established in the p110γ and PI3Kδ enzymes as a mechanism for achieving selectivity . | Modulation of protein conformation was also proposed as part of the mechanism for new allosteric PI3Kα ligands, including the allosteric PI3Kα activator 1938 , and mutant selective allosteric inhibitors STX-478 and RLY-2608 . | Similarly, the new allosteric inhibitors bind in cryptic sites that involve substantial re-arrangement of the activation loop . | Our demonstration that ATP substrate analogue binding also increases the membrane interaction identifies a new, distinct mechanism to support PI3Kα-membrane interactions in addition to the release of p85α inhibitory constraints, release of the C-terminus WIF motif and, partnering with Ras . | In summary, we have shown that molecules occupying the ATP binding site of PI3Kα can regulate its membrane interaction and this has potential to influence the design of new ATP competitive inhibitors for this enzyme. | We provide evidence that a class of benzene-sulfonamide containing ATP-competitive inhibitors represented by GSK2126458 have a dual mechanism, including inhibition of the PI3Kα membrane interaction. | Improved membrane interaction can also be encoded into small molecule inhibitors of different chemotypes as shown by our data with GDC0032 and PIK-75 increasing membrane association and this mimics a regulatory effect of ATP. | We anticipate that deeper understanding of the conformational changes induced around the membrane interface could be exploited to develop new PI3Kα selective compounds with new mechanisms of action that can be used to gain more insight into non-catalytic functions of membrane localised and cytosolic PI3Kα. | Finally, knowledge of an activator site that affects the activation loop conformation and the communication between the activation loop and PI3Kα regulatory features lead to the hypothesis that the activation loop is a central regulator of PI3Kα membrane interaction competent conformations. | Materials and methods Compounds GSK2126458 (SYNthesis and MedChemExpress), BEZ235 (synthesised in-house ) ZSTK474 (synthesised in-house , compound 16 (synthesised in-house following the method in ), CZC24832 (Selleckchem), BYL-719, GDC0941, GDC0032, PI-103 were purchased from MedChemExpress, AS252424 , PIK-75 , Wortmannin (SigmaAldrich). | Inhibitors were prepared and serially diluted in 100 DMSO, and the final DMSO concentration used in the reaction was 2.5.
